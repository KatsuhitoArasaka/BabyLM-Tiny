it. Cool. A remote for the clock. I don't want to rag on your handiwork but we're looking for something that would speed up the big picture not just clocks in general. Oh, good. You ladies are home. It's story time with big brother Chett. We don't want to hear a stupid hunting story. Shut your stinking hole. I'd listen up or I'll snap the ribs from your spine like breadsticks. All right. Check it out. It must have been tuesday. No, wednesday. No, wait a minute. What's the day the trash comes? Wednesday, right? Okay, so the day before-- Tuesday-- I wake up, and I... ( Fast-Forwarding ) ...and then the cat blew chunks on the carpet. Great story, huh, girls? How did I do? BOTH: Yes! Can I hold it? I need to feel its cool, dark metal against my skin. We remember what Lisa said. This thing affects all of time so use it sparingly only in extreme situations. Gotcha. When we left off yesterday the americans were about to join the allied was effort. To recap the devastating attack of Pearl Harbor was still a recent memory. Hit it. ( Fast-Forwarding ) Who can tell me the names of the participants? - ( Bell Rings ) - BOTH: Yeah! Life without the boring parts. - I could get comfy with this. - Yeah, me too. I have to admit this chia pet wouldn't be half as fun in real time. Whatever cranks your cheese wheel. ( Door Closing ) He's here. Afternoon, puke licks. Afternoon, puke licks. - What did you call me? - Puke bag. Butt cramp. Skank boy. Take your pick, dick. ( Yelling ) Chett will learn from this and that brings me joy. But I can't help feeling there's a greater purposis remote. I suppose we could go back in time and avert world wars and snuff out disease. I'm talking about chicks. Gary, it's illegal to go around freeze-framing women and taking off their clothes. I'm talking about relationships. With this remote, we can skip over all that lame getting-to-know-you talky-touchy-feely crap and get to the good parts. - Can I help? - Do you have to explode in like that? Well, excuse me. Who put a kink in your hose? I'm sorry but tierine time-space continuum tends to make me edgy. How do we know he's not, like, awake in there and watching everything we're doing. Relax. It's your personal remote. You are the only two people who have any idea that time is starting or stopping speeding up or slowing down. To everyone else, life proceeds as normal. WYATT: Where are we in all this? You'll have experienced everything. You just won't have any memory of it. It's what you wished for-- the ability to skip through the boring parts. So we could use it on dates. Sure, if you want to. I don't know. I'm not sure we should mess with the forces of romance. Wyatt, if we don't let me explore the wide world of women we're doing a disservice to science. WYATT: To you want. Who am I to stand in the way of science? Thank you. Ready? ( Yelling ) What the...? - Hi. - Hi, Gary. I can't stay out late and I don't like movies and I don't eat fried foods. Let the fun begin. You know, I had an okay time tonight. You did? Nothing seemed unusually... unusual? Everything was fine. I guess this is where I kiss you good night. Whoa. I made it clear. I just want to be friends. - Geez, Gary. - Right. Well, I guess this is where I kiss you good night. You took me to that dump you made me pay and then your nosebleed ruined my blouse. Kiss this! - Good night, Gary. - Yeah, well... - Good night. - Wait a minute. I thought maybe... I don't know... Do you want to kiss? You want to kiss? Me? After everything that probably happened on this date? After the way I probably treated you? After the stupid things I probably said? I'm losing the mood here. - That was nice. - Yes, it was. Good night, Gary. Yeah, well... good night. Wait a minute. I thought maybe... I don't know... Do you want to kiss? That was... Good night, Gary. Want to go out again? - Next saturday? - Great. I can't believe we've been only dating a week. It feels like longer. To you, maybe. Is this a button or a zipper thingy? Gary, stop! When do you want to go out again? I don't know. How about thursday? Something tells me you're not having a good time. It's that stupid remote. I thought you were having fun with it. Gary's having fun with it. I'm stuck watching clocks spin. Every time he fast-forwards through his dates my universe goes on a caffeine high. I don't remember what day it is anything I did this week-- I can't even watch TV. Althrough it does liven up Pbs. You're just mad at Gary for having a little fun with his newfound toy. "A little fun"? Hmm. I see your point. He's playing with the forces of natures all just to get girls. Ugh. See? It's all fun until someone loses a sandwich. It's so romantic out here. Sometimes, if I close my eyes it reminds me of the farm we used to spend summers at when I was... ( Fast-Forwarding ) ...and other times I just wish I could live there for the rest of my life. ( Fast-Forwarding ) I really like you, Gary Wallace. Mmm... me too. I think that's enough for tonight. Maybe I'll see you in school this week. It's kind of a special week for me, you know. Right. Special, special. Yes! I like this. Wyatt. Hey, Wyatt! Wait up! Where you been? I haven't seen you all week. Gee, you still know what a week is? I figured days, weeks, and months were all one big blur to you. Hey, that's Sarcasm. You having a good time? Me? Hell, yeah. Got my remote. Got continuous lip action. What's not good? Your life may be continuous lip action but mine's like a bad carnival ride. You want to skip to the weekend and talk? No, Gary. I have a french test and I would like to savor every second of it, so if you don't mind could we move through life at normal speed for the next 40 minutes? Oh, what crawled up his shorts? Hey, watch where you're going. Donna! You see that? I stopped that big heavy door with my little face. I hate you, Gary Wallace! - Come again? - I thought I meant something to you and now you do this. Um, could you maybe give me a little hint? See, my memory... - Oh, you make me so mad! - ( Gasps ) And what is it with you and this stupid remote? No! Don't! Whatever you're about to say, forget it! Hey, Ted. How's it going? Hi, Donna. There a problem here? Give me the remote and we can have a heart-to-heart about whatever it is you're rambling about. You want it, bonehead? Go get it. GARY: No! What? - Donna? - I hate you, Gary Wallace! Hey, Donna. - There a problem here? - Oh, no. I'm trapped in time. - I hate you, Gary Wallace! - Here we go again. Donna. What a surprise. I thought I meant something to you. You're right-- it is low. Could I have that? What is it with you and this remote? Hey, Donna. There a problem here? No. No problem here. Give me that. No. No! - Leave her alone, loser. - You want this? Go get it. GARY: No! Let me guess. You hate me. That's right. I thought... You do mean something to me. Oh, then you realize what you did I do. What I did was terrible-- So terrible, it's indescribable. I bet you can't even describe it. Can you? After all we've been through you forgot my birthday. Birthday? Forget? I didn't forget. Check it out. Surprise. Come on, Ted. # Happy birthday to you # # Happy birthday to you... # You're pathetic. And you're too mature to throw that remote. There are now ten minutes left. There are now ten minutes left. Oh, no. What's happening? # Happy birthday to you... # I hate you, Gary Wallace! I just wanted to sing you happy birthday. - It is your birthday. - My birthday was yesteday. You didn't even get me a card. I must have told you five times in the last week. Do you ever listen? Of course I listen to you. Ted! Oh, yeah? Then what's my favorite movie, huh? Who's my favorite group? Where do I spend my summers? I know that one. Some farm, right? You don't know a thing about me. Okay, you got me. I don't know a thing about you. I just want that remote. Ted! I'm sorry. Ted's being detained. I'll take that. Leave her alone, loser. There are ten minutes left. Uh, something is very wrong here. Est-ce qu' il y a un probleme? Yeah. I really got to... Uh-uh. En francais. Je vais aller de la... de la... mon ami, um... There are ten minutes left. - Monsieur Donnelly. - Sorry. Go to run. Not as fast, young man. What do we know about running in the hall? Now, I know this may sound like I'm coming down on you but I remember one eyeless lad skewered by his own el marko. I don't have time! There are now ten minutes left. ( Groaning ) Lisa. Get me out of this loop. Please, make it stop. Once a wish is in motion, I can't turn it off. I can't do it anymore. You can't give up, Gary. There is a way out. I hate you, Gary Wallace! I'll never get that remote. You really want it back that badly? Skipping the dull parts hasn't made your life any better. Maybe those dull parts are more important than you think. Are you just going to lie there? Otherwise... I hate you, Gary Wallace! There are now ten minutes left. Monsieur Donnelly. Ah, what the hell. Viva la france! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. I think Wallace here needs a little attitude adjustment. GARY: Go ahead. You might as well hit me. I mean, I would if I was you. I missed my girlfriend's birthday! No present, no card. Not even a phone call. I'm jerk. I thought I meant something to you. Ted, do you mind? I'm starting to lose feeling in my brain. You know why I didn't but you anything? Because there's no present in the world that could express how deep my feelings run for you. You're not buying any of this, are you? Nope. Go fetch. Wyatt! Incoming! Yes! Get me out of here. Fast-forward, pause, freeze-frame-- something. Not this time. I promise you'll get to hit me. Just a minute. Donna! Wait. Okay, I admit it. I never really paid any attention to you or the relationship. I just wanted to make out with you. And that's your apology? Yes. No. I don't know. I'm trying to be honest here, okay? I like you a lot. I really do but I love making out with you. You dress incredibly hot. You smell... so good and you have the softest lips in the entire universe. I kiss you... I'm in heaven. I don't know whether to hit you or pull you in some dark corner. Well, I... I'd definitely go for door number two. You're pretty twisted, Wallace. But awfully cuddly, don't you think? I got to go. I'll see you later, Gary. later? As in date later? You're a pal. Thanks for not zapping me out of there. Any time. And if you ever again force me to deal with my real-life situation head-on I'll kill you. Okeydoke. Mr. Wallace... would you care to do the honors? With pleasure. ... And if you ever, ever mess with my gun rack again I'm going to ram my fist down your throat and pull out your colon. Got it, girls? I don't think we'll be needing this anymore. Captioned by Grantman Brown Long ago, when the line between Good and Evil was clearly drawn twin brothers faced each other in battle. Good was triumphant, and the Knight buried his brother. Now, a thousand years later, the struggle continuous. THE WANDERER Episode 3 "BRIDGES" Where did you get that sword? It's very old. It could inflict a lot of damage. It could. I got it from my very old friend. What now, I wonder? Sorry I asked. So you're not gonna leave me alone, then? I'm suppose to... - Where to? - Good question! Better make it all the way. That's the lot, then. Not a lot for the lifetime. Is it? - It was enough once. - Gone the place was worth living in. They will keep at you until you do leave. To go where? You are going to your daughter. Where would I go? Anywhere. Anywhere but here. You'd better go, then. It's a long drive. I do you'd come-up with something flowery and sentimental. You keep your head down. If they try anything, you call the police. I will write. That will be something new. Since when did you write? Anna! Maybe it's almost time to be together again. Time, lad... to become what you've always been. I'll just have to keep moving. Alone maybe, I can fight back. I had a dream. What have you done to my garden? I am afraid that Herr Director is not available. He's traveling. Yes... Yes, extensively. No, I can't put you in touch with him. His instructions were quiet explicit. I have his authority. Now, while you think on it, if you will excuse me, I've got people waiting. Thank you. I'm sorry, sir. But there's a problem with the elevator. I wish you wouldn't do that in there, Godbold. Constantly do it anywhere. I've lost it. It's gone. Inconvenient for you. But it gives us back our elevator. I'm gonna go wrestling. There's nothing like a good bath of competitive wrestling to really clear out the meditative tubes. I need a workout. This is not something I could authorise expense wise. Oh, don't start getting a financial coronary. I'm talking about professional wrestling. I get paid cash! What if Herr Director should be in trouble? He's always gonna be in trouble. It's his lifestyle, though? It's no way to run a business. Don't worry! I'll always be there when he needs me. I have ways of keeping in touch. Your psychic range at the moment is not all that impressive. And what happened when you left the canton? I got a job at this modeling agency. And then the pictures? Not at first, I did a spell with welfare services. Cares about phys weighing heavily again? That might hurt, she has moods. He's started yet on his nobody understands what a burden of responsibility he carries? Supplying truth. When he does, do you bring sandwiches? Because it's going to be a long night. And all this mark you, because she's putting on weight around the hips. Lair! Well...? The Hermit is planing to wrestle. Do we know where? Yes, we know where. And what are his chances do you think? Pretty fatal. I'm coming, Anna. I hope you're waiting for me. Have you seen the sight of that water? You don't wanna be in there. Leave me alone! Carrying some weight here? Leave me alone! I don't think alone - it's a good idea right now. Who asked you to poke your nose in? Look at my coat! It has to be admitted, there is a hole in your coat. What kind of twit goes around, punching holes in peoples' coats? You're fiery old man. You deserve more than lung full of dirty water. - That's for me to decide. - Come on! Let's get you home, Oscar. You know my name? How come you know my name? I don't know. What the hell are you doing with the sword? I don't know that either. You don't know much, do you? Hey, don't push your luck. I can always dash you back in. You want to try it? Go ahead - try it! I wouldn't dare. Who are you? Somebody who needs a bed for the night. You don't look like anyone who needs a bed. Never can tell. I'm a wanderer, Oscar. No place to lay my head. You're not invited, anyway. Leave me alone. Now, what sort of person would leave a guy with a hole in his coat? You're walking into trouble. I'm warning you. Okay. You'll see. Anna, I'm so sorry. Are you sure you want to stay in? Why do they do it? How long you've been living with this? More than a year. We told a landlord, we told a police... Nothing changes. All the old people started leaving. Then... There was just me and Pauli. Now Pauli is gone. Have you known when you can go to? I'm on my own these days. I'm glad... she missed all this. Keep an eye on the Wanderer, Lord. Till he grows in confidence of doing thy work. I understand that the way ahead for both of us requires me to keep in shape. But, oh Lord! Deprive not thy servant of the comforts of the bread pudding. I could murder one, Lord. Sometimes thou ways are peculiarly narrow in terms of calories. Is he any good as a wrestler? He used to be. That was a thousand years ago. God bless you, my son. Anything that I can do for you, gentlemen? - Yeah, you can... - No obscenities, please. - Not in front of the children. - Are you with the old guy? Well, I wouldn't say with. I'm passing stranger. You should take him away, before he gets hurt. I'll bite his ear off. That's what I'm gonna do. I'll bite his ear off. He does to. He's got a collection. And that's only one that haven't eaten, my friend. - That ones! - Not there, Oscar. Well, it must be off. We can't stay and neat chatting all day. Have a good time, Oscar. You're not going to help me. I do it myself. I get one of them, anyway. Pay no attention to him. He's just a little exited. I knew when you came through it. I get no help. I'll just get him home. Temporally of course, to pack. Nothing elaborate. Just a small suitcase. That's a good idea. You should have left me at the canal. I would have been in peace by now. How do you know? Being dead might be very noisy. That'll do for me. - Just the one night? - Yeah, that's right. You're here for the fights? Does it show? I like wrestlers. I don't know why it is, but I always liked wrestlers. I could really do without any complications. They come anyway, don't you find? Yeah. - You're ready? - To run? They're waiting to see us leave, Oscar. - You've been a great help. - I'm new at this. Pretty quite, I bet. - A door was open, so we came in. - Going to throw us out? There's something about you I don't like. Getting very crowded in here. Tell you what I think we might do. I think we might leave right now. Come on, Oscar. Excuse me. You'll pick just other mean one day, old man. If I was young, I'd sort this mob out. Is this what you brought him for? Teach us a lesson? They're laughing at you. - Looks that way. Yeah. - Don't you care? It's not over yet. How do we get through? It will be right. I just figured out what in this case. It's his party dress. - I need to practice my wrestling. - What now? The fight is tonight. It's going to be very inconvenient on the full stomach. - Oh, I didn't eat much. - I did. Don't look now... - I think we're about to be marked. - How interesting. Sometimes I can't open think that somebody out there is really looking after us. Gentlemen, this just isn't your lucky night. Oh, I want it to keep a bit longer, but he's sitting next lout. It's a diet. They just don't get the calcium. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. Are you sure you've got the right place? I'm sure. Tell your wife, everything will be okay. You know Elsa? I know she'll get better. What are we doing here? What did you have in mind, a park bench? - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. I'd like one of your best suits, thank you. I'm sorry, but we've no suits available. I think we'd better go. Walter? It's Adam. I'm with one of your hotel management people. Can you have a word with him? Yes. A key. This way, sir. If there's anything at all, you'll require, please. Please, do not hesitate to pick up the phone. It will get my personal immediate attention. We need nice pare of pajamas and a dressing gown for this gentleman. - You can go up with us. - Yes. Quite a sight, isn't it? Thank you. Well, have you had a good look around? Haven't you found anything to be grumpy about? I'm sure you will find something to grumpy about, won't you, Oscar? Who are you? I'm someone who used to live like this. Come on! - Who will the monk be wrestling? - The Prussian Bear. Can you do him? I can do any of them. - He's very large. - I can do him. Good luck. I've pulled out all the stops, mister Godbold. A meal fit for a King. Oh, that's beautiful. That's er... just... It's beautiful. Would you say grace? Oh Lord... Why are you doing this to me? Make us truly thankful, for what we are about to receive. - You can drink that and get some sleep. - Sure. Tonight I'll sleep. What about tomorrow night? - Who knows what tomorrow brings? - Great! Just what I need. A philosopher. You really wanna go back to that place? That place is my home, my top. When she was alive it was like... Well, it was home. That was then, Oscar. Look at the place now. It's my home. Right, I guess that's the bottom line. The stone reveals the man. So let's see what I made, alright. Eh, go home! When I asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up... was it that? Then you won't need this. Do you love this girl? Then you're supposed to take care of her. Go home. Get out of here before you get hurt. You're poising children. Don't do it anymore. - I am warning you. - That's not nice. I'll be in Oscar's house if they're looking for me. Oh Lord... Preserve thy servant from the temptations of the flesh. For as you well know it got me into more than enough trouble when I was pluming. I brought you nice cup of coffee, Mr. Godbold. I thought you like something warm. Take care of your problem? - Yeah, it's done. - Good. Anymore call to the police, when we will manage this quarter. They gone. All gone. Wolfe, he's back. - Whose back? - The one with an old man. He can't do anything. Forget him. - A problem? - No. No problem. - Make sure it isn't. - Decker, take those two. Bring that creep back here. I don't care if he's breathing. A problem solved. How can people came and watch this stuff when no-one gets killed? Your luck's in. Tonight someone will get killed. - That meddling monk. - The Romans did it better. Testing... Testing: one, two, three... When Liberty Valance walked to town, the womenfolk would hide they'd hide. When Liberty Valance walked to town, the men would step aside... - What do you think you're doing? - I've turned you off. - But they love me! - Who? Where? Showbiz. Such a wretch feel for being Evil in. Even you might find some pretty heavy competition there. Speaking of pretty heavy... Let's see your party trick for the evening. Now? No time like a present. Beatrice! That is gross! No! Not the claw! I may never approach you again! Hear that, twin? ! Can you hear that, twin? ! Your sometimes holy man is about to die! You are going to loose your technical adviser. Come on, Godbold. You are in danger. He was just here. Forget it, he's gone. No. Some people just don't learn. The way is open, you free to leave, before you get hurt. Why are you doing this for an old man, that nobody cares about? Maybe that's why. They will kill you, they don't care. You tell 'em I'm waiting. It's not me. Thanks. - He get a jump on us. - But you got away. Because you shouldn't send a girl to do a man's job. I'll do him. With pleasure. Come on, guys! Does your Mommy know you're out? You're not that cool. He can't be that cool. Oh Lord! Look at the size of him. Be not too hard on thy servant who sometimes breaks training. Oscar! Who else? I thought I left you tucked off in bed. I prefer my own bed. Alright, but you must stay inside. - What about you? - Nevermind me. I'm not going to leave you alone. Listen, I need a favour. Take this number. A man named Godbold will answer. Tell him, his life is in danger. Oscar, please! This is important to me. The way to a happier and healthier life is on foot in that direction. You must want to be dead. I just want you to be a better neighbor. But it's already too late for that. Head from the master recently. You're witch! Get him! Now! One, two, three! Out! Mister Godbold! How loud can you scream, old man? You'll never know. I'm warning you. Don't mind about me. Kill him! If he dies you die. So how do you want it? I don't want it at all. How do you want it? I came to warn you that... Thanks for the warning. You were so magnificent, Mr. Godbold! It was wonderful to watch you. I know, but maybe... Maybe you'd better wait for me outside. If you insist. What is it? This is the real Prussian Bear. But I thought... Who was that, then? That was an old foe of mine. We bit off more that we can chew, didn't we? I had him in a headlock. He used his elbow. Illegally. What kind of monk uses his elbow illegally? Wish I had my Michael Bolton Greatest Hits. Oh no, not again. Alone and afraid, she prayed that he'd return that fateful night. That night. When nothing she said could stop her man from going out to fight. From the moment a girl gets to be full-born the very first thing she learns. When two men go out to face one another only one returns. Everyone heard two shots ring out, or one made Liberty fall. The man who shot Liberty Valance. He shot a Liberty Valance... He was the gratest of them all. Wait for me! You'll be back? - Yeah. - And you? Will you be back? - I have to go now. - Why? Don't be stubborn, Oscar. You've got your own problems, haven't you? Maybe... I could help? You don't want me around. And I've put a hole in your coat. You know, I think your old friends might start coming back here. This could even turn out to be a decent place to live. You take care of yourself now. Coming from a grumpy old man, that's practically an order. Waiting for me? I guess bridges were meant to be crossed... Subtitles created by DimDimCh and Alexander Is. He is immortal. Born in the Highlands of Scotland, 400 years ago. He is not alone. There are others like him. Some good, some evil. For centuries, he has battled the forces of darkness... with holy ground his only refuge. He cannot die unless you take his head and with it, his power. In the end, there can be only one. He is Duncan MacLeod-- the Highlander. Here we are Born to be kings We're the princes of the universe I am immortal I have inside me blood of kings I have no rival No man can be my equal Take me to the future of your world Violence continues to stalk... the suffering civilians of this one-peaceful mountain region... as the warring factions continue to hammer at each other. The only hope for the people of this shattered land... is a truce between rebel leader Paul Karros... and the better-armed forces of President Bourchek. Even as a U.N.-inspired arms embargo tightens its hold on the isolated rebels, Mr. Karros vows to continue the struggle... until some kind of victory is achieved. Come on! Let's get outta here! Move! Let's get outta here! Wars and revolution... have their own pacing, Myra, their own time. The question is not if we will win, but when. The city is falling around our ears, and you still believe that? Well, how can I lead these men and believe anything else? 60 minutes? Have you heard anything from them? No. Well, get on it! I need to get on that show and talk about the arms embargo! It's imperative! They want fact, Paul, not poetry. They want to know how men armed with rifles are going to defeat Bourchek's tanks. These men are capable of more heroism than you can imagine! All they need is the proper motivation. My motivation! Come on! Who is he? Their motivation. Do you know who this is? This is one of Bourchek's secret police. And look, a colonel! Is this what you fear? Are you still afraid? The men you face tomorrow are just like him, and they die just as easily. To victory. To victory. To victory. To victory. To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! To victory! Well, I think that, thanks to Father Stefan, the congressman has begun to see things our way. Mr. Karros, I'm Alan Mason, KHI TV. Will the congressman vote to end the arms embargo? The congressman is a man of peace. He'll vote his conscience. I've heard stories about Karros all over Africa, Central America. They say he can turn villagers into Green Berets in a couple of weeks. How long have you known him? A while. Oh, so you're not gonna tell me about him? Probably not. You're a real public library, MacLeod. It's rumored that the truce was broken... by your attack on a tank battalion. Mr. Mason, you seem to be a reasonably intelligent man. Would you charge a tank with a pistol? My people are brave, but they aren't fools. They fight for peace. The truce was broken by Bourchek. Why would Bourchek break the truce? What did he hope to gain? The annihilation of our people. You called Bourchek the aggressor. But aren't you doing the same thing? Mr. Karros? My friend, I've been cast into the role of a warrior. Those who know me know me as... a man of peace. Viva la revolucion! Wake up, Mac. Let's celebrate. Tomorrow we'll be in Queretaro, and all of Mexico will be ours. Not our, Karros. Theirs. Okay, theirs. What's the difference? We're on the same side, aren't we? Which side is that? The side of justice, glory. Maximilian has been trying to abdicate and go home to Austria for two years. He's a puppet. I think he'd go home on his own if we'd let him. I never thought you'd change. You know that? Duncan MacLeod, the pacifist. You were never a slave. So? So, life was the property of the Roman Empire. I was a gladiator, trained to die... for the frivolous amusement of Romans. You must've been a great disappointment to 'em. Oh, I was a hell of a disappointment. See, they had choked on me and Spartacus. He was a Thracian, like me. Did I ever tell you that? Yeah, several times. Spartacus was a great leader, Mac. He convinced a bunch ofslaves... that they could defeat the Roman Empire. Ninety thousand of us ended up with him. Yeah, all of which were crucified, burned or hung. They died free. Spartacus may be gone, Mac, but I still hear his voice and I carry his fight. Be careful when you hear voices from the past, Paul. Time can make you a liar. Rapido. Rapido. My leg's broken. Come on, just a little further. Right here. Gracias. There. Keep the tourniquet tight and try to keep the wound clean. How goes the battle? I think we're winning. I wonder if they'll be celebrating. Here. I'm sorry. I am very tired. You have a right to be. When I was at the university, I'd heard about the price... the peasants were paying for the revolution. I was sure their freedom was worth dying for. And now? His name is Juan. He's a miner in San Juan del Rio. That's Julio and his girlfriend Maria. I think if you ask them if they could choose to fight, knowing that they might die, they would. They're so young. What good is being free if you're dead? Maybe they believe there's some things worth fighting for. Like our revolution? Would you die for our revolution, senor? I have to go. What is your name? Duncan MacLeod. I'm Elda Gutierrez. Vaya con Dios, Duncan MacLeod. Bourchek says that you lead your men to suicide in order to get into the evening news. Mr. Bourchek's a liar. He lies to his army. He lies to his people. Why shouldn't he lie to you? If he wants peace, let him come to the table. We've endured much at the hands of Bourchek. Our homes are destroyed, our women taken, our men shot in the street, and the world sat by and watched. That may all change, thanks to men like Father Stefan. If the embargo is lifted, Bourchek will be forced to negotiate... and I'll embrace him with open arms. Get down! Father. After him! Someone get an ambulance, quick! Okay, what's going on? Pulse is 130 and shallow. He's in shock. He's moist and cool. What's hanging? - Two large IV's. - What's his name? -Stefan Metullo. - He's a priest. Okay, Father, you hang tight. You're gonna be okay now. Come on! Let's go! Get him typed. Let's move it! That bullet chopped up his liver pretty bad. Come on, people. He's not gonna make it. Dr. Foster to E.R., stat. Doctor, so how is he? Well, he's been better. Are you saying he's alive? Don't look so surprised. I've had four shootings today, and I'm three for four already. Doctor, when will the press be able to speak to him? The press? I'd let Father Stefan make it through intensive care... before you start booking a speaking tour for him. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me. Mac. Myra Leonin, Duncan MacLeod. Pleasure. If we had this man on our side, we wouldn't need an army. You and me against an army, Karros. You must've gotten better since the last time we met. Yes, maybe both of us have. We're both still around, aren't we? Myra's been with me since the beginning. She was one hell of a reporter in the capital... until Bourchek's artillery leveled the building... and killed the publisher. Sometimes a free press means free to be murdered. Hmm. You know, I served some time down in El Salvador, just around the time you were working that neck of the woods. That was another war. Seems like such a long time ago. I take it we were on different sides? Oh, I was an advisor. Mostly, I tried not to be on a side. No, there was no up or down in that one. There's always a right and a wrong. At least that's what the spin doctors want you to believe. MacLeod, you know, maybe you've changed more than I thought. It's not like you to leave a friend standing with an empty glass. You with an empty glass- - This is exactly like the old days. Thank you. For what? For helping Father Stefan today. Well, look, um, where are you staying? A man from my country made his fortune here. Two days ago the world was crumbling around me, and now I'm staying in a mansion. Yeah, I remember how weird it was to come home. One day I'm ducking bullets in El Salvador, and the next day I'm drinking beer in my buddy's basement. But I'm still ducking Bourchek's bullets. If he got to us here, it would send a strong message back home. We'll just have to make sure he doesn't get a chance to send another message. - More wine? - Why not? Maybe you're right, Mac-- giving up the life of a warrior, opting for all this comfort. The boredom in my life would kill you. I haven't led a cavalry charge in years. Remember the old days when all you needed was the right cause, a good horse and a good blade? Now an army is run on money, high-tech weapons. There's no passion, Mac. It was always about money. Don't you remember? Why don't you come back with us, Mac? Maybe two old relics like us can lay Bourchek to rest... faster than one of us. I'm not looking for any new fights. As it is, some of the old ones won't leave me alone. You already have the press on your side. It's only a matter of time till Bourchek negotiates. No. Never. I'll never negotiate with men like that. Never. My glass is empty again. So it is. Tomorrow we call out the dogs, Myra. Let's see what kind of play we get from the media on the shooting. You don't have to look so happy about that. Myra, I'm worried about Father Stefan too, but I'm not gonna let it stop me from using it to get to the truth about Bourchek. How about the truth that our people attacked those tanks? The truth is it was necessary. Was it? Yes, it was. I don't expect you to understand, but someday you'll learn that sometimes you need to lose a battle... to win a war. Excuse me. We're talking about truth? And something else. You never confuse people with what they don't need to know. Didn't Bourchek say that? Karros. I knew it. I'll meet you there. Who was it? It's one of our people. He's got proof of Bourchek's involvement. I'll come with you. No, you'll wait here. I'll be back. Anthony? Have you read the evening newspapers? We made the front page. Yeah. The priest was supposed to die. It's not my fault he lived. Blame the doctors. See these munitions here? Cost me an awful lot of money. Now, I needed a dead priest to push Congress into stopping the arms embargo. I did what I was told. I want my money. You want your money? I'll give you your money. Here's your money. Count it. It's all here. No! Are you the guy the police sent to look at the shooter? Yeah. Detective Gord's late. You know what they say about cops when you need them. Every stiff tells a story. We've got a whole encyclopedia down here tonight. Oh, sorry. Licorice. Do you want some? No. Thanks. Shootings. Stabbings. We've even got a "natural causes" somewhere. But this one is really something. Hope you're decent. I hear he shot a priest. No wonder someone was mad at you. Ah, but he's been good as gold for us down here. It's a joke. Oh, uh, any idea on who he is? I think I heard a name. Dourcef. Yes, Anthony Dourcef. He's from out of town-- Europe somewhere. - The Balkans? - Yes, that's the place! Thanks. But don't you want to see the interesting part? Uh, no. It's not every day we get something like this. What do you mean? I mean cut, sliced, like a tomato. Neat job too. See the severing all along there? Bet you're sorry you messed with a priest, aren't you? Bet he is. Morning, Detective Gord. I was just telling-- Uh, it's him. No, this wasn't war. This was murder. A murder of the cloth, a man who wanted only peace, paid for by President Bourchek. And our people will never forget what he did to Father Stefan... nor forgive... nor surrender. Viva la revolucion! That was close. Not close enough. Paul, no! There might be soldiers! This is the emperor's private guard, and they were leaving. You know what that mean? Yeah, it means it's over. The capital is wide open. Let's take it, Mac. Forget it, Paul. The capital was gonna fall anyway. We're through here. Like hell we are. Paul, it's their victory. Let 'em have it. We've won, Mac. Why did we come here? I've done what I came to do. It's their revolution. No. It's my revolution. - The emperor's finished, Paul. - Do you need to see him die by your own eyes? - No, Mac. With my own hands. - Paul! No! Adios, amigos. Elda! Let me get you out of here. No, please. No. No. I've seen enough wounds to know that I'm dying. Just don't leave me, please. I won't. I thought this only happened to the peasants. Maybe you should ask me if I would do it again. I would. Viva la revolucion! Vaya con Dios,Elda. Vaya con Dios. As I told you before, this was no random act of violence. This was no accident. This was murder. Oh, look, it's the vultures. They're here. Would somebody please tell me, who rang the dinner bell? I called this press conference. Ah. This is Dr. Anne Lindsey, the esteemed surgeon who saved his life. I'm Paul Karros, Doctor. You could be St. Francis of Assisi, and I still would not let you turn my hospital into a zoo. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's a bit early for happy hour, so please go. Doctor, Father Stefan would want the world to know. He's one of our people. News flash, Mr. Karros. Now he's one of my people. I barely got him through, and I will not lose him so you can get the free airtime. Will somebody please call security? Doctor, do you know what you are doing? Yes, I do, and I happen to know exactly what you're doing too. And I'm sure as hell not gonna let that happen to my patients. Hi, guys. Would you please clear this floor now? I want everybody out. Listen to me. There's a martyr dying in there-- Not if I can help it, Mr. Karros. Come on. I'm sure I'll see you on the news. Let's go. Come on. I said everybody. Oh, you mean me? Oh, unless you're the one with the special dispensation from the Pope. Oh, well, I must have left it in my other pants. We have a wonderful hearing specialist upstairs. You want a referral? Pardon? Forget it. Get out. Go. Charlie, come on in. Thanks. Uh, sorry to bother you. It's all right. You're not. Uh, writer's block? Something like that. Well, Karros is not here, but if you want to wait-- Ah, well, um, look. I came to offer my help. To Karros? What sort of help? The kind he can use. Hands like weapons. It's what I do, Myra. Karros might need somebody to watch his back. Maybe someone to watch yours too. Thanks, but I'm not that important. Maybe to some people you are. Charlie, are you coming on to me? Me? Yeah, maybe I am. I guess you and Karros are-- Are you and Karros-- You mean, uh, are we lovers? Is that what you're asking? Yeah, I guess I am. No. There was a time that we could have been, but Paul's only love is the revolution. Excuse me. Mrs. Leonin, Mason, KHI. What's Mr. Karros's response to the news? What news? So what you're telling me is that you agree with that doctor. Is that it? You were pushing it, Paul. It's been known to happen. Well, Stefan wouldn't have given it a second thought. If he was conscious, he'd call that press conference himself. But he's not conscious. He's hanging on by a thread. You're getting soft, Mac. Maybe you've lost your fire. I haven't lost it. I just don't let it eat me up anymore. Or anyone else. What are we talking about here, Mac? What we're talking about is Bourchek's claim that your side attacked his tanks. And you believe Bourchek? You believe Bourchek against me? I know you, Paul. I've seen you send men with knives against machine guns, unarmed men against cavalry. I was there, remember? Yeah. Then you should know I never force them. I inspire them. Yeah, well, they died, Paul, and they're still dying. Maybe so. It's better than seeing them live like sheep. The police have found the man who shot Father Stefan. I saw him. He was killed by a sword. You save your suspicion for Bourchek, Mac. He's the butcher. I thought you wanted all the press coverage you could get. - Not now, Mac. - Karros! Well, here's your chance. The whole world's finally watching. Bourchek. What are you doing here? Taking up your challenge, Karros, to begin the process that will create peace in our country. Join me. Champagne. We got a lot to celebrate. I hope you're right. What do you mean? I saw Bourchek holding out his hand. The man's offering peace. You can't trust him. One hand offers peace, the other stabs you. Paul's sure it's a P.R. trick, the way to get Congress on his side. But what if it's not? It's too much to hope for. I've been at war for too long. I don't think I'd know how to be at peace. There's so much to do, so much... to rebuild. Have you ever been to the Balkans, MacLeod? Not recently. Why? Are you thinking of going? Yeah, maybe. Karros thinks the truce offer is bogus. What's this about? It's about doing something important with your life. Well, there are other ways. Yeah, maybe. But maybe this is the one for me. You're serious. Yeah, I think I am. Karros can use me. I'm sure he will. What's that supposed to mean? Some people aren't what they seem, Charlie. So? So watch yourself around Karros. Look, if you got a beef with Karros, that's between you and him. Me? I think he's fighting the good fight. Want another beer? No. Ready. Aim. No, Paul. Don't. You can't do this. You don't have to do this, Paul. You've won. They would've done the same thing to us if they had won. No, look. They're not the government. They're not the opposition. They're just boys in uniform. They chose their side. This is what war comes to every time. - Remember? - No, don't! Sorry, Mac. It's war. Owner, wine. Where is he? That dog. He's probably out celebrating. He's dead, Paul. Well, we'll celebrate anyways. Celebrate what? With who? Look around you. All our friends are dead. What have we won? Freedom. For a bunch of dead men? They died nobly. The war was won! How many children would still have their fathers if we talked peace a few days ago? Well, now they don't have to talk at all. Really? It's the price of war. Just war. It's worth it. "Worth it." And a hundred years ago, you'd have agreed with me. Probably! But now I think the noblest thing a man can do is live. So, what is this all about? It will just take a minute. Ah, you're back! Do you want the whole tour? Uh, no. Just the guy you showed us yesterday. Quite. Cut to the chase. That's my motto. Visitors. Do you know him? Nothing personal, I'm sure. Myra. Leave me alone. I'm not asking you to tell the police. I'm asking you to tell me. He worked with you, didn't he? A dead priest will get the attention of the media. If something like this came out-- It could destroy everything that you've worked for. Paul. Myra. They told me you were here. Yeah. I have a meeting with a congressman. We don't want our friends to forget us. We'll need them more than ever when Bourchek's peace offer is withdrawn. What if heis serious, Paul? Your idealism is very refreshing, Myra. Peace with Bourchek will not come about unless he's dead or exiled. I know. Know what? I know what really happened to Father Stefan. Father Stefan is a brave soldier. He almost got killed by the hands of the enemy. Dourcef was on our side, Paul. You set up Stefan, and you killed Dourcef to cover it up! You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Tomorrow you call a press conference and accept the truce. No way. They'll slaughter us. Maybe. But for now, the fighting has ended, Paul. Are you threatening me? You're not the only one who can call a press conference. Accept the truce, or it all comes out. The lies, the murder. The war is over. Spoken like a true hero, Myra. A cause has always needed its heroes. Or its martyrs. I think you did the right thing. Yeah. Bye. Looks like somebody lost a friend. Or gained an enemy. What's up? That was Myra. You were right all along. Karros is just another battle junkie. What did she say? She threatened to call a press conference... and blow his ass out of the water... if he didn't start to negotiate. Where is she? Gone back to the place she was staying. Hey, you don't think he'd try anything? He doesn't want to stop the fighting. He needs it too much. Myra! Hi, Charlie, Mac. What is it? We need to talk to you. It's about Karros. Listen. What did you do about the press conference? Well, it's all set up-- I don't know if that's a good idea. Wait. Get her out of here. Quick, quick, quick. MacLeod! Hit the deck! - You all right? - Yeah. We're okay. Take care of her. So now you kill your friends as well as your enemies? Whatever it takes, Mac, I will lead my people to freedom. You have no people. We could have fought together again, Mac, side by side. I don't think so. Come on. Aah! Not bad for a pacifist, old friend. Up. You can't do it, can you? There can be only one. It's funny. This time, I'm the one leaving' with the girl, and you're stuck here runnin' the dojo. Sure this is what you want? Yeah, I'm sure. You know, even if this peace works, it's gonna be harder than any war. I'm needed, man. Whether it's to fight or rebuild, I'm needed. I like the way that feels. Hey, are you sure you don't want to come along? We could always use another pair of strong hands. No, it's not for me. Besides, somebody's gotta look after the place. Yeah. Hey, Charlie. Be safe. You know it. And here we are We're the princes of the universe Here we belong fighting for survival We've got to be the rulers of your world I am immortal I have inside me blood of kings Yeah! I have no rival No man can be my equal Take me to the future of your world Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. Los Angeles So you want me to tell you the story of my life. Like I said, that's what I do. I interview people. I'm a collector of lives. FM radio, KFRC. You'll need a lot of tape for my story. No problem. I got a bag full of tape. You followed me here, didn't you? Yeah, I suppose I did. You seemed very interesting. This is where you live? No. It's just a room. What do you say we get started? What do you do? I'm a vampire. I haven't heard that before. You mean this literally, I take it? Absolutely. I was waiting for you in that alley. Watching you watching me. And then you began to speak. What a lucky break for me. Perhaps lucky for both of us. You said you were waiting for me. What were you going to do? Kill me, drink my blood? Yes. But you needn't be concerned now. You really believe this, don't you, that you're a vampire? We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light. - I thought vampires didn't like light. - We love it. I only wanted to prepare you. Christ! Don't be frightened. I want this opportunity. How the hell did you do that? The same as you do. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood but not human. I haven't been human for 200 years. Please... How can I put you at ease? Shall we begin like "David Copperfield"? "I am born... "... I grew up." Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's where we should start, don't you think? You're not lying, are you? Why should I lie? 1 791 was the year it happened. I was 24. Younger than you are now. But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation, just south of New Orleans. I had lost my wife in childbirth. She and the infant had been buried less than half a year. I would've been happy to join them. I couldn't bear the pain of their loss. I longed to be released from it. I wanted to lose it all: my wealth my estate my sanity. How many aces are in a deck? Are you calling me a cheat? No, I'm calling you a piece of stinking offal! You lack the courage of your convictions. Do it! Most of all, I longed for death. I know that now. I invited it. A release from the pain of living. My invitation was open to anyone. To the whore at my side. To the pimp that followed. But it was a vampire that accepted. Give me your money or you die! Do you still want death? Or have you tasted it enough? Enough. He left me there, on the banks of the Mississippi somewhere between life and death. Who are you? What're you doing in my house? I've come to answer your prayers. Life has no meaning anymore... does it? The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it... does there? What if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? One you could never imagine. And it would be... for all time. And sickness and death could never touch you again. Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice I never had. That morning, I was not yet a vampire and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it. I watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time as if it were the first. And then I said farewell to sunlight and set out to become what I became. Have you said your good-byes to the light? I've drained you to the point of death. If I leave you here you'll die. Or you can be young always, my friend as we are now. But you must tell me will you come or no? Yes. Yes. Your body's dying. Pay no attention. It happens to us all. Now look with your vampire eyes. What did you see? No words can describe it. Might as well ask Heaven what it sees. No human can know. The statue seemed to move, but didn't. The world had changed, yet stayed the same. I was a newborn vampire, weeping at the beauty of the night. Perhaps you'd like another cigarette? I would. It's not bothering you, is it? I don't assume it would. It's not like you'll die from cancer. I don't think so. - What about crucifixes? - Crucifixes? Can you look at them? Actually, I'm quite fond of looking at crucifixes. And the stake through the heart? Nonsense. And coffins? Coffins. Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity. Don't worry. Soon you'll be sleeping as soundly as you've ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you and so will all the world. Blood, I was to find, was a necessity as well. I awoke the next evening with a hunger I had never felt. Once you taste this you'll never go to another tavern again. You think so? But what if I'd rather taste your lips? My lips are even sweeter still. My friend should taste those lips. Is his kiss as deep as yours? Deeper, ma chérie. I will not take her life. I've done it for you. She's dead as a doornail, my friend. It's so easy, you almost feel sorry for them. You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to it, all too quickly. Are you not hungry? Au contraire, ma chérie. He could eat the whole colony. I will finish it. Now leave us. Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't give the game away. We're lucky to have such a home. Pretend to drink, at least. Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste. I know. It gets cold so quickly. We can live like this? On animal blood? I wouldn't call it living. Call it surviving. Useful trick if you're on a ship for a month. There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some... Fascination. Yes. - I'm bored with this prattle. - We can live without killing. It's possible. Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport. Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night. A fresh young girl was his favorite for the first of the evening. For seconds, he preferred a gilded, beautiful youth. But the snob in him loved to hunt in society. The blood of the aristocrat thrilled him best of all. The trick is not to think about it. You see that one? Widow St. Clair. She had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. How do you know? Read her thoughts. Read her thoughts. I can't. The "dark gift" is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along. Just take my word for it. She blamed a slave for his murder. Imagine what they did to him. Evil-doers are easier, and they taste better. Where are we going? Nowhere. Now, young man, you really amaze me! I'm old enough to be your grandmother. Oh, yes, that's the don't mind me. -Want one? -No, thanks, I don't smoke. Wish I didn't. Well, go on then, I'll try one. Thanks. -Are you in here? -Yeah. Nobody at home stopped me smoking, you know. All right then, innit? Just that it made my mother sneeze and made her eyes water. I expect that you could in your own room though. The bedroom? Honestly, I don't think I like it very much. Here, let me nip it out, don't throw it away. You're in here as well then? Yeah, I came in of my own accord. They brought me in. I've been sick. I'm better now though. What's that feel like? Got rid of it all, managed to cut it all out. You've got to have discipline, haven't you? Letting your thoughts run away with you like that. I think they're good in here. They bring you back to things. Back to what things? Well, making a go of it. How? You've got to play it their way. Which way? You've gotta keep out of trouble, haven't you? And I've always been in it. They picked me up one night, doing a job. The others got away. I was standing there crying. Me, crying. Crying me bleeding eyes out. What for? It was nothing. A few years like that, things like that... Well, I went straight. Then I start going off me nut, end up in here. I've had the electric shock treatment, you know. -Have you? -No. There's nothing to it, don't even know it's happening. Bit dazed afterwards, the old memory goes off a bit, but they know what they're up to in here. Nobody outside knows. Oh, you've got to get rid of all that nonsense, haven't you? So, that's it. I'm better now and I'm off out soon I thought when I first came in, it's like being a kid again. It's like being back home with the old bastards. But that's missing the point, innit? They know you're not a kid. If you can show to them that you're adult, which you are, if you can show them that, they're on your side. If you rough it up though, it's away with a few of the old privileges. I've seen it in the army, you let men get bolshie and bolshie they are. And then where's it end? In the glass house. None of that nonsense here. They give you your chance and it's up to you. KATE: Yeah, I know it's up to me. -You finish your gardening? -Near enough. Would you like to go for a bit of a walk then? Walk? What's wrong with that? Some of them don't like it. -Who doesn't? -Staff. What I'm saying is it makes some of them a bit nervous. Whatever for? It's a bit dodgy, that's all. We're not doing anything, are we? Look, we're their responsibility, look at it like that. Well, supposing... Supposing that we did do something. Is that what you're after? No, it's not, I'm just asking. Well, it's none of their business, is it? Of course it is. Look, we're in here, aren't we? We're in their charge. You've got a lot to learn. Mind your feet. All I'm saying is... What I mean to say is... You and me, supposing we were attracted, it would be up to us, wouldn't it? You and me? That's a lot to do with why we're in here. No, I can't see how it is. You're an ill person, aren't you? Otherwise you wouldn't be in here. Yes, I suppose I am. Well, try and see it from their point of view. You're not fit to be carrying on like when you was outside. No one's fit to know themselves till they are discharged. I didn't carry on when I was outside! Yeah, well... I can see a look in your eye and see... What? You're fond of me. You like me, darling? No, I just asked you to go for a walk. That was all. I'm not promiscuous. Nothing wrong with asking to go for a walk. You come along tomorrow about the same time, we'll go for a little walk. I've a nice cup of tea for you. KATE: What do you want? Do we want our tea, then? -(STAMMERING) What do you want? -(SIGHS) Sit down, Kate. -It's about Paul Morris. -Oh. Oh, yes. -He's going out soon, you know. -Yes, yes, I know. He told me. Oh! You two have struck up quite a little friendship, haven't you? KATE: Well, no, not really... I'm not all that keen on him, you know. Good, because... (SIGHS) Well, it's not quite the right thing to be doing, you know. -Isn't it? -You know it isn't. You sound just like my mother. Well, I think that's something I needn't be ashamed of. They're coming to see you, aren't they? Tomorrow, is it? Yes, yes, that's right. Tomorrow. And I don't want you taken advantage of. I know what I'm doing, you know. -Oh, I didn't say you didn't... -I can take care of myself... Of course you can. -But for the time being... -I mean, am I misbehaving or something? Well... Shall we say a little self-willed? A bit thoughtless, no more than that. Oh, I see. So, is that what it is? You see, Kate, in hospitals, well... Well, you and Paul, I don't think it's quite suitable. I've heard that, not that it means anything serious, but I've heard your little walks upset Paul. Do you follow what I mean, Kate? No, I'm sorry, I don't. Well, he's not been so good, since, well, you know, since you got pally. Why? What have I done? You haven't done anything. I'm not saying it's you. It's just, well... He might be anxious about you. You think I've made him unwell again or something? But of course not, you silly girl. What on earth would put such an idea into your head? No, no, no. It's just that... He might be -embarrassed. -Well, what have I done, then? You haven't done anything. It's just these walks and talks that perhaps upset him a little when he's going out of here, you see. Tell me... Have I been worse? Well, you haven't been too well, lately, dear. Oh, you've been very good and taking your pills, but, we do have to be a little careful, don't we, when we're not feeling too good? But I don't feel too bad. I mean, at the moment, I feel quite well. -I don't feel too bad. -(SIGHS) You think you know better than the doctors and the rest of us? No, no. Of course not. There. I knew you'd see how it was. You're a bright girl. (THUDDING) WOMAN: Nurse. There, now, Kate. -Get off! -Hold tight. Hold tight. There you are. Easy, now. Easy, now. All right. Hold on. Relax. All right. Good girl. -There, that's better, isn't it? -I don't want to be in bed. Well, we can't have you up if you're going to create such a fuss, can we? -I haven't created any fuss. -What was all that then, with the chair? Now we're going to give you something to let you have a nice sleep. There, now. There. You'll feel much better when you've had a nice rest, Katie. I don't know what to make of it, Katie. I really don't. You know that nurse, love, she was really put out and I don't blame her. But, anyway, there you are. Now look, Katie love, have you been right all these years or have we? -I don't know. -"I don't know"? She doesn't know. Hitting the staff with a chair. Now, look, you said you knew what you were doing at the time. It isn't as though you were ill just for a minute now, is it? I said I wasn't attacking anybody. And then, there's this boy. What's going on there? -Nothing. -Nothing? It's nothing that ends up with you going wild. I didn't go wild. What else is it, Katie? We've heard their story, and we've heard yours. You admitted picking up the chair. Nobody's lying. You know, I think, really think, that you get things twisted, all jumbled up in your mind, afterwards. But you're giving trouble to all these people... You see, Katie love, now, look at it like this, it's you, Katie, you do as you like, you go your own way, but it's us, your father and your mother who have to suffer the consequences for it. You know, love, I hardly dare look that nurse in the face. MRS WINTER: We're not getting at you, Katie. MR WINTER: No, because if you go on like this, love, and after all, they are trying to help you. Well, they'll keep you in here forever. KATE: I sometimes think, if they, if I cooperate with them, I mean, that's how I'll end up in here forever. It's that nurse, she's always dominating me, she's always getting at me. -Always trying to put me down... -Listen, darling. Is it wrong to give you a bit of advice and guidance? She just doesn't like me, that's all. She just persecutes me all the time. Now, why should she do that, eh, love? You see, they're put here, they're trained, Katie. Do you see that, love? They're trained. I mean, there's doctors here, they've spent years. Now, the thing with you, you know, having your trouble, the way to look at it is as though it's just an ordinary physical disease in the body. Do you see, love? I mean, any other way of seeing it is old-fashioned. And all these old-fashioned ideas, they're all going out with... Well, today, you see we've got books and television programmes, and there isn't that stigma, is there, Mother, with it, really? No, there isn't, love. That is the nice thing about it. It's, um... It's just as though you've got a broken arm. Well, that's what I've heard said anyway. -Nothing to be ashamed of. -But I'm not ashamed. Now, look, I didn't say that you were, love. But if you were, well, it would be quite understandable. With the ignorance that's about these days... People who just don't want to know anything about it or couldn't care less, or can't face up to things. -You know, that sort of mentality. -(MRS WINTER MUTTERING) Now, if on the other hand, you get the nurses, who've been trained, who can look at you from the outside, who can see you as you can't see yourself, well, that, you see, is what they call professional. And for you to talk about her persecuting you... I hope you didn't actually say that to her face, did you? Because if you did, love, I mean, she'd hold it against you, won't she? Dad, will you just... Will you just ask her? Did she try to stop me seeing Paul? MRS WINTER: That's all right, love, we know all about it. Did she say that I shouldn't see him? MRS WINTER: What else could she do, love? What would happen if they had this on their hands at every first turn. MR WINTER: Do you not see her point of view, love? -Haven't I got a point of view? -MR WINTER: Of course you have. Have we ever denied it? Have we ever tried to take it away from you? KATE: (SOBBING) Don't want to hear anything, see anything... Now, look, just don't upset yourself, Katie. Well, they've got their... They've got these wires in here they go right inside my head and right into my brain. There's this great big machine at the centre of the earth and it controls everybody, it controls you and me and her... All of us! I can hear it, can't you hear it throbbing? -MR WINTER: There's no machine. -It's a war machine. Look at my hands. MR WINTER: I'm telling you, love, there's no machine... (CRYING) They'll kill me! MR WINTER: Nobody's going to kill you, love. You're all right, you're going to be quite all right. If you'd only give it time. Come along now, Kate. Come along. (KATE SOBBING) -I think we'll be going, Dad. -Say goodbye to Mum and Dad, then. Goodbye, Katie. We'll come again soon. Run along, dear. I'll be with you in a moment. I think it would be a very good idea... (WHISPERING) (KATE PANTING) Not going out this morning, Kate? -No, I don't feel like it. -No. You had a good night, didn't you? Yes, thanks. Yes. Such nice people, your parents. I think we were a bit naughty with them, weren't we? After they'd come all this way to see you. (CLICKS TONGUE) And then to go making your mother... Well, you remember, don't you? It's simply a matter of not losing our temper. Isn't it? MRS WINTER: It isn't the way I'd go on, you see? Not at all. I have to call it badness. I have to say, this matter of sex, you have to be careful and obtain a man's respect. You give them what they want, and there's no respect. And no future. You're no better than a prostitute. And one thing leads to another. Now, you can't say about what you've learnt. Nothing that's good and right from me and your father. And that's what you've got to go by. I hardly recognise you sometimes. You're a disappointment. And this with men, it's dirty, it's filthy. And until you learn some self-control... MR WINTER: I love you. I have since you were little. And I've tried. I think I can say that I've been a good father. And what have you done? You've pushed it all back in me face. Because you're self-willed. Your mother and me... I mean, she's a good woman. And I can't stand to see the effect of what you are doing... What you do to her. Undermining her health. I'm ashamed of you. I just can't put me mind to think of what you're doing and how you're behaving. If she has a breakdown or anything, it'll be on your conscience, my girl. We're not in this world to do as we like. I don't care how free... You see, Kate... You'll find that freedom doesn't come from self-indulgence. But it's doing what is right, and what you owe people. You can't live as if you're the only one breathing. Now can you, girl? So what we're trying to do in this hospital is to help you to help yourself. That's what we're here for. There's no one to push you about or regiment you, give you orders. Nobody here to make you do anything you don't want to, Kate. You do realise that? Everything has its purpose. And I think we know what that purpose is. In the end, it's for you to walk out through those gates and never come back. Isn't it? DOCTOR: Good morning, Kate. How are you this morning? No. Kate, you're not very well? I haven't... (STAMMERING) Really, I haven't... Yeah, I will. I'll let you. You can. Anything, I... Morning. I can "Good morning". Listen. "Good morning." -I can... -Well, there you are, you see? In many ways a fairly typical case history. Happy and sociable till her late teens. Then, in and out of various jobs for a while. Reputation for inefficiency, bad temper, rudeness. Often alienated from the people she was working with through the notion that they were, somehow, plotting against her, or disliked her, or tried to make a fool of her. And she was out of work for a time, and the parents noticed some improvement. From all accounts she became childish and tractable. The mother seems to think that this was one of Kate's well periods. Eventually, she worked again. Then, an unfortunate series of affairs, culminating in a pregnancy which was terminated at 11 weeks. The case notes here include, thought-blocking, over-inclusion, emotional apathy, automatic obedience. She was in seclusion for a time and gained a reputation for smashing in states of catatonic excitement. There were delusions of persecution. For example, that her mother was killing her, had killed her aborted child, that she was under the control of some all-powerful cosmic machine. The family history is negative and there's no detectable relationship between her various symptoms and her environment. Notice the posture, the occasional grimaces, the tendency to mumble things to herself. Well, I think the clinical picture is a very clear one. And the present state of the patient, what one might call a logical expectation, given the case history. Now, uh, diagnosis? STUDENT 1: Paranoia. DOCTOR: Paranoia. What treatment would you suggest? STUDENT 1: Um, that's a good question. (STUDENTS LAUGH) Well, let's have another diagnosis while you're thinking. Another? (STUDENT SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) -DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? -This is probably chronic schizophrenia. -Isn't it, sir? -Yes, now what treatment? -With drugs, um... -What drugs? Largactil. Three times a day, orally. DOCTOR: Yes, any other treatment suggest itself? What about ECT? -I beg your pardon? -What about ECT? ECT, yes. Can you tell me if electric shock treatment does any more than simply shake the patient up? DOCTOR: That patient completely anaesthetised, see? And feels nothing. Afterwards, some temporary loss of memory. Now, something between the teeth, that's to stop dislocation of the jaw. Notice how the electrodes are placed. NURSE: Okay. DOCTOR: Stand back. If I don't get an interview for this I should think I'm using the wrong toothpaste. I'm pulling all the strings, aren't I? NURSE: It'd be a nice one to get, sure. DOCTOR: Of course, we don't know how it works. All we know is that is does work. Quite remarkably. You know how this treatment originated? Yes, yes, it was pigs. More or less an accident, really. Naples, I think. Oh, my God, if we waited until we found out why these things work, we'd be waiting a long time. What are the chances of her committing suicide in the future? Do you think, sir, ultimately, this girl may have to have a brain operation for this condition? Perhaps the abortion played some part in worsening her condition. Do you think the fact that she was associating with friends that her parents regarded as undesirable has any bearing on the development of the disease? Is there any hope for this girl's recovery? What advice would you give about her employment in the future? Do you feel she could be a danger to the public upon leaving hospital? In any way? What is there left after all... After all the forms of treatment have failed? Would you say, at the moment, the outlook is not very good for her? Do I understand that you don't think her family background played any part in her illness at all? What, in fact, do you know about this family, besides the one or two interviews with her mother? With due respect, sir, you seem to be studiously avoiding any, um, environmental factors. You seem to have had a lot of them brought up, um... Strained relationships with her mother, associating with undesirable friends, her sister leaving home, and so on. And you seem to be studiously avoiding saying that the disease is something almost by itself. Surely, both before, as the cause of her illness, and after, as her means of treatment, one's got to take into account her home background. Captain. What is it, Webb? A blip, sir.Just came on the screen. How do you read it? Aircraft of some sort. By the size and speed, it's not one of ours. It doesn't read like anything I've ever seen. What was the approach? None, sir. It's just like it fell out of the sky. Current position? Directly over the Omaha installation. Holding there. Watch the scope, Webb. Air Defense will send somebody up for a closer look. We may have a real U.F.O. on our hands. [Alarm Blares] Space-- The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life and new civilizations... to boldly go where no man has gone before. Captain 's log-- Stardate 3113.2. We were enroute to Starbase 9 for resupply when a black star of high-gravitational attraction began to drag us toward it. It required all warp power in reverse to pull us away from the star. But, like snapping a rubber band, the break away sent us plunging through space, out of control, to stop here... wherever we are. Mr. Spock. Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on impulse power only. Auxiliaries? If Mr. Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on momentarily. Are you all right, Lieutenant? Mr. Scott is still with us. This is the captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments, tie-in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9. Captain. Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries. Engineering reports warp engines nonoperational. Mr. Scott overrode the automatic helm setting. He's holding us in orbit on impulse power. Orbit where? Earth, Captain. We were on a course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. The breakaway threw us on in the same direction. Screen on. We're too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit. Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity. Give us some altitude, Sulu. Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir. Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static. I'm getting something on another frequency, but it's not Starfleet. Put it on audio. [Newscaster] This is the 5.:30 news summary. Cape Kennedy--the first manned Moon shot is scheduledfor Wednesday, 6A.M., Eastern Standard Time. All three astronauts who are making this historic-- Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s. Apparently, Captain, so are we. What? Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain--backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. Captain, I'm getting ground-to-air transmission. Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below, under cloud cover and closing. [Ground Control] Bluejay 4, this is Blackjack. We're tracking you and the U.F. O. I have him on my screen. Following. Mr. Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I want to outdistance him. Picking up, sir. She's still slow in responding. Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4. U.F.O. is picking up speed and climbing. I'm going in closer. Bluejay 4, you should be close enough for visual contact. I can see it now. Whatever this is, it's big. Two cylindrical projections on top, one below. Purpose--undetermined. We have two flights scrambled andon the way. They should rendezvous in your sector in two minutes. It won't be here. The U.F.O.'s climbing away. [Ground Control] Bluejay 4, you're ordered to close and attempt to force the U.F. O. to land. We want it brought down or disabled until the other planes arrive. [Pilot] Acknowledged. Closing on target. Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. Scotty, Activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there. Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile for our tractor beam. [Scotty] Tractor beam on. We have the target. Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. Transporter room. Can you lock onto the cockpit of that aircraft? Scanning area, sir. Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mr. Spock. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. You speak English. That's right. You can step off the transporter, uh-- Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force. Serial number 4857932. Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk. What's going on here? Where am I? What happened? You people-- who are you? All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile... Let me apologize for bringing you aboard this ship so abruptly. It couldn't be helped. I didn't know your craft couldn't take our tractor beam-- Just tell me who you are. We'll tell you what we decide to tell you shortly. For now, relax. You're our guest. You'll find it interesting. Bridge to Captain Kirk. What is it, Mr. Spock? The aircraft has completely broken up. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me. Good morning, Captain. Good morning. Captain. A woman? Crewman. Bridge. Must have taken quite a lot to build a ship like this. There are only 12 like it in the fleet. I see. Did the Navy-- We're a combined service, Captain. Our authority is the United Earth Space Probe Agency. United Earth? This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident. You seem to have a lot of them. However... I can't deny the fact that you're here, with this ship. I never have believed in little green men. Neither have I. Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer Lieutenant Commander Spock. Captain. Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything. You'll find it interesting. Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain. We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a U.F.O. Mr. Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. Very well, Mr. Spock-- Anything else on your mind? Captain Christopher. What about him? We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. And, in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I, and all that we know, might not even exist. Your logic can be most... annoying. That flight suit must be uncomfortable. Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters. Yes, sir. Computer on. Record. [Computer] Recording. [Doorbell Buzzes] Come. Captain's log-- supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and re-energized. [Computer] Computed and recorded, dear. Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute. Computed, dear. Mr. Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired. I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a starbase. I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so... affectionate. It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. I take it a lady computer is not routine. We'd put in at Signet 14 for general repairs. Signet 14 is a planet dominated by women. They felt the ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female, of course. Ha ha! Well, you people certainly have interesting problems. I'd love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but-- I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back. Can't? Spock said that your transporter can beam down an object, even from an orbit this high. It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change its course, destroy it. Then my disappearance would change something, too. I have run a check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time-accident story. The experts can figure out who you are, what you are. It's my duty to report what I've seen. What would you do? I'd...report, If I could. We can't take the risk. I don't want to know about risks. I have a wife, two children. What about them? I'm sorry. [Scotty] Engine room to Captain Kirk. Kirk here. What is it, Scotty? Progress report, sir. Everything's jerry-rigged, but we're coming along with the repairs. We could re-energize in about four hours, but, uh... But what, Scotty? Well, sir, as I say, the, uh, the engines are being repaired, but we've no place to go in this time. If you-- If--If you see what I mean? Sir? Yes, Scotty, carry on. Too bad, Captain. Maybe I can't go home, but neither can you. You're as much a prisoner in time as I am. Captain 's Log Stardate 3113.7. Our engines are being repaired, but we are still locked in time. And we have aboard a passenger whom we do not want, and we cannot return. Recommendation for his disposition, dear. Maintenance note-- My recording computer has a serious malfunction. Recommend it either be corrected... or scrapped. Compute. Computed. [Spock] Bridge to Captain Kirk. Kirk, here. Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher. Important I see you both immediately. Yes, Mr. Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher. Yes, sir. Bridge out. Captain Christopher... Captain Christopher? Security, this is the captain. Security Chief here, sir. All decks alert. Captain Christopher is not in his assigned quarters. He may be trying to escape. Put a man outside the transporter room immediately. I'm heading there myself. All right! Nice and easy. Now I'm going to step into that thing, and you're going to transport me back to Earth. Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse. He'll be coming to in a minute. He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows. Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do? Wait up here for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to eventually, and we certainly can't go back to Earth. It would be worse than the Captain being returned. There are 430 of us. Now, that means 430 chances of altering the future. Yes... We're not in that position yet. I'm glad to hear it. And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong. We're roughly about the same age. But in our society, he'd be useless. Archaic. Maybe he could be retrained, re-educated. Now you're sounding like Spock. If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave. Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? The answer to that is no. Mmm. You all right? Yeah. I see physical training is required in your service, too. Mmm. Crude methods, but effective. What does he mean by that? Just a joke, Captain. You said you had some additional information, Mr. Spock? I made an error in my computations. Oh? This could be an historic occasion. I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. Why? You said I made no relative contribution. Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a cross-check on that factor, that your son Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant-- Wait a minute. I don't have a son. You mean, yet. The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher to go to Saturn. Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of... A boy. I'm going to have a son. Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return. We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it. It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska. That means those search parties will be crawling all over that range. Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures. Air Defense Command will be processing that film fast. And A.D.C. Control was probably recording my radio transmissions. If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sundogs, explainable things-- at least publicly. Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine U.F.O. Possibly alien... definitely destructive. What about our problem, Mr. Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time? A theory... a reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now. We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos. If the captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him. That makes me look like a liar or a fool. Perhaps. Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a U.F.O. Captain, I know that base. I was stationed there a year ago. I'd like to-- No, Captain. Thank you. But if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you... or your son. Well, I'd like to help. I could sketch a layout of the place for you, show you where the record section and the photo lab are. Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums. Me, too. If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise if you start it. I don't intend to start it. How long have they been down there now? 15 minutes, 28 seconds. Well, shouldn't they be coming up? It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case-- Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mr. Spock? I am. Hold it. Get your hands up. Now...one at a time-- Hand me those belts. And the bag. It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now. You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel. [Beep Beep] What was that? What was what? That noise. I didn't hear anything. [Beep Beep] That noise- - It's coming from one of these things. [Beep Beep] [Whirring] The emergency signal. Stay right where you are. One emergency signal, sir. Beam up immediately. Only one signal. What happened? We'll know in a moment, Doctor. [Signal Sounds] Kirk to Enterprise. Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have...another problem. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3113.9. First Officer Spock recording. Due to an unfortunate accident, we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger. Your surprise package is an air police sergeant from the base. Keep him there. No use in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary. I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. Kirk out. What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet? 5:30 in that time zone-- maybe a little after. Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? You've got them all. [Door Opens] We'll try the darkroom. Photo lab. That's... That's it. That's all ofthem. Signal Mr. Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case. Yes, sir. All right. Where's the other one? What other one? Your partner. I saw somebody move in there. No, no, no.Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? No. Nobody should have been able to. Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mr. Sulu. Engine room to Mr. Spock. Spock here. We've completedre-energizing the warp engines, sir. We can refire them anytime. Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. Aye, sir. Engine room out. Hmm. Poor photography. Blast your theories and observations, Mr. Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one. I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. Now, look, Mister. You and I had better start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a simple question. Nobody saw you. You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it? Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. Don't try to be funny. How did you get in? I popped in out of thin air. You seem to think this is some kind of a game. No, Colonel. I know it's no game. What did you say your name was? For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. And how did you get inside a top security installation, James T. Kirk? I told you you wouldn't believe me. Uh... Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? That worries you, huh? Is that a radio, transmitter of some kind? Of some kind. You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like mysteries. If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one-- a big one. I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies, mister. We know how to fi nd out things we want to know. What is that? Is that a uniform of some kind? This little thing? Something I slipped on. Kirk, maybe you don't realize how serious this is. Sabotage of a government installation-- Did I sabotage something? No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we hadn't found you? Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. Is that what you're here for, nothing at all? That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. All right, Kirk. maybe this will make you laugh-- Sabotage, espionage, unauthorized entry, burglary! How are those for starters? I can think up lots more if you don't start talking. All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri, a beautiful place. You ought to see it. I am going to lock you up for 200 years. That ought to be Just about right. He's probably being held in security section. Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take time for someone to get there. Can you give us the coordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? Yes. But you're not going to get them unless you take me with you. I can't do that, Captain. If something went wrong-- Something's already gone wrong. You could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. Mr. Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the coordinates for the transporter chief. Shall I issue phasers? One for you, one for me, set on heavy stun force. Yes, sir. You don't trust me, Spock. In fact, I do... but only to a certain point. Energize. Do they do that all the time? Are you hungry? Uh-huh. What would you like? Maybe some chicken soup. It is. Just a minute, sir. Hold it. [Knock On Door] See what that is, airman. Don't you find that painful, Captain? Yes, I do. What's he doing here? He knew the exact beam down coordinates. It was necessary to bring him along. I see. No harm done. Mr. Sulu, did you check out those tapes? Mr. Spock ran them through. We got them all. They know you've been here. They have a mystery and no answers. Mr. Sulu, signal the transporter chief. Four to beam up. Uh-uh. Not me. Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake. You bet I do-- My family. A son that isn't born yet. You don't have to return me now, Captain. Spock, come out of there. You can't explain your presence here. It's my duty to report everything. That's explanation enough. Spock! You'll go home, Christopher... but you'll do it our way. Over my dead body. I suspected he might not wish to return with us. Four to beam up, Mr. Sulu. Yes, sir. Captain 's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory anda few facts. Mr. Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, Like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me? Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. You won't remember anything, because it never would have happened. What if you can't pull free of the sun? We'll not be getting so close that my engines couldn't pull us out. What I am worried about, sir-- We may not have much control when we're thrown forward again. Helm control? Braking control, sir. If I can't stop us soon enough, we may overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly, the strain may tear us apart. Any way we do it, it's a mighty rough ride. Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance-- especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations. Affirmative. Engineering to bridge. Environmentalcontrol, negative. Engineering control, negative. Ahead warp factor 3, Mr. Sulu. Warp factor 3, sir. I never thought I'd make it into space. I was in line to be chosen for the space program... but I didn't qualify. Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them. Sir, our speed is increasing. We're traveling at warp 8. Mr. Spock. Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And, Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed o ftime passage will now increase. Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about 15 years, so you'd better hurry. Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. 10... 9...8... 7...6... 5...4... 3...2... Now, Mr. Sulu. More power, Mr. Sulu. Maximum now, sir. She's fighting it. Engineering, can you give a damage report? Point 5here. Confirm. Gravity is down to point 8. We've broken free and heading back. Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp 4. Warp 7. 8. Off the dial, sir. Chronometer is moving forward again, Captain. You have the chronometer reading and the coordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard? Computed. Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. This is Christopher. We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Everything A-okay. Uh, Captain... thanks for the look ahead. Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out. 20 minutes, sir. It'll be close. Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energize. 10 minutes. 9... 8... 7... 6... 5...4... 3...2... Energize. You should be close enough for a visual contact. Bluejay 4. Can you see it? What is it? Bluejay 4. Come in. We've lost the image. Blackjack, this is Bluejay 4. I could have sworn there was some kind of ship, but... nothing could have moved that fast. We don't track mirages. Mark it down as another U.F. O. Bluejay 4 returning to base. Out. Approaching second beaming, Captain. Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energize. Now. Energize. Past Pluto, sir. What's our reading, Mr. Spock? Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin... now. Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power. Pulling away from the sun weakened them, sir. They may blow apart if I reverse. No choice, Mr. Scott. Aye, sir. 50 years to go. Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed. 40... 30... Never mind, Mr. Spock. The engines! Engine room to bridge. Engines are on full reverse, and they're buckling! Bridge! Mr. Scott is still with us. Captain. Starfleet Control calling Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise. Open a channel, Uhura. Frequency open, sir. Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking. [Computer] Recordship arrival, dear. Enterprise, this is Starfleet Control. Come in, please. Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home. Kirk out. Coming up on it fast, sir. Are you certain of your sensor readings? Definitely a space vessel of some type. - Origin? - Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights - into this sector for years. - I'm picking up a signal, sir. Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal. - Thank you, lieutenant. - C-Q. C-Q. We're reading it, lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel. Fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. An old Earth vessel similar to the DY-500 class. Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. - Weapons status. - Deflector shields on maximum. - Phasers manned, sir. - Bio-scanners report. Life science bio-scanners are picking up heartbeats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint and average, only four beats per minute. Sensor reading, captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. All decks, go to full alert. Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. Captain's log, stardate 3141.9. A full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel. Our presence alongside is still being completely ignored. Although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard, there's been no indication of danger to us. Weapons Department, maintain battle stations. All other decks, stand by alert. All decks acknowledging, sir. Continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about 60 or 70 bodies, - as near as I can make out. - Alien bodies, Bones? Could be. There's no sign of breathing or any other form of respiration. Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name, SS Botany Bay. Then you can check the registry. No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid 1990s was the era of your last so-called "World War." The Eugenics Wars. Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. Now, wait a minute, not our attempt, Mr. Spock, a group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type: Devoted to logic, completely unemotional... - Doctor, I would be pleased... - All right, gentlemen, as you were. Rig for tractor beam, helm. Lock onto that vessel. - Rigging for tractor beam, sir. - Bridge is yours, Mr. Spock. Care to join the landing party, doctor? Well, if you're actually giving me a choice... I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McGivers? Lieutenant McGivers. Attention. The following personnel report to Transporter Room: Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. McGivers, on my way. It looks like that ship is expecting us. We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere. Very interesting. You ready, Bones? No. Signed aboard this ship to practise medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? - Well, come on, Lieutenant... - McGivers, sir. Energize. Scotty? Definitely Earth-type mechanisms, sir. Twentieth-century vessel. Old-type atomic power. Bulky, solid. I think they used to call them "transistor units." I'd love to tear this baby apart. Captain, it's a sleeper ship. Suspended animation? I've seen old photographs of this. Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018. It took years just to travel from one planet to another. Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? Theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. What a handsome group of people. Jim, I have a new reading. Lights must have triggered some mechanism. Captain, look here. Scotty? Beats me what's happening. We've triggered something, all right. Heartbeat's increasing, now passing eight beats per minute. And there are some signs of respiration beginning. This one was probably programmed to be triggered first. Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant. Yes, sir. The leader was often set to revive first. This would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others. Heartbeat now approaching 40 per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. From the northern India area, I'd guess, probably a Sikh. They're the most fantastic warriors. - Heartbeat now 52 and increasing. - The others? There's no change. And they're all mixed types: Western, mid-European, Latin, Oriental. A man from the 20th century coming alive. Maybe. Heartbeat dropping. Circuit shorting. Probably some dust. Heartbeat now 30, dropping fast. There's a heart flutter. He's dying. - Do something, captain. - Can we? Take an hour to figure out. What happens if we get him out of there? He'll die in seconds if we don't. How long? How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries, we estimate. Landing party to Enterprise. Come in. Go ahead, boarding party, we read you. Lock in on Dr. McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. Magnificent. Captain's log, supplemental. Alongside the SS Botany Bay for ten hours now. A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel. Attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over. Dr. McCoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power. - Kirk to boarding party. - Scott here. Scotty, any records? Log books of any kind? Negative, captain. It appears they were in suspended animation - when the ship took off. - How many alive? Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving 72 still operating. Thirty of those are women. Kirk out. Seventy-two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mr. Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record whatsoever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was 10,000-1 against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip? Botany Bay that was the name of a penal colony on the shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel... If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. Your Earth was on the verge of a Dark Ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. Even a theory requires some facts, captain. So far I have none. - And that irritates you, Mr. Spock. - Irritation? - Yeah. I am not capable of that emotion. My apologies, Mr. Spock. You suspect some danger in them? Insufficient facts always invites danger, captain. Well, I'd better get some facts. - Rig for towing. - Aye, aye, sir. - Make course for Starbase 12. - Aye, sir. That'll be all. - Bones? - He'll live. - My compliments. - No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Now, look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action is twice the power of yours or mine. Lung efficiency, 50 percent better. An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. Be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. Doctor, will he live? Lt appears he will, lieutenant. I'd like to talk to you. If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today... I know, sir. I'm sorry. Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend on the performance of a single crewman aboard. And the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally... Not personally, captain, professionally. My profession is historian, and to find a specimen from the past, alive... I mean, the sheer delight of examining his mind. And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. - Yes, sir, I think they were. - Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. - That's all. - Yes, sir. A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. Fair? Sickbay to lab. - Anything new on those bios? - They all came out fine, doctor. Good. McCoy out. Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. English. I thought I dreamed hearing it. Where am I? You're in... You're in bed holding a knife at your doctor's throat. Answer my question. It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. I like a brave man. I was simply trying to avoid an argument. You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow. I remember a voice. Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two centuries? That is correct. Where is your captain? I have many questions. - Bridge. - I have a patient here - with many questions, captain. - On my way. James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. I see. And your name? I have a few questions first. What is your heading? Our heading is Starbase 12, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you? And my people? Seventy-two of your life-support canisters are still functioning. - You will revive them. - As soon as we reach Starbase 12. I see. And now... Khan is my name. - Khan. Nothing else? - Khan. What was the exact date of your liftoff? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but... I find myself growing fatigued, doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time? The facts I need, Mr. Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. Jim, a little later might be better. Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence. I was once an engineer of sorts. I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel. Yes, I understand. You have 200 years of catching up to do. Precisely. They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Dr. McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. Thank you, captain. You are very cooperative. This Khan is not what I expected of a 20th-century man. I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. Common courtesy, Mr. Spock. He's going to spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selected breeding? There is that possibility, captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over 40 nations. Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves. Because the scientists overlooked one fact: Superior ability breeds superior ambition. Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons. I've collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some 80 or 90 of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. That fact isn't in the history texts. Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some 80 Napoleons might still be alive? - Ship's historian. Lieutenant... - Marla McGivers. Yes. I am told you participated in my rebirth. In a small way. I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals. I don't understand. A beautiful woman. My name is Khan. Please sit and entertain me. I'd like some historical information about your ship. - Its purpose and... - And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion? Lt's comfortable. But it's not attractive. There. Soft. Natural. - Simple. - Mr. Khan, I'm here on business. You find no pleasure here? My interest is scientific. Men of... That is the world of the past. I'm sure you understand, actually to talk to a man of your century... There. Simple. Soft. Please remember. Perhaps some other time when you feel more like talking about the past. I'm glad you came. Please do it again. Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. My curiosity is official, not personal, Bones. Well, he has a magnetism, almost electric. You felt it. And it could overpower McGivers with her preoccupation with the past. Thank you. I hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement. Very good. - Fine technique. - It's a gladiator named Flavius. - He once... - And you've rearranged your hair for me. Excellent. All bold men from the past. Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon. A hobby of yours, such men? I am honoured. Thank you. But I caution you such men dare take what they want. Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey. And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. Adventure, captain. Adventure. There was little else left on Earth. There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. Tyranny, sir, or an attempt to unify humanity? Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? I know something of those years, remember. It was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration. Under dozens of petty dictatorships. One man would have ruled eventually, as Rome under Caesar. Think of its accomplishments. Then your sympathies were with... You are an excellent tactician, captain. You let your second-in-command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mr. Khan. This is a social occasion. It has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed. Many prefer it more honest, more open. You fled. Why, were you afraid? - I've never been afraid. - But you left at the very walk you back. We all will. Won't we, Pat? Ah, yeah. If you'd do me the honour, miss? Thank you, Private Flanagan. You're a real gentleman. (Chuckles) Leave a big tip, mate. I always leave a big tip. PAT: Thank you, garcon. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) KIGGELL: Mr Murdoch, sir. From Australia. MURDOCH: Good afternoon, General. HAIG: Mr Murdoch. I wondered where I'd heard your name. You were the man mixed up with that Gallipoli report. I thought it my duty to forward a responsible opinion, General. Mmm. Perhaps journalism has its uses. It put an end to that abominable sideshow. The war must be fought here in France. This is where the German Army must be brought to battle and bled white. And we need every man to do it. And not be sidetracked by politicians and strategic amateurs. I agree, General. I trust this interview is not going to result in a newspaper article. No, sir. My Prime Minister asked me to call and express his admiration and best wishes in the onerous responsibilities you have before you. Thank him from me. Anything else? He did ask me to raise with you the possibility of all five Australian divisions being grouped together under their own command. Like the Canadians. Out of the question. I will not have my hands tied as to where I can dispose them. It is a matter which both the Prime Minister and the Australian public feel very keenly about. But I remind you, Mr Murdoch, that you are a small country. And your army is less than 10% of the British forces in France. A not insignificant force, I hope. We shall see. They have as yet to prove themselves against a first-class enemy. Meanwhile, it grieves me to say they are creating legal and disciplinary problems out of all proportion to their numbers. Perhaps under their own command... And furthermore I'd like you to convey to your prime minister in the strongest terms the urgent need to reintroduce the death penalty. The Australian people would never again hand the power of life and death to a British court martial. The maintenance of discipline must take precedence over national feeling. Agreed, if that's what's at stake. But our men are all volunteers. The kind more easily led than driven. A dubious distinction. I don't see how volunteerism can replace the normal wastage, let alone losses, in a major battle. "Normal wastage"? About 5,000 a day across the whole front. However, this trench deadlock may soon be a thing of the past. I am preparing the greatest blow of this war. I will put 20 British divisions against the German line and, God willing, we will break through and set the cavalry loose. It may soon be over. (TENSE MUSIC) COLLINS: So when are we moving out? MCARTHUR: Tomorrow. Do we know where yet? The Somme. Then it really is the big push. MARTIN: Sounds like it. They've got more artillery down there than anyone's ever seen. PAT: Yeah, all they need now is someone who knows how to aim it. (Chuckles) At least it's part of the plan. Who wants a drink? MAN: I'll drink with you, Kaiser. Oh, no, thanks, mate. But I'll get you one. You know, I should give this thing back. Blokes all know what happened. I wouldn't let one bad night worry you. Might have the wrong date, but it's got the right name. I'm off. Go and have a drink with the boys. I must be going to bed. Bonsoir. Bonsoir. (Coquettishly) Bonsoir, Uncle Pat. She's got her eye on you, mate. Ever since we got here she's been after you. Ask Bill. Yeah, she's quite taken with you. She's always looking at you. You know what I mean? I reckon you're in there. But it's a one-man mission. The only danger's gonna come from enemy artillery. But I'll keep her occupied on another front. Oh, thanks, mate. Ah, Madam. Oui. Excuse, one more bottle for the boys. Oui. Something special. Ah, you want something a little different, ah? Oui. You wait. Get in there, mate. You're a noble pack of buggers, aren't you? Fly the flag, my son. I will, Bill. MADAM: Whiskey - you want? Tres expensive. Madam. Hmm? Monsieur Cleary. (Shouts in French) (DRUMMING MUSIC) (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) Must get a good view of this. Wouldn't miss this. What a terrible thing to do to a bloke. Here, Roly. (Flanagan chuckles) COLLINS: I don't think this is very nice. Shut up, Roly. Wait for it. (Chuckles) Well, can we go back now? (ROOSTER CROWS) (SULTRY MUSIC) (Men sing) Hello, hello Who's your lady friend? Who's the little girlie by your side? ROLY: When we started our march south to the Somme, everyone was in high spirits. We'd all been told that we were going to join the great battle that was going to win the war. Even the old hands who might have reason to know better were caught up in the mood. We'd heard the guns a long way off. They'd been going non-stop for three weeks, and we were pretty sure that old Fritz must be really knocked about by now. The village they wanted us to take couldn't be much of a problem, surely? That was our last day of innocence. Right wheel. (Men sing) With a girl or two Oh, oh, oh, I am surprised at you Hello, hello Stop your little games Don't you think your ways you ought to mend? It isn't the girl I saw you with at Brighton Who, who, who's your lady friend? Hello, hello Who's your lady friend? (EXPLOSION) (Man yells orders) (EXPLOSIONS) (EERIE MUSIC) (Man yells) Keep it moving! Move it! Sir. (Loudly) Sir! (MISSILE SCREAMS) (EERIE MUSIC) We're nowhere near the drop-off point. We should be way up there. We'll never get to the bloody war like this! Sir, we can't stay here. We'd be better running along the top. Sir, we'll be slaughtered if we stay here! Everyone, out along the top! Over the top! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Where the bloody hell are we? Who knows? Is this the jump-off trench? When I find out I'll tell you. This is the battle that's gonna win the bloody war. Mate, I'm gonna take a look around. Runner coming in. Any new orders? I'm looking for the 4th Battalion. They're down that way somewhere, I think. Sir. (EXPLOSION) We're taking casualties just sitting here, Mr Armstrong. There's another man buried here! I said we're taking casualties! If we stay here, you won't have a platoon left. We're not going stumbling around till I get clear orders from Battalion. Now get back to your post! Ah, Max, my boy. Still delving amongst the dusty tomes, I see. It's my job, Father. So it is. So it is. But have you read what's happening outside these walls? These are stirring times, Max. Great deeds to perform. Accolades to be won. Reputations can be earned which will carry a man far in the postwar world. Ah, I wish to God I was young enough to be with the brave men at the front. I thought you were offered a post in France. Yes, well... (Clears throat) It was decided at cabinet level that my value here recruiting was to take first priority, recruiting fine young men like yourself. Are you saying that I should join up, Father? I'm merely suggesting the advantages which might accrue to yourself and your family - to be part of this great crusade before it is too late. We Earnshaws have a reputation to maintain. WOMAN: Shh. What, what? I... thought about it, Father. But honestly, I'd just get in the way. (Laughs) Oh, come, come, Max. Overmodesty was always an Earnshaw family fault. I was never any good at sport at school, and I get lost more than 100 yards from where the street lights end. I can't see myself being a soldier. Who said anything about you being a soldier? I'm talking about you being an officer. Think... think what it would look like. Earnshaw - father and son, for the war efforts. WOMAN: Shh! What? I'll think about it, Father. You won't regret it. You'll be serving the mother country and Australia. They'll both be grateful, believe me. Ah, I can see it now. Get there after the victory on the Somme, just in time for the triumphal march to the Rhine. Shh. What, what? Sir, I came across a dead runner. The way I read it, I reckon we're still about 200 yards from the jump-off point. (Shouts) Platoon will follow me to the extended line. Move! (TENSE MUSIC) They're Germans! Hold it, Bluey. Hold your fire, men. We're Aussies! What the hell are you jokers doing here? Advancing troops to Pozieres. What are you doing? Just trying to find the village. I think the village is that pile of rubble up there. Mind if I check it on your maps? We don't have a map. That's bloody lovely, isn't it? Neither do we. (EXPLOSION) This is getting us nowhere, sir. If we can't sort it out, we'll have to find company HQ. Come on, sir. The men can hold their positions. Right. Men! Just hold your positions. Sergeant, you put your men up on the edge of the village, huh? Right. Come on, Harry, let's go. Come on, Harry! Don't take this out on me, Martin! No officer can function with orders like these! Hello? Hello? ! Flamin' useless! The shells have cut every line. Sparks, go and check. (EXPLOSION) What do you want, Armstrong? I don't know our jump-off point, nor where I'm supposed to be going. You were told to advance as far as you can. So bloody vague it's dangerous! You're not wrong, but that's all I've got to go on. Have you seen any enemy? They're probably as disorganised as we are. Can I see your map, sir? Map? (Chuckles) I haven't got any bloody map. What a way to run a war! Hell! The biggest barrage of the war, and it's falling in all the wrong places. We could push Fritz to Berlin if we had one ounce of generalship. Armstrong, round up all the men you can and occupy the church out at Pozieres. I'll try and sort out this mess. Yes, sir. Hey... Oh, struth. No live Germans for at least a hundred yards out there, Sarge, but lots of them dug in after that. What the hell are you doing wandering about? Patrol. Patrol? You should be helping to dig in. It's OK, Sarge. We paid Pudden to dig twice as hard to make up for it. They did too, Sarge. And I am. Can you make any sense out of this? Does it matter? Bloody oath it does, mate! If I'm gonna get knocked here, I'd go happy if I knew what I was doing. Do you really think somebody thought all this up? (EXPLOSIONS) (EXPLOSION) (TENSE MUSIC) (EXPLOSION) Sir. "Platoon will capture the remainder of the village." What bloody village? We will advance at first light. Pass the word. (LOUD EXPLOSION) Arrgh! Dead man! (Screams) I could see it. It was there. (Blows whistle) (GUNFIRE) Platoon will advance! Come on, men! Spread out! Keep the line! We're losing our flank. The 4th is in trouble. The German bombers have gotten blocked! Bluey, machine gun on the right! Gotta get around behind them. Now! Let's go! Christ, they're onto us! We're sitting ducks! Move the platoon forward at the double. Platoon! Forward at the double! (TENSE MUSIC) Sergeant, check that end of the trench. Looks like we're stuck here. They've got a feed on us every time we stick up our heads. Take a party of five men and bomb back down the trench behind the enemy. Your objective is to assist the 4th battalion to bring up the flank. Sir. Pudden, grab all those German bombs. Flanagan, Kaiser, Murray, grab those bombs and follow me. I'm with you, Martin. You stay here and cover us. Corporal... If it gets too hot, pull out. Yes, sir. Mr Armstrong, the enemy on the left's holding up the whole sector. Send a party around behind them. I have. They're on the way. Good man. (BANG! ) (GUNFIRE) (MACHINE-GUN FIRE) Cover. There they are. Bomb. Got him. Let's go. Flanagan, cover front. Pudden, cover rear. (Soldier speaks German) Germans, lots of them. Back into the next bay. Come on, Pud. Hold it! Form a bomb block here. Come on. Get back. (EXPLOSION) (EXPLOSIONS) This is bloody hopeless! We can't get past them, and they can't touch us. If I can make it to that machine-gunpost, I'll be able to drop bombs right on them. Don't be stupid. There's lead flying in all directions. If Fritz... What choice have we got? We've gotta get over the top. Alright, you're the boss. Yeah. Pud, give us a leg-up. See anything, Blue? Now! Go! More bombs! (MACHINE-GUN FIRE) Kaiser! Kaiser! Keep 'em coming. More bombs. Marty! They're breaking. The 4th are making ground, Blue. Quiet, Pudden! We've done our bit. Hope I'm not interrupting anything. G'day, Roly. You alright, Pud? You mad bugger, Barrington. I never thought I'd see you again. PAT: There you go, boys. Share this around. Been a long, long while between drinking holes up here. There you go, Pud. You deserve it. Oh, geez! Barrington! Hey, come on, you buggers, this is no time for a booze-up yet. We've got Fritz on the run. Just 200 yards to the objective. Come on! Gawd. More stirring deeds what won the Empire. (STIRRING TIN WHISTLE MUSIC) Dingo, the bottle. (Man coughs) Let 'em be, Sarge. Harris and I will stand sentry, sir. The boys have earned a break. (ETHEREAL MUSIC) (Sighs contentedly) (Sleepily) You needn't have come, Dick. I'm doing the right thing by Kate. At least, I would if I could tie her down. It's all a bit academic, though, mate. We can't get out of this alive. (Voice echoes) You alright, Marty? You were talking to yourself. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. I suppose I must have been dreaming. Ah... you dropped your cigarette. Not mine, mate. Don't smoke. LAD Y ELLISON: Thank you, ladies, for coming today. We have very little time to complete the packing if we're to get the billies to the boys for Christmas. So let us... Uh, excuse me. I'm Lady Ellison. And you are? Mrs Baker. From Tolangerook. Ah, yes. Right, take a place, we'll get started. Try and put a little bit of everything in, eh? That's right, Mrs Baker. Mrs Baker, you can't do that! Can't do what? Well... put temptation in the way of our fine young men. Temptation? Strong drink is an evil thing. It destroys homes and families. You wowsers give me the willies. Who are we sending all this stuff to? A bunch of fighting men or a pack of lily-livered bloody sissies? Please, ladies, please! Language! She was putting alcohol in the billies for the boys. I've been told you both have boys in the same battalion. Do try and be friends. Did have. I'm so sorry. Baker. Dick Baker? Roly said Dick Baker was the bravest man in the 8th. He always used to mention him in his letters from Gallipoli. Dick wasn't one for pen and paper. Look, I've got all Roly's letters at home. We could go back after and you could read them. No! Well... you could read them to me. He was a little bugger at times. Come to that, he was a big bugger too. (Sobs) Oh, God, I miss him. (Sobs) None of this will get these billies packed. Sorry I was a bit snappy. It's just that we used to have a good time with a few drinks. But you had something different. Your husband? Anyway, I'm glad Roly doesn't touch the stuff. Right, take it easy. (EXPLOSION) Kaiser! Don't they ever run out of bloody ammunition? Grab some ammo. Carrying party, sir, what's left of us. Fritz is taking the supply line. We're losing hundreds. We're safer here. (EXPLOSIONS) (Roly screams) No! Are we going to stay here and get blown to bits? That's a ranging shot, sir. Platoon will move to the edge of the orchard now. (Shouts) Move to the edge of the orchard now! Come on, Roly. We're getting out of here, boy. Come on. You're OK. Let's go. Come on! Hurry. Good evening, Mr Murdoch. Please sit down. It's very good of you to see me, Sir Douglas. Now that Australian troops are committed, my Prime Minister would appreciate some account of their progress. (Clears throat) As you are aware, we renewed the attack three days ago. In the three weeks since battle was joined, there has been step-by-step progress across a wide front. However, in the last few days, the focal point of operations has concentrated on the vital high ground here, the heights of Thiepval and Pozieres. The first Australian division has been attacking for three days in the Pozieres sector. And their progress? Good. The Australian division is the only formation to achieve all of its objectives. Surprisingly good in the circumstances. General Haig is referring to the fact that the Germans also consider this vital ground. They're concentrating their reserves and all their army group artillery. All their artillery? (TENSE MUSIC) Hey, there's our relief. They're walkin' right into it. Hey, don't go near that trench! (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) Upton, NO! STOP! (SOMBRE MUSIC) Just like that. Watch your front! Prepare for a counterattack. If this is the orchard, where are the fruit trees? Get down! A couple of questions, Sir Douglas. From the map, the Pozieres position looks less than a mile wide. The concentration of artillery in that small space must be very heavy indeed. Perhaps the heaviest of the war. And our casualties must inevitably reflect this. These, I notice, are yesterday's positions. Have you any information as to our latest progress? Well, the whole area, of course, is covered by dust and smoke. All the telephones are cut and our airmen can see nothing. (EXPLOSION) I need some help over here! PAT: Is that you, Roly? You owe me a dig out. No, Pat, it's me. Roly's not too good. Neither am I, Bill. Neither am I. Here, we'll get you up. MURDOCH: Sir Douglas, as you know, my Prime Minister is determined to commit Australian manpower and resources to see this thing through to the end. However, he will ask me, I'm sure, whether these gains of a few hundred yards are worth the blood expended on them. Mr Murdoch, this war is not merely about gaining ground. Far from it. It's about bringing the German army to battle where they cannot refuse to fight. And once having engaged them, we wear them down shell by shell and man by man. It'll be the side with the greatest fortitude - regardless of losses - with the strongest nerve who will force the decision. And you may assure your Prime Minister this headquarters will not be the one which lacks the necessary nerve. (EXPLOSIONS) (EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE) Why don't the bastards attack? I could cope with the bombardment then. Why should they? They can grind us to a pulp with artillery. Hell of a thing to come 12,000 miles for. I think Mr Murdoch was impressed, sir. Perhaps those colonials will now realise that war on the Western Front is a serious business. Perhaps after this bloodying their conduct behind the lines will improve. Now, what's the latest from General Gough? Committing another corps at Thiepval, General. (EXPLOSION) Come on. Fritz is on the move again. We'll give it one more go before daylight, then we can rest. Come on, fellas. Stand to! Stand to! There's blokes moving behind us as well. Bluey, get a feed on them. (FOREBODING MUSIC) Hold it. They're our blokes. They're relief. Quick, tell Mr Armstrong our relief's arrived. Did you miss your bus? Did you expect flags and a band? What's the situation here? The enemy is 300 yards out front. They're apparently preparing for an attack. We've got one posted there, there and there. What's beyond them is anyone's guess. Thanks very much. Mr Armstrong says he's ready to go. Thanks. Got any SOS flares? Yeah. Give us a minute to get clear and fire them. Cheerio. 9th Section, move out! See ya, mates. Move out quickly and be quiet. They didn't talk about this at officer training. I wonder if anyone's actually running this battle. Just fire the flares, sir. Just fire the bloody flares. (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS) This is a moving occasion for any father. My son has elected to serve his country in the great cause of freedom. We are proud of men like these, volunteering to serve in this great struggle. Is it true, sir, that Prime Minister Hughes is under great pressure from the British General's staff to introduce conscription on account of the enormous casualties they expect? Boys, you know better than to ask a question like that. Is it true? Well, as a confidant of the Prime Minister, I can assure you unequivocally that Mr Hughes will do what is right for the country, bearing in mind the wishes of the people of this great democracy of ours. REPORTER: Thank you, Mr Earnshaw. Blah, blah, blah. But I have a few unattributable comments to make which may be of interest to you. Cheer up, Mum. They'll never let me close enough to the front to muck things up. I'll be a glorified clerk, same as always. I wish your father hadn't forced you into this. Has he ever been any different? Anyway, other blokes have gone from the library. I would've had to go sooner or later. We can't let other people make all the sacrifices. I know, dear. But it doesn't make it any easier. Right, boys, lets have a family photo for the afternoon editions. And let me conclude with a message to all the young men of Australia. Great deeds are being performed in France at this very moment. General Haig's great Somme offensive is destroying the army of Germany. Join now and be part of this glory and build a record which will stand you in good stead after the war. Mark my words, the battle of the Somme will mark the triumphal march to Berlin. Here they come! (Soldiers sing) Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag And smile, smile, smile While you've a Lucifer to light your fags Smile, boys, that's the style What's the use in worrying? (Voices trail off) It never was worthwhile... (MARTIAL DRUMMING) (Martin) "Dear Reverend, "we have just come from a place so terrible "that even a raving lunatic "could never imagine the horrors of the last days. "Nothing published in the papers about it is worth a damn. "There'll be some hair-raising stories to be told "when this war's over. "I know you asked me to write nothing less than the truth, "but I also know I have your word "that none of this will go to my family. "The awful question is "was this great effort of our countrymen "directed by prudent and competent generalship? "Was it worth these crushing casualties?" (KNOCK AT DOOR) Don't get up, George. It's Comforts Club working bee again today. I told Rupert to pick me up here. He's seeing off a parliamentary colleague. That looks like a letter from France. Anyone I know? No, Thea, I don't think you'd know him. Forgive my appalling curiosity. It's just that I haven't heard from Martin for some time and the last letter I received from him could've been written by a machine. "Yes, I am well. Yes, I am alright." Etc, etc. Poor George. You look so tired. And here I am prattling on about myself. Any telegrams today? Yes. Five dead, five wounded. Dear God! Why should the burden of delivering these tragic messages fall upon the clergy? I suppose it was originally proposed so that comfort could accompany the news. It has not worked that way for me. Nowadays if I so much as walk down the street, women are seen to run in fear. Thea, George. Damn rag! Some fellow civilian, of course, gave it to me at the station. The "Australian Worker.' The whole issue is an attack on the conscription referendum. With our men fighting in France, that thing borders on sedition. Oh, come, Rupert. The Labor movement has never made any secret of its views on conscription. The time has passed for the finer points of political debate. They're either for us or against us. Who's "us'? Those who know that the future of a civilised world depends on winning this war. That's a little colourful, isn't it? No! This war is in the balance. Federal Cabinet have been told by London that if the reinforcement rate is not stepped up they may have to disband one of our divisions. Perhaps instead they should think about conserving our soldiers. Spoken like an armchair strategist. Rupert! No. My knowledge of the casualties comes painfully, at first-hand. Anyway, what are we arguing about? The whole question of compulsory enlistment is going to be decided by the Australian people voting in secret, so... It has to be a yes victory. The question is whether the slackers and cowards will continue to avoid their responsibilities. Or whether we should force men to a war 12,000 miles away. Now we see you in your real colours. Why don't you join your friends - The Sinn-Feiners, the Catholics and the Socialists? They all want to bring Britain down. Stop it, both of you! You've been friends for too long. This war changes a lot of things. Including having to decide whether you speak as an Australian or as an imperialist. I'll be waiting in the car, Thea. Take the paper with you, Rupert. It contains an interesting quotation. "A man cannot hate to order." I'm not particularly proud of myself, Thea. Poor Rupert. I suppose he sees this business so intensely because Martin is at risk. I am sorry, George. The bitterness of this war is seeping through the country like a poison. Our young men will not be the only casualties. Pass the bottle, Sarge. It says in the papers there'll be no more volunteers. Conscripts - that's what we'll have next. KAISER: I don't want to fight with conscripts. Yeah? They can take my place any time. Corporal Barrington, this just came through. Congratulations, Martin. Stone the crows! It's a distinguished conduct medal. Is that good? Apart from the Victoria Cross it's the best there is. Onya, son! Ha-hey! Little reward for what you did at Pozieres, Martin. Onya, Marty. Is that what I got it for - Pozieres? Congratulations, mate. (LOUD METALLIC CLATTERING) Take a look, fellas. False alarm, fellas. As you were. Alright, then, instructions. What a fine body of men. Now, listen, Barrington, the platoon is going to attend the area concert tonight. (All groan) It's been decided you'll enjoy yourselves. Oh, yeah? Who says so? The Colonel, that's who. Now, you'll parade the platoon at 1900, then march them to the concert hall. You got it? Mmm. I can hardly wait. Enjoyment finishes 2130 sharp. Now, it's going to be a fine night's entertainment, including novelty acts, recitations and female impersonations. Ooh! That's what it says here, anyway. Oh, they told me to come to Europe for culture. Lance Corporal Cleary ... "Lance Corporal" Cleary? Well, I had to bribe him with something. Anyway, he's been detailed to pick up the stage props. (Laughs) Crikey, what did he have to say about that? If I was a sensitive man, I would've blushed. But I'm not a sensitive man, am I? No. No bloody fear, Sarge. He was also told that it was a request from the assistant provo marshal, who might otherwise take a personal interest in Cleary's commercial activities. So get the troops there on time. Or else. Or else what? You know. Full of charm, isn't he? Well, go and dig them out, Lance Corporal. Toute suite. So, that's what they mean by "chain of command", is it? Gather round, you blokes. A bit of news. (CABARET-STYLE MUSIC) (All sing) You wore a tulip A sweet yellow tulip And I wore a big, red rose When you caressed me 'Twas then heaven blessed me What a blessing no-one knows You made me cheery when you called me deary Was out where the bluegrass grows... 'Whizz Bangs', eh? Sound more like bloody drop shorts to me. ...and I wore that big, red rose... Roly's in the grip of the grape. Do him good. (Audience applauds and cheers) I wore a tunic A dirty, khaki tunic And you wore your civvy clothes We fought and bled at Loos while you were on the booze Booze that no-one here knows Around with the wenches while we were in the trenches Facing an angry foe You were a-slacking while we were attacking Up along the Pozieres road. (Audience applauds and cheers) Hello, boys. Hello, sailor! (All laugh) Have we got an entertainment-packed evening for you? MAN: Show us your muscles, then. (Man whistles) Not in front of the ladies. (All laugh) But before we start I have just been handed from Aussie the results of the conscription referendum. And I'm sure you all want to hear them. (Men yawn and laugh) Western Australia - yes. Victoria - yes. (Audience cheers enthusiastically) Queensland - no. Tasmania - yes. NSW - no. (Audience cheer) South Australia - no. Out of 2.4 million votes cast, the majority for no is 70,000. Now, what about that? ! (SILENCE) (All laugh and cheer) (GUNSHOT) (All laugh) Get him off! You get him off. Get him off! You get him off. Uh... to be at this gathering, um, here tonight, there's to be some, um, recitation. And who better to recitate at ya than your old mate Lance Corporal Cleary? (All cheer and laugh) A bit of Australian poetry. I'll put the right hat on. A bit of respect. Alright. Um... 'The Bastard From the Bush'. (All laugh) Heard it before, have you? As dust was slowly settling Over city, town and bush This joker come to see us He wanted to join the push Would you let a woman keep ya? Would you give up work for good? Would I let a woman keep me? Get him off! My oath I would. (All cheer) And now the 15th Brigade Football Team Chorus! (GUNSHOT) (CABARET-STYLE MUSIC) (All boo and jeer) Get off! What's this? What's this, a bloody poofter show, eh? Careful, that's Punchy Ellis. He put two blokes in hospital last game. That's the mug. Punchy Ellis, yeah! Isn't he an ugly mug? Punchy Ellis. Always reckoned you shaved your legs, mate! (All laugh) Hasn't he got an ugly mug, and an arse to match? Duck! Duck! Duck! MAN: Break it up! Break it up! Come on, get him. Go on! Ha! Glad you could make it. Let's go before the MPs arrive. Why can't all concerts be like this? I'll talk to Pat about it. SONG: Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parlez-vous Mademoiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous Mademoiselle from Armentieres She hasn't been kissed for 40 years Inky-pinky parlez-vous The men from Wagga and Gundagai Parlez-vous From Perth, the Towers, and Boggabri Parlez-vous Sydney City and Dandenong Will think of you as they battle along Inky-pinky parlez-vous. (JAUNTY MILITARY MUSIC) (MILITARY TATTOO PLAYS) (EXPLOSION) The great Somme Offensive had sputtered to a close in the last months of 1916. Patrol's still out, sir. It was now the new year, and the north European winter descended on the battlefield, a battlefield turned into a moonscape by a million shells. This desolate place marked where 300,000 British soldiers fell for the gain of a few miles. The guns were mostly silent now, except for an occasional burst of hate. The soldiers' energies were concentrated on battling those old foes - rain and cold. Few of us could ever forget the winter of 1916-17. Also buried here were illusions and false hopes for a quick end to the war. Two mighty armies faced each other over a few yards of muddy ground in a paralysing stalemate. And while generals in warm chateaux puzzled to find an answer front-line soldiers were united in a common misery. Old Fritz was just as badly off. (GUNFIRE) (TENSE MUSIC) They could have killed us. Well, you could have killed them. Yeah, but I didn't want to. There aren't many I want to kill, mate. Don't let the colonel hear you say that. Stupid! I was crazy to join up. Ah, we all were, Roly. (Voice wavers) I'm not any good at killing people. Hey! You're good enough, mate. I hate this war. I hate the mud, and the lice. The blokes being wounded and blown apart, killed. But there's my mates. The best. What I mean is that there's times even now when I've been so happy. I love the war. I wouldn't have missed it for quids. And that's got to be wrong, hasn't it, Marty? MAN: (Chuckles) Mother's boy, hey? Hey, Barrington? Mm-hm? I brought you a new chum. New second lieuy. (Laughs) Oh, my God. What's up? He's so clean! Lieutenant Armstrong's platoon? That's right. Take me to him, please. Be seeing you, digger. Yeah. Er, this way. (MARTIAL DRUMMING) G'day. Your suggestion, Sergeant? Yes, Mr Armstrong. I think if we can get through... What do you reckon I could charge for this, Bill? BILL: Oh, maybe 30 francs. What's the mark-up? A new officer, sir. 100%. This is Lieutenant Armstrong. Second Lieutenant Earnshaw reporting, sir. Glad to meet you, Mr Earnshaw. This is Sergeant McArthur. McARTHUR: Glad to have you with us. First time to the front, Mr Earnshaw? Yes, sir. You can forget the 'sir'. I think you had better show Mr Earnshaw around, Corporal. And put the head down. Er, better take a look at the trench maps, sir. Need any help? With what? That name. Earnshaw. He's that joker from Parliament. That windbag politician. Hey! That's right. The 'Would To God'er. That's him. "Now you are going forth to war. Would to God I could go with you." Yeah. "Only someone's got to stay and run the country. "Would to God it wasn't me." (Chuckles) Er, perhaps we should look at the trenches now, sir. That's my Dad, 'Would To God' Earnshaw. Did you hear me? Yes, I did. It's none of my business. Oh, yes, it is. Talk about me all you like but not about my father, you hear? And pass the word. Yeah, I'll do that. Meanwhile, we've got a war going on here. One moment, Corporal. Lance Corporal, what's happening? Not a lot. Let's have a look. I can see them! Well, of course you can. Did you think they weren't there? (BIRDS TWITTER) Get back to it. Who's on this thing? Huh? What? Send some bombs over on the trenches in the front. Now, sir, that's utterly ridiculous. You heard me. (Yawns) Oh, God. Fire. Fire. (Men exclaim in German) Look at the enemy, Lance Corporal. Well? Up a couple of yards. We'll give them four. Sir, you don't understand. The Germans... Four! And keep a good lookout. Fire. Dead on. Take cover! Look out! Get down! What the hell's going on, Flanagan? They want to play it rough, sir. We'll give them eight. Give them nothing. Not a bloody thing. What's going on, Mr Earnshaw? We were instructed at Officer Training to be aggressive, sir. You were, were you? Yes, sir. And if the enemy fires, we fire back double. Was ist denn los? What did he say, Kaiser? He wants to know what's going on. Tell him we are very sorry but we have a new officer that didn't know the rules. Entschuldigung. Es tut uns leid, aber wir haben einen neuen Offizier und er kennt sich noch nicht aus. This way, Mr Earnshaw. Now, this is not the Officer's Training School, Mr Earnshaw. This is the real war! We and Fritz have an arrangement. NOBOD Y, Mr Earnshaw, nobody fires before 16:30 hours. Now, for the past five months, we have been shot at every hour that God sends. Now we get shot at by arrangement, Mr Earnshaw. We rather like it that way. We intend to keep it that way! Now we can all get some sleep around here, eh? Sorry, sir. Yeah, well. It's alright, Mr Earnshaw, you weren't to know. But just take it easy. There's a lot of Germans left. As you were. He's going to learn the hard way, eh? Don't worry. He'll get to know the ropes. (KNOCK AT DOOR) George? Oh. You're busy. No, no. Please stay. You're a most welcome interruption. Not much Christian comfort here. What do you mean? Oh, er, just some rather surprising responses to the letter I wrote to the paper. Not particularly savoury reading. Never mind about that. How have things been with you? Well, we've been in the city. Rupert doing his war work. Now we're home for a while. I've missed you, Thea. I promised myself I wouldn't say that. What's that? Er, it's the coward's feather. I've heard of these but I've never actually seen one. Oh. Have you had others? Yes. 1916 was a good year. 1917 promises to be even better. Oh, don't joke about it, George. I wish I could. I'm front-page news in the Catholic AND the radical journals. Yes, I've read about it. "Anglican Priest Speaks Out Against Conscription." "The voice of reason in a sea of bigotry." You're quite a celebrity. The Archbishop calls it notoriety. You're ruining your career, George. Why? Because the rest of the Church of England is FOR the war and I believe that MY church should be more than just Empire loyalists at prayer. Because... because I believe in the Sermon on the Mount. Because... Because I'm naive, because... I don't know. George. Most of all because this second conscription campaign has has divided the country. It's unleashed the bigotry and the sectarianism that I thought we left behind us in the Old World. I mean, what will become of the ideals of the new Australia - dignity, equality for all? George. They've all gone. What do you see, Pud? Nothing. Hmpf! What do you mean, 'nothing'? They've all gone. Is it over? For God's sake, Pudden. Keep your head down! See anything? Nup. He's right. Sergeant, inform battalion I'm sending a patrol out. Sir. (DISTANT RUMBLING) See. I told you there was no-one. Shut up! Hang about. Get back. Now, don't touch anything, alright? Thank God Cleary's not here. Anyone home? (RATS SQUEAL) Well? Nup. Nothing but the rats. Come on, let's get out of here. Suits me, mate. Come on. Move! CLEARY: Two of us and her by herself. (All laugh) How did you know it was my birthday? You told the bloke when you joined up, Pud. Did I? Yeah. Don't worry about it. We've got two reasons to celebrate. First time out of the line for months and your birthday. Ha. What are going to do? Ooh! Hey, that's a big surprise. Yeah, that's sounds alright. MAN: Aussie! Shh! Hey! Aussie, here! Quick! Down here. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) FLANAGAN: Hey! MAN: Oh! HEY! Ah! AH! Hey. Hey. Hey. OFFICER: What do we have here then? Nosy parkers? Mind your own business or you'll get some of the same. What was he doing, robbing the Bank of England? I asked the way to the knocking shop. He tried to gain entrance to a blue light house. PUDDEN: What's a blue light mean? Officer's knock shop. Red light's for the troops. Now, hop it. Quick. Listen, why don't we take him back to camp with us? No. We're going to make a few examples of you Australians. You blokes are going to start a riot. That'll be enough, laddie, or I'll nick you too. Now, listen... No mate. No. No, we don't want any trouble. I'll go quietly. Better get them out of sight. (SNEAKY MUSIC) Now we're really in for it. Are you alright, mate? Yeah. Go, nick off. Keep your head down! What about us, then? I reckon we better lay low too. Good idea. Hey. Let's not forget what we came for. Ha, ha. Come on, birthday boy. (French accent) I'm sorry, you cannot come in here. Oh, that's a shame. Oh! Well, perhaps. Hey, this place is alright. MADAM: Oh! Hey Pud. Get this into you, mate. PUDDEN: Ta. I think perhaps we can use the private room. Oh, this stuff tickles your nose, Pat. MADAM: Mademoiselle Fifi. Mademoiselle Collette and Mademoiselle Claudine. Are they all for me, Pat? Yeah. Happy birthday, Pud. (Chuckles) (ROMANTIC FRENCH ACCORDION MUSIC) G'day. (RUMBLING) What's up? FLANAGAN: Jesus! (FOREBODING MUSIC) What in heaven's name is that? It's called the Hindenburg line. You're right. The Germans didn't retreat. They withdrew. Yeah. We'll never take that. Never. Not fighting the way our generals do. Bill, my old mate. You should have more confidence. Of course we'll take it. Tomorrow. Head-on like a bull at a gate. You're not serious. I heard the 4th Division will get first go, and just to make it more exciting there'll be no artillery barrage beforehand. You must be joking. They're going to surprise them. Just infantry and tanks. Tanks? Haven't seen any of them around here. Anyway, the bloody things haven't worked yet. Neither have head-on infantry assaults but that doesn't seem to worry old General Gough. It's Pozieres all over again. Oh, no, mate. Pozieres was just slaughter. This lot's... This lot's premeditated murder. (GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS) See anything? The 4th are trying to pull out, but Fritz has the whole area covered by fire. Another bloody stuff-up. Righto. Five minute warning to move. Get your gear on. Bloody heads. Yeah. Too right. We've been in the line nine months now. Hey, there's a rumour going round that the Frogs are telling their officers to nick off. At gunpoint, if necessary. Shut up, Dingo. That's not what I had in mind. Yeah? What DID you have in mind, Corporal? Nothing. Come on, man. Out with it. In front of the platoon. Look, none of us mind the risk. It's just the stupidity and the bloody waste! I see. You may all have your own opinions on the higher direction of this war. I can't stop that. But they will not interfere with your duty as soldiers or Australians. Now, in a few weeks, it will be Anzac Day. Two years since this battalion stepped ashore against all odds on Gallipoli. There's scores of dead mates from this platoon who thought that worth fighting for. Mateship. That's what's held the AIF together throughout this BLOOD Y war. Now there's 10,000 of our mates in another division going through bloody hell just over there. I'll do what I can to help them and, by God, you're coming with me! Alright, now that that's out of the way, here's what we're going to do. We're going out to gather all the 4th Division wounded we can from no-man's-land. (GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS INTENSIFY) Here! (Men yell) MAN: You'll be right. ARMSTRONG: Sergeant, up front. Flanagan, cover. Right! Can't move? My knee. MAN: More field dressings over here. We had it won. We got in but then, no ammo, no bombs. MAN: Somebody help me with this man! You'll be right now we're here. Stretcher! What are our orders, sir? The Lewis... The Lewis gun will... The Lewis gun will cover our withdrawal. Tommy. Tommy! Stretcher! Lhr seid umgeringt. Ergebt euch! Get nicked! (Men yell) (GUNFIRE INTENSIFIES) It's a bastard of a war but it has its moments, doesn't it? Oh! By Jeez, they keep coming, eh? Just like old Johnny Turk. We'll just keep them out of bombing range. We'll be sweet. Mac? MAC! Look for the others. MAN: We're moving back! Number two's gone. Come on, I'll get you back. Piss off, Flanagan! Mac! I'll put you on a charge! You could never make it stick, now come on. I knew it was going to be today. Get Bluey out of here while you still can. Go on. Piss off, you sentimental prick! Thank Christ you didn't change, McArthur. Come on, mate. (McArthur fires machine gun) Bugger. Number two's gone west, sir. Bluey's alright, I think. McArthur's hurt bad. He won't be moved. I'll take a look. Kaiser, you're wasting your time. Stretcher-bearers! I'm covering you, Kaiser! (BANG! ) (CONSTANT GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS) Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Arggh! Get up, Pudden. We're leaving. No! No! No! Get up, for the love of God! No! No! No! Pudden! Flanagan, cover Kaiser on the way in. All accounted for, sir. Well, Pudden - I haven't seen him. He's out. I saw him run over that way. For God's sake, let's go, then! (ARTILLERY EXPLOSIONS) Trying to write a recommendation for Tom McArthur. Words just... (Sighs) Here, have some of this. Please. What's that? (Chuckles) Black Label at least, if I know Pat. What would I do without you all? (Sighs and chuckles) It's the other way round, Harry. You got us through, minimum casualties. It's all madness, mate. Why don't we just pack up and march home? (Chuckles) That's what I've heard some of the French have done, but then, they've always prided themselves on their logic. But it's not an Anglo-Celtic trait. What, then? Ah, you said it before - too many dead mates. Is that sufficient reason to go on killing young Germans just like us? (Sighs) If you'd asked me that back in 1913 when I was still at uni, I would have had 10,000 answers. And now? None. Oh, come on. Oh, a faint glimmer of reason, then. Er, America's now on the same side as Britain and France, all the great democracies. Must be something, I suppose. That's small comfort. Oh, not to mention the other little ones - Canada, New Zealand, Australia. You expect to survive, Martin? No. Do you? No. You know, just before the war, I won a bursary to take geography at university. Oh, yeah. Great initiation here, eh? (Chuckles) Do you know that Australia is two-thirds desert? Well, no, the point is that in such an unforgiving country like ours, we're going to need the very best resilient people. So? Well, don't you see? They're the ones being shot out here. (REFLECTIVE MUSIC) (RATS SQUEAK) I hate the bloody fat ones. I know what they've been eating. Oh, my God. Hey, come on, Harry! It's not original. An American Civil War general said it before. Still, it can't be all bad. I mean, that bastard Gough ordered the attack today. Why, I bet he's having the time of his little life, with ours. (Chuckles) Yeah. (Chuckles) Yep. Well, here's to that I'm still alive, and to hell with you, Barry. (Chuckles) (Sighs) (Sings) The bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling For you but not for me (Both sing) Oh, the angels all go sing-a-ling-a-ling For you but not for me Oh, death, where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling? Skipper OK? Yeah, Doc Barrington's in attendance. Maybe I should send him a bill. After all, it's my medication. You mean 'was'. Oh, mate, they should make you a general. (Chuckles) (Sighs) I'm sorry, Thea. That's alright, George. I sometimes find myself going through the motions, and what's the point? Well, we all feel like that sometimes. What good's it done to the thousands of mothers who've prayed in vain? Oh! The newspaper was filled with the Hindenburg battle. "Heroic attacks by Canadians and Australians." After three years, one knows that heroic is just another word for heavy casualties. That's when my imagination gets hold of me. Martin wasn't in the last attack. He's written to you again? He hardly ever writes to me. Yes, he has written to me again, but you wouldn't want to read those letters, Thea. In them, he... well, he tells the truth about the war. It's his way of unburdening himself. How is he? Oh, he's remarkably stable, considering the circumstances. Circumstances which, a few years ago, would have taken an ordinary man to the brink of insanity. How can they bear it? They depend upon one another. They have a fierce brotherhood, in which each sustains the other. It's something approaching the Christian ideal. Ironical, isn't it, that war should produce that? BILL: "We can't sit here," she said, "because it prickles." I swear to God, I hadn't gone near her by then. (All chuckle) Hello, boys. Stay seated, lads. Just a few announcements. Oh, crikey, skip. No, we are not going back on the line, Dingo. Even the powers that be feel nine months straight is enough. They have declared leave for the whole battalion - Blighty leave. ALL: Hooray! Hooray! Beer and English women, eh? (All laugh) Right, lads, promotion list. Not this time, Paddy. The colonel has recommended that Corporal Barrington be commissioned in the field. Oh, Marty! Oh! MAN: Good on you, Marty! Until the commission comes through, you'll be Acting Platoon Sergeant. Colonel Barrington. Officer Barrington, eh? Lance Corporal Flanagan will go to Corporal. Ah, you're slacking off, Flanagan. Ooooh, Flanagan! Private Schmidt will go to Lance Corporal. On you, Kaiser. Oooh, Kaiser! There was another name on the promotions list, but it was withdrawn at the man's request. It's a pity. We need all the experienced NCOs we can get. Lastly, I have the great pleasure and honour of announcing the award of the Military Medal to Lance Corporal Schmidt for his work on the Hindenburg line. (Men cheer) Kaiser Bill, again! (Applauds) Name out of a hat, that one. Your mum'll be proud of you, Kaiser. Sir? It's about Pudden Parsons. I've a report he's been seen on the old Somme battlefield. Isn't that where those bludgers... Where the organised groups of deserters are believed to hang out. The colonel's agreed if we find him, he'll be charged with the lesser absence without leave, not desertion in the face of the enemy. A month in the jug rather than life? Exactly, Flanagan. Now, I want you to take a party out and find him. They say these deserters are a pretty desperate lot, so you'll go fully armed. Suits me, sir. I'd love a crack at those mongrel... Just bring Pudden back as your first priority, Flanagan. Yes, sir. Now, report to Company HQ in 30 minutes for details and good luck. Mr Armstrong, er, what about you, sir? Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I've been promoted to Captain, and will take charge of the company. Good on you, skip! That's the way, sir! Thanks, Bill. Cheers, lads. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Wait! I might have known. What's the matter - don't you reckon I can handle it? I just wanted to see the ruthless streak at work. Keep moving. (MUSIC REACHES CRESCENDO) (English accent) That's far enough for the moment, thank you, gentlemen, unless you'd rather we started shooting. Who's in charge? Well, well, the sergeant AND the corporal. How nice of you to drop in, but I'm afraid you're a little off course. The Germans are over that way. We're a... peaceable lot here, as long as we're left alone. You've got one of our blokes. We want him back. Come, come, Corporal, that's no way to speak to a - what am I this week? A major. High time I was a colonel, don't you think? High time you were in the jug, you bludger. You're alive. Try to be more polite, you may stay that way. Is this the lot of you? So few. You have no chance, no chance at all. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) See what I mean? What's your name? Flanagan. What's yours? Edward Kelly. I see we share a common heritage, but you missed out on the charm. I missed out on lots of things, but going back on my word wasn't one of them. This discussion is becoming tiresome. Go back to your silly European civil war, for that's all it is. If they insist on wiping each other out, it's no business of Australians. Now, listen, mate... (Sighs) Surely you can see that peace dictated by Germany would be a disaster for Australia too. Well, the sergeant has a voice. As to the question, it's highly theoretical, therefore boring. Oh, and don't appeal to my altruism. I lost it on the Somme. Nevertheless, if they win, they wouldn't take kindly to your sort. We've been studying practical survival. We're very good at it. Now, go. Not without Pudden. (Cocks gun) Goodbye. You'll have to shoot us first. Even then, we'll take a couple of you with us. After that, they'll send out the battalion. Things could get messy. You really care about Pudden, don't you? He's our mate, and he needs looking after. Well, ask him. Come out, Pudden. Martin? Your friends - or so they say. Do you want to go back to them, to the war? Listen, Mr Kelly, you were real good to me when I wasn't feeling well, but... I really miss them. (Sighs) Idealism is the curse of the age. Here in Europe, that can be lethal. On your way. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Come on, mate. Here, Roly, give us a hand. I remember an Australian actor named Edward Kelly. One's public is everywhere. He used to play English gentlemen roles Still does, old boy. Still does. (Grunts) Oh. Um, they're not borrowed, are they? No, unfortunately, they're quite, quite genuine. So, it's official, now? What is? That you're a gentleman, by act of Parliament. Thank you very much. Actually, er, I only did it to gain access to the nurses' mess. Mm-hm. Have you heard we're getting Blighty leave? Yes. I don't suppose you could arrange some? No chance. Damn. But I'll tell you little secret. Hmm? I'm going to be in London next week, on a gas treatment course at St Thomas's hospital. You won't tell anyone, will you? (Chuckles) (NEWSREEL WINDS) (BELLS RING REPEATEDLY) (English accent) Remember what I told you. I haven't forgotten. No ladies. I promise. My sister knows you're coming. She'll meet you. Brighton's nice this time of year, and she's a great cook. Real home from home for you. Thanks, Bill. I'll never forget it. You'll be in clover, son. She's wanted for ages to meet my Australian mates. I couldn't send her any of this lot. You're a real mate. Oh, only thing is is these three little girls of hers, regular terrors, they were. I don't mind. I got a kid sister. She doesn't bother me. Oh, that's alright, then. Off you go and enjoy yourself. Oh, and remember what I told you - if you feel the urge coming on, go and paddle in the sea instead. Don't worry, Bluey, she's got a nice tall friend who's dying to meet you. See you, Bill. Ow! (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) It's the blind leading the dumb. (lmitates English accent) I'm off to my father's tailor for a uniform. Oh. See you, guys. Look after yourselves. (Chuckles) Bill. See you. What are you grinning at? Nothing. It looks like it. What's up, man? You're on leave. Leave? Where do I go on leave in London with a name like Wilhelm Schmidt? Appledore Farm, Chislehurst, Kent - that's where you go. Chislehurst? I don't know Chislehurst. You will when we get there. It's where my mum lives, innit? Do you think I'd be welcome? Any mate of mine'll be welcome, especially one like you that's house-trained, Bill. Thanks, mate. MAN: Look at that. MAN: Hmm. 8th Battalion. (Chuckles) Martin Barrington! Mr Murdoch. How have you been since Gallipoli? Well, thanks. And how's my gallant brother? Oh, he's coming over next week. Here. Thank you. I didn't know you were a member. My father put me up. When this war's over, we'll get back to real soldiering. What's up with those two? Some people don't like the idea of officers being promoted from the ranks. Ah. Well, it works for us, but then, we're getting shot at, aren't we? What'll it be? Er, scotch and soda. Make that two, please. Staff. Mmm. Too thick to be anything else. Alright, let's have it. (Chuckles) I tend to be rather a bore about it. You won't bore me. Very well. Our men are magnificent, and in my opinion, our NCOs and junior officers are the best there are. They have to be... Thank you. Go on. ...because time and again, they're asked to lead their men into one bloody shambles after another, watch them get blown to bits or blown to bits themselves. But they keep doing it. Because they keep doing it, they get the lion's share of every hair-brain thrust some mad general dreams up as this week's war-winning battle. We'd be better off if we lost one. They'd pull us out of the line. Believe me, Mr Murdoch, you can't break the stalemate in France by pitting flesh and blood against machine guns, despite what higher command says, and no-one's seemed to come up with a better way. What about morale? Still good, so far, but it's not an inexhaustible resource. I mean, it can't be, not if they keep making us go on like this. It's getting to the point where we'll end up fighting the staff. Martin, er... (Sighs) I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me. There's some men I must see. I'm obliged to you, Martin. Now, you enjoy your leave, and I'll see you again. 'Bye. Goodbye. (POIGNANT MUSIC) (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in, Keith. Good evening, Prime Minister. Good of you to be available at such short notice. Now, you know Hankey, of course. Mmm. Er, General Wilson, Liaison with the French Command, Keith Murdoch. General. Mr Murdoch. Make yourself at home. There's strong drink, if the other two haven't disposed of it. No, thank you, sir. Well, then, I would like to start these proceedings with some pleasantries about such things as the weather, but, er, these days, even the weather has sinister overtones affecting young men's lives, so I'll come straight to the point. I would like the Australian Prime Minister to join me in the War Cabinet as soon as possible. Can he do it? Not for some months, I'm afraid, Prime Minister. He's determined to push the second conscription referendum through. It won't be an easy task. Because of your losses on the Western Front? There are some Australians who are strongly opposed to conscripts sharing the burden that volunteers have endured. Responsible opinion hopes he'll be successful in changing minds. Pity, pity. Our Commander-ln-Chief is deeply entrenched as a... as... WILSON: The Germans in the Hindenburg line. Yes, unfortunately. Haig wants another offensive? Another murderous frontal attack, like the Somme last year. No, it's Ypres, this time, where the Germans MUST fight. The Germans fight everywhere. Haig must be stopped. Another one of his victories, and there will be no young men left. To be fair, he has good strategic grounds. Even old Marshal Foch has said that an offensive at Ypres would be like a duck's march through a swamp. But he wouldn't say that today. The French Army has suffered serious mutinies. Some 61 divisions refuse to attack. Their generals are even worse than ours. So far, it's the best kept secret of the war. The French are pressing for a British attack, anywhere, lest the Germans realise they can win the war at a stroke on the French front. The Americans are due in any moment, surely. Oh, the Americans have to talk about it anymore. Should've known this wasn't gonna work. Foreigners never finish the job. Oh, please, if Bob hadn't shown up, I'd be your stepdaddy right now. B-7. Miss. Oh, man, how do I keep missing you? It's 'cause I don't have any boats on there. What's that noise? It's my dad's heart monitor. Where's your mom? She's with him. Oh, take off the beeper! Other people live here! He was brought in at 09:00 and they figured he was responsible for setting off a nuke on U.S. soil. NORAD picked up a hotspot in the Alaskan mountains just outside of Fairbanks. They contacted the warship Sumanza, stationed in the Bearing Strait. Commander Drew Stevens dispatches troops to the area to observe phase one terrorist protocol. Expect the worst. Whatever happened was to be considered an act of war against the United States. That's when they called me. And in the hours that followed I learned things that were going to change the way we live forever. Don't move! There's somebody at the door. Oh, God ... You look like shit, son. Why don't you have a seat, make yourself comfortable? Want to tell me your name? I've already told you people. I'm Doctor Peter Lang. I need to report to Major Harrison of Charlie Squadron Delta. I don't have much time. You a military man, Lang? Sort of. Sort of. That's funny. I've been in military most of my adult life and I've never met a single person who was "sort of" in the military. You're either in or you're out, don't you think? So a pretty straight forward answer I'm looking for here. So, I'm gonna ask you again. Are you in the military? I can't talk to anybody in this building. I'm not authorized to. Call Harrison, and he'll understand the urgency of the situation. I got a pretty good handle on the situation. Two hours ago, somebody detonated a nuclear device on U.S. soil and you're the prime suspect. That's either an act of war or that's terrorism but either way you're going to answer any question I ask you. So, why don't we start this again? Are you a military man, Lang? I need to report to Harrison, the Joint Chiefs or the President. I'm not authorized to talk to you and I won't. If you get Harrison, you might have a chance to save the world. Save the world. That sounds like a threat to me. You keep talking about this Harrison ... right? We've been looking for him since you've mentioned his name. And guess what? There is no Harrison. The President and the Joint Chiefs don't have the foggiest idea who Peter Lang is nor do they have any interest in talking to terrorists. I suggest that you put me at the top of your priority list and do it pretty quick cause things are about to get ugly around here. Why don't we try this again? Who do you work for, Peter? That kind of smarts, doesn't it? Most fellows start belleding from the ears, but you took this pretty good. - You don't look so bad. - I have ... top information, and you're treating me like a terrorist. I'm doing that 'cause this is a matter of national security. A lot of people out there got a lot of questions and I've been given authorization to use whatever means necessary to get answers to those questions. I suggest you start telling me what you know now or we're going to go through this over and over again. I can't. I love these things. 400,000 volts running off two nine volts batteries. This sort of torture used to be sloppy. Buckets, sponges, big cables. It just wasn't safe. Nowadays, I can carry 400,000 volts in my hip pocket. Pretty effective, wouldn't you say? I can't tell you what you want to hear. You have to trust me. It's for your own safety. You're going to tell me what I want to know. Why don't we keep is simple, all right? Tell me how your day started. - Hi, honey. - Hi, Peter. A phone call would've been nice. You know how I feel about phones. Baby, go wait in your room, OK? Bye, Peter. See you, Kimie. There's been an incident in the lab. - Is everybody OK? - We don't know. I need to get in. I need to find out and I need your help. Peter, I ... An officer will look after Kimie. It won't be long. OK. Give me five minutes. Don't worry. I'll be back before you know it. - I love you. - I love you too. Bye, mom. - OK. Fill me in. - I will in the truck. Well ... at 2:13, Fairbanks HQ received some sort of garbled transmission. A breach of bio- containment six. Two minutes later, somebody on the inside initiated a full lock- down. Power's off. Interlock's sealed. All communications to the outside world were served from the inside. Look, I ... - I called Harrison. - Oh, Jesus. It could be any number of things. Chemical, or bio, or nuclear. Whatever it is, we're gonna need help. There're 14 people down there, and the clock is ticking. You're right. We're going to need Harrison. We're going to go in with a small combat team. Technical experts. Harrison's very best. Highest possible clearances, just in case. OK. If we have to move in, we move in. But this team of experts they only the best, right? Right. Come to me. Don't even think about it. I'm on the clock, honey. Don't you think this is more important than the clock? You're killing me. Sergeant Trainer. DCS tactical briefing in 10 minutes, Trainer. Trainer? Did I catch you at a bad time? No, sir. I'm just about ... to clear my weapon. We have a situation. Get O'Brien. You're going in tonight. Affirmative, sir. We're going in. Why don't you get whoever is on the phone to call you back? Trish? Daddy? I'm toast. You ... Trainer? I'm Hall. Communications. - Good to meet you, Hall. - Good to meet you, sir. - You new on the base? - Yes, sir. - First time in Alaska? - First. I like it though. It's cold. Trying to get used to the daylight. Never seems to get dark. Having trouble sleeping, sir. I've been here for two summers and I still can't get used to it. - And don't call me "sir". - Yes, sir ... OK. What have you heard about this mission? We're being sent there 'cause you banged the General's daughter. - Jesus Christ! - What? Bad news travels fast. You know kids. No. You see she had her 22nd birthday last week. Whatever you say, sir. Hear anything else? It looks that we're going to be accompanied by Major Ross and what's-her-dick? Get my volley? - Ross ... - Sir? I wonder why they'd send a Major on a mission like this. Can't say, sir. Haven't met the man myself ... but O'Brien ... she really drove our regiment into the ground in Iraq. She's a tough mother for a hole, let me tell you. That's what I heard ... But why would a half- decent looking chick like O'Brien ... want to be an officer? Everybody knows any chick that tough has to be a lesbo. She's get in the army to get the Colonel's daughter, probably. Sir ... Ma'am! When you finished bonding, re- join the rest of the army. Full mission breaking in two. - Yes, ma'am. - Sarge ... you need a larger weapon. Welcome to Alaska, Hall. Thank you, gentlemen. 'Ten- hut! All right, people, at ease. This mission is black. No medals, no rewards, no lucrative book deals. Our target destination is Vectol Bio - Research laboratories ... outside Fairbanks, Alaska. Although it is a civilian facility, it is under contract to Uncle Sam ... and my responsibility. Dr. Cole ... Captain O'Brien, is our best in bio- chem ... Sergeant Hall, is our communications specialist ... Trainer, weapons and explosives, lastly ... Major Ross, our counter- terrorism expert. Dr. Cole? Three hours ago, someone at our lab initiated an emergency lock- down. We've had no communication since. There're 14 researchers trapped down there. We need to get them out. Only 23 people outside this room know about those labs. Of those 23 only a handful are privy to the work they do. Although this is classified, we'll give you what we can. - Dr. Cole? - Dr. Lang ... head of the Bio - Weapons Counter Measures at Vectol. Vectol labs are located in an abandoned copper mine ... 500 feet below the surface. It's been retrofitted as a high- tech bio- chemical facility. Access is through a single air lock and elevator. There are four levels: research, weapons, chemical, living quarters. Below that is an emergency air lock. Once you're in, nothing gets out. There's been only one other breach of this facility two years ago. A lab tech accidentally spilled a thimble- full of nerve gas. A thimble- full. He died ninety seconds later. It took us three months to clean out that isolation lab. We are dealing with a full isolation lock- down. Trainer? Why us? Dr. Lang? Vectol Labs do a multitude of sins. Chemical, bio, nuclear toxins. Stuff we have down there makes Ebola look like the common cold. It's possible terrorists breached the facility. We need to find out. Don't we have any other intelligence on this? Latest satellite re- con flight shows all is clear. Perimeter secure. This is avery sensitive situation. Fewer people envolved, the better, that's why I'm sending the best. I'm a scientist, but I'm also a former Army Captain. Once inside, all of you answer directly to me. Trainer? People? - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Good. These are not your standard suits. They're made from Kevlar Purine fiber. Think of them as a2nd skin. Your atmosphere gauge is at the wrist. Green is for good air, yellow for questionable ... and if it's red and you've just breathed it, you've died. This is for your oxygen. You have about one hour's worth. What are these syringes for, doctor? Excuse me. If one of you become contaminated ... remove the hypodermic from the pouch ... and then plunge it directly in the neck ... as deep as ... Don't do that. ...as possible. - Avoid severing the carotid artery. - I'll do that. The needle releases a neuro- toxin. It would save your life and get you to treatment as quickly as possible. And what if we don't get stuck? What happens then? That depends on which toxin you've been infected with ... but within 10 seconds your throat constricts. You can't breath. Your esophagus becomes brittle and it dissolves. Your organs turn to jelly as your molecular structure is collapsing. But after that, you should mercifully black out. I get the picture. Have either one of you tried ... this needle? Yeah. Dr. Cole has. What happened? Gear up. We move out in ten. Any other questions? Dismissed. I think she likes me, O'Brien. What are you talking about? She's a grown- up. I should try that. Colonel! Major. Permission to speak freely, sir. Go ahead. I'm not comfortable taking my orders from these scientists. You take your orders from me. Follow Cole and Lang to the letter. Yes, sir, but babysitting civilians is ... Cole can take care of herself. It's Lang I need you to cover. He works for me. His project is classified ... has top priority on the Pentagon. Cole doesn't know about it. - She thinks she's in command. - Work with her all the way. If it's viral or chemical, she's in charge. It it's terrorist, you take command. Your priority is make sure Lang gets his research out. My team has the highest security clearance. I need to know what's going on down there. This is a matter of national security. Nobody can know about it. When it comes to biologicals, even the President is expendable. Yes, sir. Lang is the priority. If I'm a terrorist, what's my primary target down there? There's enough plutonium in that mountain to satisfy a small army. Terrorists or not, we're going to find our people okay down there. Just hope my staff are safe. With this lock- down there's a chance the air's been contaminated. Keep your helmets on and breathe easy. And conserve your air as long as possible. You got that? Cole ... if we do encounter terrorists, stand down and let my team handle this. Your team? Your team will do what I say. This is a chemical lab. Nobody does anything without my approval. You got that, Major? Trainer, hold up a sec. - I've got a bad feeling about this. - You're just scared. That's not what I meant. Chemical weapons, possible terrorists ... small crew, civilian in charge ... We're going in there and no one is telling us anything about it. How many times have you and I been down this road before? You watch my back, I'll watch yours all right. - I hate working with civilians. - You wanted Delta. Deal with it. Lang. What? The minute you know how to get out of there, you let me know. I don't need my team staying in this tunnel any longer than they have to. I'll recommend immediate e- vac as soon as I get what I need. And, Major, our relationship stays confidential. That's what I hear. Peter, check the intercom, see if anyone responds. No, doc, not a good idea. If they're terrorists you don't want to give away our position, right? Good point. Let's keep the chatter to a minimum, OK? Jesus, Lang! Will you back the fuck up? Holster that weapon. - This isn't right. - What's your concern, Cole? The reading. There's something in the air but I don't know what it is. What's with this water? I have no idea. I've never seen anything like this. - Hey, Ross. - What have you got? Looks like a gold tooth. - That's a little more than unusual. - Got some slime all over it. What's the slime like? Is it toxic? I don't think so. Cole, you should take a look at it. Maybe the sprinkler system broke here. It's not HO or retardant. Cole ... what do you think? - Major! - Hall. Got a Number 45 here ... emptied the clip. What the hell they shooting at? No matter, but stay Sharp so it doesn't end up shooting at you. I found a pacemaker. It's still beating. Jesus! This is creepy. We need to get to work. Hall, Trainer and O'Brien ... restore communications and power. It's through these doors. It's down one level. Keep to the right. It's at the end of the hall. After that, sweep level 3. It's the living quarters. Wait. You want us to split up? Ross, what do we do? You have your orders. Report if you see anyone. RCB will be level 2. Containments labs. We'll meet there. - How many people we looking for? - Fourteen. You heard the lady, let's move out. I think we should look for the guy with the pacemaker. Just my luck, I'm red shit, baby. This way. Dr. Lang, this isn't a picnic. Let's move. - This is worse than we thought. - You recognize it. It's got the molecular structure of human DNA. - Doctors? What is this stuff? - We're not sure just yet. Major, I wouldn't stand under there if I were you. Where the hell is everybody? I don't know. Trainer ... ever notice our missions have become a little more hazardous? What are you talking about? Look around you. We're in a factory full of biological weapons. So, what's that got to do with me? She's jailbait and she's the Colonel's daughter. Would you put a pipe in it? She's not jailbait, Captain. She looks at least 19 or 10. That's my man, Hall. She ain't no child. You're just jealous, O'Brien. Come on, O'Brien, who you kidding? Wouldn't you take a run at her if you had a chance? Careful, Hall, or I'm going to take a run at you. Want to get you guys a room? Hall's not my type, Trainer. - He thinks I'm a lesbo. - I'm OK with lesbos. Just kidding. It's gone. What? No, that's impossible. - What's gone? - I can't talk about it with you. I don't give a damn about your secret weapons. I'll tell you what you need to know when you need to know it. - Are my people in any danger? - Not more than the rest of us. - That's not an answer. - Give us a moment, Major. One of our experiments has gone missing. We need to find it. - Ross. Copy? - Go ahead, Captain. Auxiliary power was up in the lab level only. The generator doesn't work. Hall can't get any more power of it. Good work. We've completed the sweep of the living quarters. Not a soul, sir. Proceed to communications. Try to raise Harrison. And Captain ... watch your back. Anything on your end, sir? One of the doctor's experiments has gone missing. - What kind of an experiment? - They're both tight lipped. Until I know more, assume we're still dealing with terrorists. Exercise extreme caution and report back every 10 minutes. Understood. It's not just a walk in the park. Not today. If I can squeeze any more out of them I'll contact you. Roger that. - Reporting back in 10. - In 10 minutes. Missing experiment. - Doesn't sound too good. - Not in this place, it ain't. Stay Sharp. We got a job to do. What the hell happened here? You fix this up, Hall? Raise topside? I could raise Mars if I had to, but ... it's probably easier to ... jerry- rig the up- line and get cell communications working. This is creepy. Slime covering everything. Like something out of the Blob. - Holy shit, Hall, that's it. - What? The doctor's experiments is probably just like the Blob. It's loose and it's sliming up everything in its path ... devouring everything it can. You know what? We're dessert. - You're not funny. - What are you talking about? You're not funny, man. - You see that? - Yeah, right. - Let's focus. - I'm serious. I saw some guy. - I swear! - Hall. - Jesus! - You saw someone? - I think. - Hall, raise topside. Let's go. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. Get in there. Get communications up. I'll check the door. All right. Let's hope the containment lab remains secure. Is it possible somebody moved it? It's possible, but unlikely. It takes a team of 8 to move it. If it had been moved, we would have known. - What about the plutonium? - It is all accounted for, Major ... but right now it's the least of our worries. The air is clean. Cole, check the computer data. See if somebody's moved it. I'll check bio- containment 6. Major Ross, you watch her back. Major Ross, external com is up and operating, sir. Good work, Trainer. O'Brien, continue to sweep, report if you find anyone. Roger. I'll continue. Command, alpha team reporting. This is Harrison. Report. Auxiliary power and communications restored, sir. We have control of the main lab. Still no sign of the staffers. We do however have a missing experiment. We're going to look for it and any sign of terrorists. - Keep me posted. You did this to me. Stay here. Watch my back. Jesus Christ! Is that you, Sara? What the hell happened? It got out. We didn't stand a chance. Nobody's going to be able to stop it. It's under my skin, Peter. It's under my goddamn skin! - Sara, no! - Look what you've done to me. Radiation is the only way to kill it. What happened? - I need to kill us all. - For Christ's sakes, don't do that! It's inside me. I can feel it. Inside me. - I can feel it. - lf you're gonna kill us all, stop! No! Please, don't make me do this. Just stop. Sara, I'm so sorry. Cole, no! Cole, you just executed a civilian. She was no longer human. Then what was she? Lang, why didn't you try to help her? She was infected. - Infected with what? - There are infectious agents here. Not good enough, doctor. The radiation would've gone critical. I did what I had to do. I want answers. I need to know now! What are we up against? There are no terrorists, are there? We can't be certain. I reckon that we leave now. That's the first sensible thing either of you have said all day. We're not leaving until we figure out the fate of our staff. You just saw what happened to our staff. Trainer, give me a situation report. Nothing down here but slime, sir. Other than that, all seems clear. Return to the lab. We're getting out of here. If you meet anyone, assume that they're hostile. Sergeant, keep your suits on at all times. - Hostile, sir? - We just met one of the staffers. It wasn't pretty. She was infected with something. - It's been secured. - Secured, sir? - Permanently. - Understood. Meet back at the lab. - Report anything suspicious. - Copy that. This whole place is suspicious. Command, this is alpha team. One second. Harrison. Report. The situation isn't good. We can confirm contamination. Cole, you there? - Yes, sir. - Situation? The facility has been breached and the PB3 is missing. Colonel ... I suggest that we brief Ross on the Intel that we have on PB3. Our chances of surviving through this mission will be greater. Fill him in my full authorization. Yes, sir. We first heard about it after Chernobyl. Soviets discovered an alien microbe on a meteorite that crashed in Siberia in the 10's. They called it PB3 to honor the third session of the Politburo ... or something like that. Once the microbe was separated it reproduced at an alarming rate. Their scientists attempted to clone it. No dice. In the end, it took a 10-megaton nuke and 10,000 lives to put that genie back in the bottle. After the wall collapsed, Uncle Sam took all responsibility and brought it to us. Government hired Vectol to study the military potential and applications of PB3 to see how to counter it. As a liquid, it had this ... intelligence. It could think, learn. Imagine, a single alien life from the size of a drop of water that we could train to kill whatever we wanted it to. A drop of water that could survive in any landscape from a nuclear environment to the blood stream of a human body. What's the difference between the liquid and PB3? The liquid is what PB3 produces. The PB3 is actually an alien. We cloned the microbe's DNA. Are you telling me there's an alien loose down here? Jesus! Alien? Is that so hard to believe? I'm getting pretty tired of your bullshit, Lang. You'd better start feeding me something easier to swallow. Sir? Go ahead, Captain. We're still coming up blank on Harrison but we've been able to confirm that Ross, O'Brien, Trainer and Hall do in fact exist as members of the Charlie Squadron Delta. They're stationed in Fairbanks. Their C.O., Major Tindal confirms they were requested for a black op at 04:00. He won't give up any details of the mission. He wasn't cleared for it. Thank you, Captain. - It's an alias. - What are you muttering about? Harrison would never implicate himself if anything were to go wrong. We're down to working on secrets that our government can never admit. Things that could topple our nation's credibility. What if North Korea knew the kind of warfare we were trying to perfect? We're giving them a hard time with the nuclear program when all the while we're cloning aliens for military application. Are you telling me that you're an independent contractor working with the military on cloning aliens? You're not a believer. You don't think in this vast universe another life form exists? One that's more versatile, smart, dangerous we know humans to be? Every year, hundreds of meteorites slam into our planet. We found a drop of water on one. You have any idea how many we never find? How many other drops of water are out there? O'Brien, you see that? - See what? - Something tells me we're not alone. - What did you see? - What do you thing it was? Looks like a guy about 10 feet ahead. U.S. Army. Show yourself. Stand up and put your hands behind your head. - Are you here to help? - Hands behind your head, now! - I'm a doctor. - On your knees. I work here. Get you hands on your head now! Get down! Gun! - Hall's down! - Check him out! Hall! Hall! Get up, Hall! What's going on back there, O'Brien? He's got a pulse. He's alive. The suit is bullet proof all right. The guy though, where did he go? Freeze! Trainer, did you see that? O'Brien, look out! - Oh my God! - Something's on my hand! - It's burning! - What are you doing? Got to get this off! It's burning! My hand is burning! - Burning! - Holy shit, O'Brien! My arm is burning! Holy shit, O'Brien! Hang on. We got good air. I'm taking off your helmet. I'm going to stick you. Hang in there. Hall, get your ass over here now. Hurry up. What happened to her? Come on, we got to get her out of here right now. Move! Move! We've got a problem. The Captain's been infected. She needs help, now. - Cole, open the door. - I won't do that. Help! Let me in! Cole, you open the door right now and assist my team. Major, if we let O'Brien in here she could kill us all. Listen to me! You open the goddamn door right now! Trainer, tell me what color her eyes are. - What? - Her eyes. What color are they? They're black. - Black. - It's too late. Ross. We're losing her. You open the door, now! Give me a sec here, Trainer. I got a situation. We don't have a fucking second. She's dying! Suit up. We're taking her topside. We can't do that. She has been contaminated. Ross, we're losing her. Open the door! Open it now! O'Brien, this is Ross. You hang in there, all right? We can't take her out of the mountain. She'll contaminate every living organism she comes in contact with. Civilization as we know it, will no longer exist. We don't have a cure for this thing. She can't be saved. Get Trainer and Hall as far away from her as quick as you can. Out there they stand a chance of becoming exposed themselves. Cole ... get out here and fix her up. She's my partner, do you hear me? Open the door. I said open the goddamn door. Ross, she's been convulsing ever since she got infected. What did you do, bastard? You shot her, you bastard. Trainer, O'Brien was already dead. What? What? What she was infected with has no known cure. If we stand out here, we'll have better chance of becoming infected. No! I gave her the shoot! - I gave her the shoot! - She's dead, man. We got to get out of here. That's an order. You killed her! She covered you ass so many times! - She never would have survived. - I gave her the shot. I did what I was told ... and you should fix her up. - It should have worked! But it's a different strain and we have no cure. Now if we get infected, we die exactly like the same way. This liquid that attacked O'Brien ... Is this our alien? Alien? Like as in the movie? The liquid is a bi-product of the alien. It's doing exactly what we designed it to do. - You designed a fucking alien? - No, we cloned an alien. From a drop of water that was discovered on a meteorite. Weapons specifically designed to help preserve the human race. But before we could develop the counter-inoculation we had to first create de PB3. In theory we thought that if we could clone it, we could kill it. And then, we would be ready in case it ever attacked. You cloned a frigging alien and the government thought that was OK? It's also extremely intelligent. I'm going to sit down for this. Each time the PB3 encounters a new organism the alien's molecular structure co-ordinates an attack. It essentially consume us using our mass and our intelligence to grow ... mutating, changing. It can almost go into any form liquid or human. It has the ability to take the human host and attain its goal. And what the hell goal is that? It would like to control the planet. And it was OK to clone something that could control the planet. That's real smart. Real smart. And you alien escaped, start infecting your crew but somebody caught on and locked the place down. That seems to be what happened. But the PB3 is reacting unlike anything we have ever seen before. What it did to O'Brien and Hall, that's new. It's trying to breach our suits. It's learned to hunt. If this thing gets out, it will be impossible to stop. We can't let that happen. What do we do to control it? - We have been developing a ... - Cole! I need to show you something. Excuse us. It's the frigging blob. They're in love with this thing. We got to fucking kill it. Harrison convinced me to take it to the next step. He didn't want me working with anyone. Classified all my research. - I couldn't even tell you about it. - What are you talking about? I developed a new strain. - You did what? - The microbe was just the embryo. There's 3 chromosomes called X, Y, and Z and 3 sexes that cross-fertilize and mutate into a new organism. The Russians couldn't do it, you couldn't do it, but I did. Oh my God! My God, Peter. Why? You honestly think you could spend the rest of your life in this hole? I've been here for 5 years. I want out. I want out. - To do what? - To publish ... to receive the Nobel. - But for what? - The PB3. But that's impossible. You know it's impossible. For the security issues and because there's nothing to publish. We still don't know how it works. We can find out how it works. Prove that life exists outside our world. You have screwed us all. Suit up. We're leaving. I never signed up to fight no Martians. Command, this is alpha team. Command, alpha team reporting. This is Harrison. Report. Situation. Lang and Cole have identified an alien species loose down here. - Lang? - Yes, Colonel. Are you ready to come out? Yes, there's nothing more I can do here. Cole, how serious is it? - It's beyond our control, sir. - Cole, you call it. - I recommend immediate deployment. - Christ. - Major Ross? - Sir? Evac your people within 10 minutes. I'm going to nuke the mountain. Affirmative, sir. - Get your people out of there. - Thank you, sir. How far are we going to get in 10 minutes? 10 minutes is plenty of time. - Don't you worry. - But you're gonna nuke the mountain. You can't get away from a nuclear blast in 10 minutes. This facility is built to contain the blast. As long as we make it to an air lock we'll be safe. You see that? Straight ahead. I see it. What do you think, Trainer? I think that's the same stuff that attacked O'Brien. We back track and we go around. We don't have time. Don't worry. This is what we do. Trainer, Hall ... On my command. Let's see how this thing responds under fire. This one's for O'Brien. Fire in the hall! Go! Go! That's great! We just blew a water cooler. - We got to get out of here. - Nice shot, bro. Frigging water cooler. This is just wrong. Time is ticking, we got to go. Stay sharp, Hall. - Can't believe we just did that. - Goddamn it. A trained Delta force shooting at a water cooler. What's next? A killer vending machine? - Can't believe we nailed an alien. - Stay focused. Get out of here. We're almost there. We got to make it to the elevator. - Trainer, the door. Hall, cover. - Copy that. Copy that, sir. My God, what's with spiders? - Spiders? - Cole, watch your ... I hate spiders! We have to have control of the elevator. It's the only way out! Activate fire on the elevator! Clear the elevator! Ross, behind you! - Where are they all coming from? - Lang, watch out! Lang, are you OK? - There's too many of them! - Ross, they're on your feet! I got them. Trainer, 12 o'clock. Hall, watch out! Just keep firing, Hall. I don't know what to do. My God! It's a nightmare, man. It's a nightmare! - I don't know what to do. - Don't! Fire in the hole! Everyone, back up. Is anyone hit? Hall, what were you thinking? - I'm going to get out of here. - You just sealed our only exit. - There's got to be stairs. - There's no stairs. - He's going to save us, right? - I wouldn't count on it. Fall back, everyone! Fall back! - Hall, have you lost your mind? - There's got to be another way out. I sure hope so. First we've got to get to the lab and stop the nuke. - Shit, I forgot about the nuke! - We're screwed. Command, this is alpha team. Ross, you'd better be in that elevator. Elevator is negative for evac, sir. Hostiles in control. - Harrison, stop the nuke. - The count is at 00:03:10. Any chance you can make the auxiliary air lock? Negative, sir. There's not enough time. You'll have to re- set it manually. We can handle the manual detonation on this end. Susan, you know what this means. - Yes, sir. - It's your call. Don't worry. I'll handle it. All right, I'll stop the count. Come on! Ok. We're here. The bomb fuse is 5 levels below. The auxiliary air lock is about 300 yards down the passage way. Peter! Stand back. Nobody touch him. Peter! Peter! What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ! Where's the fuck it go? Peter! Oh, God! He's dead. Put your helmets on. We have to get out of here. Cole, you have anything that can fight this thing? Yeah, I think I do. Ross, we got to go. This weapon has been designed for close range combat. Fresh off the assembly line. They've never been tested on either. Wait a minute. We're going to be the first ones to use them? That's right. These are warheads, gentlemen, and they contain a gas design to kill a specific breed of alien. You'll be fighting a new strain but, hopefully, it should work. We have to get these toxins out of the warheads and into these canisters to load the guns. Piece of cake. The toxin was designed to infect those who have not been inoculated. I hope you don't mind needles. Shouldn't I get another warhead? Back over by the sink. There's a case on top, be careful. Doc, what do you make of this? - Oh, God! Oh, God! - What? Everyone out! Out! Get out, Ross! Jesus! Cole, what's going on? We got to get out now! Come on, let's go. Let's move! Shit, shit, shit. - What happened to him, Cole? - The toxin. - He's dead. - Cole, answer me. Oh, God ... Our helmets. The air quality is not good. We have to make it to a secure air lock. Let's get out of here. Lang is dead. We just lost Hall. - Have you reset bomb? - Not yet. We're on our way. Cole, we might be soon facing an invasion. We need to be prepared. Lang followed orders you wouldn't. You shouldn't let moral judgement interfere with your work. Harrison, we'll set that nuke, but that PB3 experiment ends here. - That ends now. - This is on your head. - Cole. - It's your decision, Cole. Are we facing a goddamn invasion? It this thing gets out, we're facing extinction. How long can we stay exposed to this air? Long enough to make it to the next air lock it we're lucky. Cole! More frigging spiders. What the frig is that? Go! Ross, let's go! - What the hell is that thing? - Run! - Cole? What is that? - Hurry up! Not enough air in here. Just get to the air lock. I'm slowing it down, but I'm not stopping it. - Oh, no! The keypad's not working! - Let me at it. - Cole, cover Trainer. - I got it. - Trainer? - I'm working on it. - Trainer. C4. - It'll be close. Come on, come on. - I got it. It's open. - Go. Go, go. My God. You guys OK? Yeah, you? I'm cool. It's not every day you almost get killed by an alien. Let's go. Be careful out there. Any more surprises waiting for us down here, Cole? I sure hope not. But we should expect the worse. Was that your missing experiment back there? I don't know what that was. Maybe it's some sort of mutation. You're learning quick, Major. - Let's just get this over with. - Sounds good to me. - Everybody watch their backs. - Let's do this. The bomb is in here. The air lock is at the other end of the tunnel. We part company here. I'll set the bomb and meet you guys outside. That's too risky. We stay together. Ross and I are going to cover the door. You're going to go in and set the timer then we all go to the air lock. OK. - Great. - They're guarding the bomb. - They know we're trying to kill them. - How do you want to handle this? Very slowly towards the detonator and hope for the best. - This isn't going to be easy. - There's so many of them. - Easy ... - They appear to be dormant. - Easy ... - No sudden movements. We should be OK. Let's get this done and get out. Watch your step. - Cover my back, Ross. - I've got your back. So far, so good. - Oh, my God! - Trainer? - Look out! - Cole, look out! Trainer, double time. Trainer, come on! Ross, behind you! Look out! Trainer, come on! Trainer, hurry up! Faster! Let's get out of here. Go, go! Come on! Trainer! Ross! The timer is toast. I can't get it to work. - What? - It doesn't work. The detonator? The detonator will work ... but I got to arm it manually. No. It's my responsibility. I'll do it. I'll give you enough time to get out. You're the only who knows how to fight this thing if it gets out. - Sir? - Get her to the exit. - No, Major. - That's an order. Yes, sir. You'll die. I've got no one waiting for me topside besides how often does a guy get a chance to save the world? I'm so sorry. Me too. - Trainer. - Sir? Get this to Harrison. My final order and I'd like to make good on it. Yes, sir. Ross ... you're a brave man. - Go on, get out of here. - Yes, sir. Let's go! Cole, look out! Go! Where the hell are they? Oh shit! Easy ... Trainer, I'm down. - You go. I'll set the bomb. - No. This is my responsibility. Not an option, OK? - Trainer ... - I'm not going to argue with you. It's what I do. That's my job. Go on. Get out of here. Wait. Wait a minute. Ross ... what do you want to do with this? That ends here. I knew you're going to say that. Get the hell off him. Die, you alien scum! Die! Oh, fuck ... - I love you, mommy. - I love you, baby. Are you OK? You all right? The others? They didn't make it. Did you secure sample? You know I couldn't do that. Your helmet? It's gone. You expect me to believe that? You're telling me a story that you couldn't possibly have witnessed. You were left behind, you were left for dead. It was the right thing to do. I would have infected the team. It was dangerous to keep me around. But I followed them out, I witnessed everything. How did you get out, if Cole was the last one in that air lock? Did you witnesses that explosion? The nuke would've killed everything. But you survived. - Yes, I did. - How? Isn't it obvious? I had to survive to keep my species alive. Do you believe in me now? Captain ... we need to get our guest to the White House. He was brought in at 09:00... and they figured he was responsible for setting off a nuke on U.S. soil. NORAD picked up a hotspot in the Alaskan mountains... just outside of Fairbanks. They contacted the warship Sumanza, stationed in the Bearing Strait. Commander Drew Stevens dispatches troops to the area... to observe phase one terrorist protocol. Expect the worst. Whatever happened was to be considered an act of war against us. That's when they called me. And in the hours that followed... I learned things that were going to change the way we live forever. Don 't move! There 's somebody at the door. Oh, God... You look like shit, son. Why don 't you have a seat, make yourself comfortable? Want to tell me your name? I 've already told you people. I 'm Doctor Peter Lang. I need to report to Major Harrison... of Charlie Squadron Delta. I don 't have much time. You a military man, Lang? Sort of. Sort of. That 's funny. I 've been in military most of my adult life... and I 've never met asingle person who was "sort of" in the military. You 're either in or you 're out, don 't you think? So a... pretty straight forward answer I 'm looking for here. So, I 'm gonna ask you again. Are you in the military? I can't talk to anybody in this building. I'm not authorized to. Call Harrison, and he'll understand the urgency of the situation. I got a pretty good handle on the situation. Two hours ago, somebody detonated a nuclear device on U.S. soil... and you 're the prime suspect. That 's either an act of war or that 's terrorism but either way... you 're going to answer any question I ask you. So, why don 't we start this again? Are you a military man, Lang? I need to report to Harrison, the Joint Chiefs or the President. I'm not authorized to talk to you and I won't. If you get Harrison, you might have a chance to save the world. Save the world. That sounds like a threat to me. You keep talking about this Harrison... right? We've been looking for him since you 've mentioned his name. And... guess what? There is no Harrison. The President and the Joint Chiefs don 't have the foggiest idea... who Peter Lang is nor do they have any interest in talking to terrorists. I suggest that you put me at the top of your priority list... and do it pretty quick cause things are about to get ugly around here. Why don't we try this again? Who do you work for, Peter? That kind of smarts, doesn't it? Most fellas start belleding from the ears, but you took this pretty good. -You don't look so bad. -I have... top information, and you 're treating me like a terrorist. I 'm doing that 'cause this is a matter of national security. A lot of people out there got a lot of questions... and I 've been given authorization... to use whatever means necessary to get answers to those questions. I suggest you start telling me what you know now... or we 're going to go through this over and over again. I can 't. I love these things. 4OO,OOO volts running off two nine volts batteries. This sort of torture used to be sloppy. Buckets, sponges, big cables. It just wasn't safe. Nowadays, I can carry 4OO,OOO volts in my hip pocket. Pretty effective, wouldn 't you say? I can 't tell you what you want to hear. You have to trust me. It 's for your own safety. You 're going to tell me what I want to know. Why don 't we keep is simple, all right? Tell me how your day started. -Hi, honey. -Hi, Peter. A phone call would 've been nice. You know how I feel about phones. Baby, go wait in your room, OK? Bye, Peter. See ya, Kimie. There 's been an incident in the lab. -ls everybody OK? -We don 't know. I need to get in. I need to find out and I need your help. Peter, I... An officer will look after Kimie. It won 't be long. OK. Give me five minutes. Don 't worry. I'll be back before you know it. -I love you. -I love you too. Bye, mom. -OK. Fill me in. -I will in the truck. Well... at 2:13, Fairbanks HQ received some sort of garbled transmission. A breach of bio-containment six. Two minutes later, somebody on the inside initiated a full lock-down. Power 's off. Interlock 's sealed. All communications to the outside world were served from the inside. Look, I... -I called Harrison. -Oh, Jesus. It could be any number of things. Chemical, or bio, or nuclear. Whatever it is, we 're gonna need help. There 're 14 people down there, and the clock is ticking. You 're right. We're going to need Harrison. We're going to go in with asmall combat team. Technical experts. Harrison 's very best. Highest possible clearances, just in case. OK. If we have to move in, we move in. But this team of experts they only the best, right? Right. Come to me. Don 't even think about it. I 'm on the clock, honey. Don 't you think this is more important than the clock? You're killing me. Sargeant Trainer. DCS tacticalbriefingin 10minutes, Trainer. Trainer? Did lcatch you at a bad time? No, sir. I 'm just about... to clear my weapon. We have a situation. Get O'Brien. You're going in tonight. Affirmative, sir. We 're going in. Why don 't you get whoever is on the phone to call you back? Trish? Daddy? I 'm toast. You... Trainer? I 'm Hall. Communications. -Good to meet you, Hall. -Good to meet you, sir. -You new on the base? -Yes, sir. -First time in Alaska? -First. I like it though. It 's cold. Trying to get used to the daylight. Never seems to get dark. Having trouble sleeping, sir. I've been here for two summers and I still can 't get used to it. -And don 't call me "sir". -Yes, sir... OK. What have you heard about this mission? We 're being sent there 'cause you banged the General 's daughter. -Jesus Christ! -What? Bad news travels fast. You know kids. No. You see... she had her 22nd birthday last week. Whatever you say, sir. Hear anything else? It looks that we 're going to be accompanied by Major Ross and... what 's-her-dick? Get my volley? -Ross... -Sir? I wonder why they 'd send a Major on a mission like this. Can 't say, sir. Haven 't met the man myself... but O 'Brien... she really drove our regiment into the ground in Iraq. She 's a tough mother for a hole, let me tell ya. That's what I heard... But why would a half-decent looking chick like O 'Brien... want to be an officer? Everybody knows any chick that tough has to be a lesbo. She 's get in the army to get the Colonel's daughter, probably. Sir... Ma'am! When you finished bonding, re-join the rest of the army. Full mission breaking in two. -Yes, ma'am. -Sarge... you need a larger weapon. Welcome to Alaska, Hall. Thank you, gentlemen. 'Ten-hut! All right, people, at ease. This mission is black. No medals, no rewards, no lucrative book deals. Our target destination is Vectol Bio-Research laboratories... outside Fairbanks, Alaska. Although it is a civilian facility, it is under contract to Uncle Sam... and my responsibility. Dr. Cole... Captain O 'Brien, is our best in bio-chem... Sargeant Hall, is our communications specialist... Trainer, weapons and explosives, lastly... Major Ross, our counter-terrorism expert. Dr. Cole? Three hours ago, someone at our lab initiated an emergency lock-down. We 've had no communication since. There 're 14 researchers trapped down there. We need to get them out. Only 23 people outside this room know about those labs. Of those 23 only a handful are privy to the work they do. Although this is classified, we'll give you what we can. -Dr. Cole? -Dr. Lang... head of the Bio-Weapons Counter Measures at Vectol. Vectol labs are located in an abandoned copper mine... 5OO feet below the surface. It 's been retrofitted as a high-tech bio-chemical facility. Access is through asingle air lock and elevator. There are four levels: research, weapons, chemical, living quarters. Below that is an emergency air lock. Once you 're in, nothing gets out. There 's been only one other breach of this facility two years ago. A lab tech accidentally spilled a thimble-full of nerve gas. A thimble-full. He died ninety seconds later. It took us three months to clean out that isolation lab. We are dealing with a full isolation lock-down. Trainer? Why us? Dr. Lang? Vectol Labs do a multitude of sins. Chemical, bio, nuclear toxins. Stuff we have down there makes Ebola look like the common cold. It 's possible terrorists breached the facility. We need to find out. Don't we have any other intelligence on this? Latest satellite re-con flight shows all is clear. Perimeter secure. This is avery sensitive situation. Fewer people envolved, the better, that 's why I'm sending the best. I 'm ascientist, but I 'm also a former Army Captain. Once inside, all of you answer directly to me. Trainer? People? -ls that clear? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Good. These are not your standard suits. They 're made from Kevlar Purine fiber. Think of them as a2nd skin. Your atmosphere gauge is at the wrist. Green is for good air, yellow for questionable... and if it 's red and you 've just breathed it, you 've died. This is for your oxygen. You have about one hour 's worth. What are these syringes for, doctor? Excuse me. If one of you become contaminated... remove the hypodermic from the pouch... and then plunge it directly in the neck... as deep as... Don 't do that. ...as possible. -Avoid severing the carotid artery. -I 'll do that. The needle releases a neuro-toxin. It would save your life and get you to treatment as quickly as possible. And what if we don't get stuck? What happens then? That depends on which toxin you've been infected with... but within 1O seconds your throat constricts. You can 't breath. Your esophagus becomes brittle and it dissolves. Your organs turn to jelly as your molecular structure is collapsing. But after that, you should mercifully black out. I get the picture. Have either one of you tried... this needle? Yeah. Dr. Cole has. What happened? Gear up. We move out in ten. Any other questions? Dismissed. I think she likes me, O 'Brien. What are you talking about? She 's a grown-up. I should try that. Colonel! Major. Permission to speak freely, sir. Go ahead. I 'm not comfortable taking my orders from these scientists. You take your orders from me. Follow Cole and Lang to the letter. Yes, sir, but babysitting civilians is... Cole can take care of herself. It 's Lang I need you to cover. He works for me. His project is classified... has top priority on the Pentagon. Cole doesn 't know about it. -She thinks she 's in command. -Work with her all the way. If it 's viral or chemical, she 's in charge. It it 's terrorist, you take command. Your priority is make sure Lang gets his research out. My team has the highest security clearance. I need to know what 's going on down there. This is a matter of national security. Nobody can know about it. When it comes to biologicals, even the President is expendable. Yes, sir. Lang is the priority. If I 'm a terrorist, what 's my primary target down there? There's enough plutonium in that mountain to satisfy asmall army. Terrorists or not, we're going to find our people okay down there. Just hope my staff are safe. With this lock-down there's a chance the air's been contaminated. Keep your helmets on and breathe easy. And conserve your air as long as possible. You got that? Cole... if we do encounter terrorists, stand down and let my team handle this. Your team? Your team will do what I say. This is a chemical lab. Nobody does anything without my approval. You got that, Major? Trainer, hold up asec. -I've got a bad feeling about this. -You 're just scared. That 's not what I meant. Chemical weapons, possible terrorists... small crew, civilian in charge... We 're going in there and no one is telling us anything about it. How many times have you and I been down this road before? You watch my back, I'll watch yours all right. -I hate working with civilians. -You wanted Delta. Deal with it. Lang. What? The minute you know how to get out of there, you let me know. I don't need my team staying in this tunnel any longer than they have to. I'll recommend immediate e-vac as soon as I get what I need. And, Major, our relationship stays confidential. That's what I hear. Peter, check the intercom, see if anyone responds. No, doc, not a good idea. If they 're terrorists you don 't want to give away our position, right? Good point. Let 's keep the chatter to a minimum, OK? Jesus, Lang! Will you back the fuck up? Holster that weapon. -This isn 't right. -What 's your concern, Cole? The reading. There 's something in the air but I don 't know what it is. What 's with this water? I have no idea. I 've never seen anything like this. -Hey, Ross. -What have you got? Looks like a gold tooth. -That 's a little more than unusual. -Got some slime all over it. What 's the slime like? Is it toxic? I don 't think so. Cole, you should take a look at it. Maybe the sprinkler system broke here. It 's not HO or retardant. Cole... what do you think? -Major! -Hall. Got a Number 45 here... emptied the clip. What the hell they shooting at? No matter, but stay Sharp so it doesn't end up shooting at you. I found a pacemaker. It 's still beating. Jesus! This is creepy. We need to get to work. Hall, Trainer and O 'Brien... restore communications and power. It 's through these doors. It 's down one level. Keep to the right. It 's at the end of the hall. After that, sweep level 3. It 's the living quarters. Wait. You want us to split up? Ross, what do we do? You have your orders. Report if you see anyone. RCB will be level 2. Containments labs. We'll meet there. -How many people we looking for? -Fourteen. You heard the lady, let 's move out. I think we should look for the guy with the pacemaker. Just my luck, I'm red shit, baby. This way. Dr. Lang, this isn't a picnic. Let 's move. -This is worse than we thought. -You recognize it. It 's got the molecular structure of human DNA. -Doctors? What is this stuff? -We 're not sure just yet. Major, I wouldn 't stand under there if I were you. Where the hell is everybody? I don 't know. Trainer... ever notice our missions have become a little more hazardous? What are you talking about? Look around you. We 're in a factory full of biological weapons. So, what 's that got to do with me? She's jailbait and she's the Colonel's daughter. Would you put a pipe in it? She's not jailbait, Captain. She looks at least 19 or 2O. That 's my man, Hall. She ain't no child. You're just jealous, O'Brien. Come on, O 'Brien, who you kidding? Wouldn 't you take a run at her if you had a chance? Careful, Hall, or I'm going to take a run at you. Want to get you guys a room? Hall 's not my type, Trainer. -He thinks I 'm a lesbo. -I 'm OK with lesbos. Just kidding. It 's gone. What? No, that 's impossible. -What 's gone? -I can 't talk about it with you. I don 't give a damn about your secret weapons. I 'll tell you what you need to know when you need to know it. -Are my people in any danger? -Not more than the rest of us. -That 's not an answer. -Give us a moment, Major. One of our experiments has gone missing. We need to find it. -Ross. Copy? -Go ahead, Captain. Auxiliary power was up in the lab level only. The generator doesn 't work. Hall can 't get any more power of it. Good work. We 've completed the sweep of the living quarters. Not asoul, sir. Proceed to communications. Try to raise Harrison. And Captain... watch your back. Anything on your end, sir? One of the doctor's experiments has gone missing. -What kind of an experiment? -They 're both tight lipped. Until I know more, assume we 're still dealing with terrorists. Exercise extreme caution and report back every 1O minutes. Understood. It's not just awalk in the park. Not today. If I can squeeze any more out of them I'll contact you. Roger that. -Reporting back in 1O. -ln 10 minutes. Missing experiment. -Doesn 't sound too good. -Not in this place, it ain 't. Stay Sharp. We got a job to do. What the hell happened here? You fix this up, Hall? Raise topside? I could raise Mars if I had to, but... it 's probably easier to... jerry-rig the up-line and get cell communications working. This is creepy. Slime covering everything. Like something out of the Blob. -Holy shit, Hall, that 's it. -What? The doctor's you don't drink with us, you're a son of a bitch. - What did you call me? - I said you're a son of a bitch. - Take it easy, man, it's cool. - This guy is a son of a bitch, isn't he? I wish I could get inside his head and rescue the sweet, compassionate man hiding inside. He got used to mixing alcohol with the medication the doctors prescribed when he returned from Vietnam and now he can't stop drinking until he finishes the bottle. - Hit me, please. - The usual? The usual. What are you doing? Go to sleep. You know, Iván, Junior asked me today, "Mom, when will Daddy come home?" And for the first time in my life, Iván, I thought, "I hope he never comes back. " - Julia, don't be a pain in the ass, okay? - I'm getting fed up, Iván, I'm telling you. Stay in the street. Don't come back here. Forget this house. After I work my ass off all day for you, you don't want me to come to my own goddamn home to sleep? Lower your voice. Don't get abusive with me! Abusive is you wanting to keep everything after I have to deal with this city all alone. All alone? Bullshit! I'm the one who's been left alone raising your kids, putting up with your drinking. I'm the one doing the cooking! - You're a bastard. - Don't talk to me like that! You son of a bitch, don't you dare ever hit me again! You piece of shit! Julia! It's so sad to end this way, after so much love! Iván survived a war in vain to come to die in another. If only he could let me find him, if only he could understand that he doesn't have to struggle alone. Aidita, this is not going to be easy. Listen to me! Listen to me! Remember what we talked about? Look at me! I'm all right, I'm all right! - We're here to help you! - I'm all right! Do you remember what we agreed? We agreed that you were going to quit and I was going to help you. That's what we're doing now. Listen to me! It's going to be tough, but you have to work with me! It's your fault I'm so fucked up. - Give me the tonic. - No! I don't want any! Listen, you're going to feel better. You have to work with me. Aidita, we want to help you. Don't you understand? Let us help you. No, I don't want your help! In this town everybody knows you're a... Drink it, please. Listen, I'm going to die soon! I have no time to waste! - We will not leave you alone. - I can't! Don't leave me alone! We won't leave you alone. Take a deep breath. I can't. Don't leave me alone. I can't. Easy... Well, Pete, I'm going to stop this. You'll see. And what are we going to stop it with? With a legion of federal officers stationed all along the beach? It's much easier than that. Look, we just have to choose one person and make an example out of him. What would you rather do? Would you prefer to go house by house explaining to each one of them that they have broken a federal law... What's up, Machito? - Get me drink, I'm burning up. - Have a beer on me! Look, the Cub Scouts are out of uniform. - Cheers. - I take back my offer. Hey, is it true you're shortening the conch fishing season? I haven't heard anything about that. Well, we're on it, but you know, the government is very slow. Good morning. I built this shack. Are you Iván Mart¡nez Rosa? - Have we met before? - We've heard about you. We're federal environmental inspectors. We have been told that you're using this key without proper authorization. Well, I come by once in a while. I fish, cook my fish. That's not illegal, is it? The problem is that it always produces garbage and other contaminants. That's why we cannot allow visitors. The small amount of garbage I produce, I take with me. Besides, I don't use plastics or chemicals. I'm like the Taino Indians. Look, for starters, bonfires like this one are forbidden on our beaches. Also, all the keys in this area have been classified as natural reserves, so you can't be partying here with booze. I don't allow anybody to bring alcohol to this place. Oh, you don't allow it? Let me see your property deed. Don Iván, we came to examine the area because we've been informed that you're having private parties here. Private parties? That's not true! The point is, we're not going to allow you to return to this key again, period. But I only come for short visits from time to time. - But you already built a structure. - If you can call that a structure. Iván, what's going on? These guys came to tell me that I can't come back here anymore. Hold on, we're federal inspectors. But we do no harm here. What's the problem? You see, Pete? These people really have a good time here. This man only wants to spend the last days of his life... - Willie, Willie, they don't care about that. - Well, they should. It's just that they give you a uniform and a gun, and you think you can come and push us around. You're a couple of bullies! Luckily, they're peaceful people. I appreciate it, but you can be more useful if you go back to Julia and tell her I'm going to be late. You go, you go. I'll stay here and return with Iván. - Are you sure? - Yes. Let us know if you need our help. This man just wants to come here and spend some time... But let me explain! Aidita, come out here! Iván, give me back my daughter! Aidita is resting. And mind your manners. I didn't come to argue with you. My business is with Iván. - And what business would that be? - Aidita! I can take care of her. - Is that so? - Yes! I don't avoid my responsibilities and I don't run away, Julia. Ask her! I've tried, but she doesn't want to or can't do it. I don't know. So you gave up? What did you come back for, Julia? To fuck with my head? Does it bother you so much that I'm taking care of your daughter? Julia, you left me, you failed me. What can I say? That's life. You're great with excuses. How convenient. "That's life. " Yes, that's life. I just want Aidita to be all right. Call her out here. - She's okay with us. I guarantee you. - Call her! Let's go, Aidita! - I'm not leaving, Daddy. - Let's go! No! I'm fine here. I've never felt better in my life. Mr. Mayor! Pitito, are you aware that Iván was kicked off the key? To tell you the truth, I wasn't. Were you aware of that? First they kicked him off, and now they won't let us fish there. - That's the best fishing spot! - I'm fully aware of that. I have a family. How will I feed them? Pitito, I make my living fishing and I have two small kids. Why won't they let us go there? Because you have to go through the proper channels. No federal law is going to stop me. They can kill me, but I'm going back to the key! Yes, but we must take it easy. We can't use violence. - What are you going to do? - I'm meeting with the governor tomorrow. I'll bring this up. Write it down so we can include it in the agenda. I promise you that tomorrow I'll have an answer for you. I promise. Tomorrow for sure. Tomorrow. - What's your name? - Iván. Hello, I'm Julia. That girl has something that makes her different from the others. - That girl's going to be my girlfriend. - You're going to be my brother. What couple? You're not a couple, we're a trio. To have a family, right here on my little island of Culebra. Iván, your grandmother died. I came to return this to you. It's yours. Weren't we blood brothers? Tell me something. If you weren't dead, what were you doing in the war? Partying with the Vietnamese women? Where did you go? What the fuck are you talking about? You were in your war and I was in mine, trying to keep Julia's spirits up. Nobody believed your tale about the prison camp. So, why didn't you stay there? What did I do to you to deserve this? - Didn't you want to talk? - Yes, I wanted to talk. - Hear me out! Hear me out, damn it! - We're talking! Julia had already forgotten about you. And then something happened that we couldn't avoid. Julia and I... Julia and I... Whose idea was it to leave for New York? Julia left to be with me because she loved me. - Ask Julia to tell you the truth. - What good is it now? Please, help me. If the feds keep me off the key, they're going to tear out my soul! Then we're even. For what it's worth, you are the person I've missed most in my whole life. I don't know what happened and I don't care. If I wronged you, I'm sorry, forgive me. But I'm a man of my word, and you'll always be my blood brother. There are more than 400 signatures here. There are more than 400 signatures here. Tell the Governor that all of Culebra is behind this effort. - Pitito, I'm counting on you. - Relax. "Relax. " I see you're celebrating the mess you made. That's all I needed. What did I do... Look, Daddy, everybody knows that you're responsible for all this. Aidita, you're still clean. Yes. That's good, that's good. And no thanks to you. What about you? Will you keep on drinking? There are a lot of things you don't know about, so don't piss me off. Don't piss me off! - Daddy, I'm fed up with all this. - Fed up with what? I'm fed up with all this. You argue with me, you argue with the whole world! I'm fed up with being the bad guy who always screws up. I'm fed up, too! Oh, what a pity. We have to feel sorry for you, the victim. Look, Daddy, that's enough! And now to top it all off you're a traitor and a snitch! - I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't know what I'm talking about? Everybody in town knows that you tipped off the feds so they would take the key away from Iván! I didn't do that. Shit! I didn't do that! Look, people, I just spoke with the Mayor. He was told that the Governor does not have jurisdiction over the key and he can't do anything. Meanwhile, Iván is in a sickbed. Well, they're wrong. They are wrong. We have to take matters into our own hands. You, Ayala! You, Pedro! You, Benicio! We can't allow governments to tell us what we can or cannot do on our land! Look, the key is ours, and the time is now. I mean, if we are real culebrenses, if we have courage in our hearts, we will claim that key right now. The key is ours, damn it. What the hell? Pete, Pete, stop that! Look! Stop that! Look! Here come those fools! They're looking for trouble. Do not attempt to disembark. Disembarking on this key is a federal offense punishable by law. Attention, attention! This is your final warning! What are you doing? Are you crazy? There are children there! I'm warning you for the last time. You cannot land here! - Come on, get out! Get out! - You're the ones getting out! - Take it easy! - This key belongs to all Puerto Ricans! This key belongs to the federal government! You're the ones who have to leave! Come on, arrest me! I'd rather die than leave! Don't worry, mister. We're not "tres-passing!" We're "mucho-passing. " And we'll camp here until they give us the key back! Don't be afraid. I won't leave you alone. What a beautiful view. What a pity you can't enjoy it. THE KEY IS OURS! This doesn't look good. Hey, Sylvia, what's up? Sure, I read the front page. Oh, yeah, I think that's great. Yes, that's what they should have done. That's what I told them to do. Don't worry, I'll handle this. Very well, good. Guys! I just received a call from the federal agency. Everything worked out fine. We won! Let's go to Iván's house and tell him. Come on, let's go! We won! I told you to trust your mayor! Your mayor never fails you! I'm here to serve you, to defend you till the end. And in the next elections, remember to vote for me. I hope you'll be able to love again. - The key is ours! - Yes, it is! - The key is ours! - Yes, it is! Friends, we rescued the key! Let's go get Iván! I'm going to be alone, Iván. One step at a time. Don't give up. You'll never be alone again, Aidita. Matilde, come here! Look who's coming! - Kike, what are you doing here? - I came to see Iván. You must be crazy if you think I'II let you in. Don't you ever give up? Let the man die in peace, Dad! I didn't have anything to do with all this. Don't deny it. I saw you with my own eyes. You were talking to the feds. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Liar! To think that I've loved you all my life. I don't know what the hell I saw in you! Matilde, you know me better than anyone else. I'm running out of time! Let me see my friend, let me see him, please! Iván. I'm here. - The key is ours! - Yes, it is! - The key is ours! - Yes, it is! You did it! The key is yours, Iván, you did it! Blood brothers forever. - The key is ours! - Yes, it is! Julia, we made it! We won the battle. The key is ours! We've come here to share this victory with Iván. He can come back to the key because the key is ours. Thank you, thanks to all on behalf of Iván. He's very grateful for all that you have done. Thank you. Of course! The key is ours! Iván. We're back on the key now. Just the two of us. We're walking on the warm sand. The sea is beautiful, as always, a dark turquoise blue. The breeze is caressing our faces, our hands, our bodies. The sun guides us. We're on your key, Iván. There's a place we all look for. A place of innocence, of healing, of happiness, that may not exist, but the quest to find it is what keeps us alive. To all the men and women who have fought and still fight for the harmony between human beings and nature. 'Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate is the garden of Eden 'but it's been a good home to us - me, Frank Gallagher, 'and me kids who I'm proud of, 'cos every single one of them reminds me a little of me.

BO YS LAUGH lf anyone laughs, it's coming off. Marty, where's your tie? I couldn't remember how many times the fox went round the farmyard. Three, and then into its den. You look great, Marty. What job is the interview for? Traffic warden. Council are equal opportunities employer. Make a change! Traffic warden calling the car drivers a cunt! Bullshegg! What the fuck was that? Something we've been working on. To manage his Tourette's for the court case, you replace rude words with... nicer ones! We're going to prove that he's a reformed character. Don't knock it, I haven't had a bucketbiff in days. What you in court for, Marty? Setting fire to things again? Shh! No, weren't even my fault! That stupid bitch in the Post Office looking down her nose at me making sarky comments...stupid soft kittens! She needed telling! Just a shame they had CCTV. Ever speak to me like that again, and I'll burn your house down, you evil, ugly, patronising bitch!

Can't believe you're here. Last I heard you were in Pathos with Big Balls Benny. Ditched him soon as I got out there. Got myself a nice little bar job, apartment on the beach, and as much cock as I could handle. Sun, sex and sangria, thought I were in heaven, Kev. So why are you back? Because, Blondie, I fell in love. Bloke called Jack. Jack Russell. You know, like the dog. As soon as I set eyes on him, I knew. I just knew. Got a light? What happened? It's all gone wrong, Kev. I'm sorry! Hey, come here and tell your big brother. He's a fucking junkie. Ah, Jesus! - Not heroin! - Didn't he watch Grange Hill? I said, "Jack, I love you - "but either it goes or I do." Got any sugar for this? siren No way, Kev, absolutely... SHOWER ON ..no way am I having her in my house! Veronica, she's me little sister! I can't just chuck her out on the street! Oi! Hang on a minute. The amount of shit I've had to put up with with your family, with your mother and her fellas, and Marty and his bonfires. Fair's fair, right. You can't send her back to a junkie. Couple of days. But if she calls me Blondie again, I swear, I'll... (Marty) I'm a good human being with a great deal to offer. I am a good human being with a great deal to offer.

He should've been back hours ago. Why, where's he gone? Job interview. We're trying to get him on the straight and narrow. Bloodyhell,Debs! Know when you're beat! He's had psychologists, psychotherapists, cognitive behavioural assessments, and they all say he's off his lolly. Why doesn't anyone give him a chance? All he wants is to be accepted. To be treated like everybody else. Help! Marty, you're making a big mistake! You two-timing piece of shit! No! Not content with one beautiful woman, no, you've got two! Marty! Guess what Marty's discovered, big secret, I'm married. is that it? What? Everyone knows that. Prick. No one told me! Wife appears, I thought he were doing the dirty. It's over, has been for ages. So why you still living with her? Because she won't move out, and it's my dad's fucking house. She's gorgeous. Marty, tell me you went to the interview. DOOR SLAMS This was supposed to be a surprise. Get in. Start her up. Bloody hell! I didn't even think it had an engine! is this leading where l think it is? Me and you, the open road. Nowt more romantic than a camper van. You've obviously never stayed in a five-star hotel. It's not exactly what I had in mind. You'll put up with anything when the sex is fresh. Blondie! No hot water! How do you turn the immersion on? I will fucking kill her. If you'd rather stay in a BB somewhere... No, no, it's great. Honest. Just think we might have to fumigate it first. Craig, your wife's at the front door. Oh! You living here now, then? Where I sleep's my business. You've not been home in over a week. - Home? - Well, you know. Oh, my dad's house. Place you want half of. You actually wanting something or is this a social visit? Boiler's playing up. Place is like an icebox. You know that book with the coloured pages? And how much is that going to cost? All right, I'll sort it. It'll have to wait till after the weekend. We're going on holiday. Send me a postcard. If that boiler's bust, I'm Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. - Boo! - Argh! No, no, I'm sorry! It's me, from earlier! I didn't mean to scare you. It's all right. You took me by surprise, that's all. You manage to find him, your husband? Sugar lumps! Don't hide it for my benefit. Your Tourette's. Lad at our school had it, everyone called him Fuck Off Phil. People only think it's weird when they don't know what it is. I'd better get back. I think he's an idiot. He must be, to let someone like you slip through his fingers. Marty, wasn't it? Horse sex! I can't believe you're bringing your own fire wood! Camping trip needs a camp fire. When I was a kid, I used to set fire to my sister's dolls when she annoyed me. Hiya! You're taking the piss. Before you get your knickers in a twist, I'm not here for you. They're going on a date. Who's going on a date? Ta-da! Look at this handsome devil! You'relikeayoungBruceWillis. Long time since I've been courted. Take my advice, Fiona. Enjoy it while it lasts. Right, what's the game? Game? I'm going on a date. Didn't know there were a law against it. Convenient - bagging a bloke who lives in the same house. What difference does it make? Anyone'd think you still had feelings for me. Shall we? See ya, Debbie. Seeya. Don't wait up! Having a girlfriend's got to be good for his court case. I'm going chestnut brown. New life, new look, that's my motto. It looks like a bleedin' protest. You ever thought of changing colour? Bit '80s, that look, isn't it? is it? Sharon Stone, Madonna. They were all at it then, but... - l think your bloke's hanging about outside. - You're joking. Tall, skinny, a bit Iggy Pop. For God's sake, don't let him in! If he's not had a fix, he gets violent. Marie! I know you're in there, come on down! I've gotta be at work in ten minutes. I'll shoot out the front. I'm coming with ya. You're not leaving me with him! CLATTERlNG lt's your shot. Which one am I going for? Go for that red one into the bottom corner. lt should go in, that. But if you lean over and get right on the cue, Get it just between your fingers there. It'll go in there. Oh, I think I've had too much wine! Rubbish. More you drink, better you get at this game. Shut it! machine'S winning jingle Jackpot! And it had a little wind chime. Twisted freak. How can sticking a needle in your arm be normal? Tell me, who sees that as normal? I know, but... love's blind, Frank. Look at Kev with Veronica. You're not telling me he couldn't do better. A word from the wise. Get your stuff out, otherwise he'll have your stereo in his veins before you can say, Dolby Surround Sound. All right, Frank. We're dealing with it. Yes, but when? Druggie, Kev. We're talking desperation, we're talking scum of the earth. No, thing is, I can't. I ain't got a van or anything. Wait, no problem. Eamonn! Eamonn! How do you fancy being this lady's knight in shining armour? Depends. ls there a pint in it for me? Spunk face, bucket of spunk, what else do you do? Piss flaps. Donkey dick... Donkey dick! Come on. I want to show you something. Bucket! SHE LAUGHS You ready? Yeah. Three, two, one. What am I looking at? The most beautiful place in the world. What, that? To other people, it's just a gas tower, but to me, it's...awesome. Beauty's everywhere. Just depends whether you choose to see it. Boner! Sorry, sorry. Don't apologise. That's what makes you who you are. Craig must be off his head. How can he live without that? Let's go back to yours. Er...what's all this? ! A few home comforts. Sneaked in while Jack were out. Don't look at me, it were Frank's idea. Figures, might've known you'd stick your nose in! Goodness of me heart! Rescue mission, damsel in distress! You'll stay for a smoke, won't you? Few drinks? Top, yeah. Don't mind, do ya? Blondie? Time's up, Kev. For fuck's sake! (Frank) Down from that castle, Rapunzel. Let down your golden hair. GlGGLlNG Ow! Toss! GlGGLlNG Oh! GlGGLlNG Suck me cock! Sorry. Craig, maybe you've got it wrong, maybe she really likes him! I know he's got his problems, but he's a good-looking bloke. I've known her a lot longer than you, and she's sticking the knife in. By pulling Marty? Kinky boots! Just her presence in this house, it's like poison. Let her shag him! Let her scream the house down! Why should you care? See? This is exactly what she wants. I can't get me... Get your top off. What? ! I can't do this. My head's all over the place. We can wait. We don't have to rush it. It isn't that. lt's just... I like you, and I've had a great time, but... it's Craig. What about him? - He's still my husband, Marty. - l thought it were all over. We've been married eight years. It's comfort more than passion, but you can't just turn it off. It's all such a mess. You still shagging him? You mustn't tell Fiona. Promise me, you won't tell Fiona. Marty! No! Do you want her or not? - What the fuck are you talking about? - Him! Fucking Casanova! Stringing you both along, wanting it every which way! - What have you told him? - Nothing! She told me the truth. What fucking truth? About him and her. He's still shagging her. Even though he don't even want her. You lying... Stay away from her, I'll break both your fucking legs! Fiona, he's messing you around, he's messing everyone around. It's not fair, cos l could make her happy, and he don't even love her. When did you last sleep with him? Fiona! We're having this out. Tell me, when did you last sleep with him? - l'm not looking to hurt you. - When did you last sleep with him? Last week, last month, last year? She's telling the truth! Marty, open your eyes. She's trying to break us up. She's fucking using ya. She's not. She wouldn't. We've kissed. Do you think somebody like her would be interested in a freak like you? Craig! She is! Tell him! Tell him how you feel about me! Oh, shit! Jesus,thebaby! - Baby? ! - l'll go and get an ambulance. I knew it. You're going to leave me, aren't you? It's like bedlam out here! Wait! What's all the racket? It's nothing. lt's OK. Tell Craig forget about the ambulance. Leave me alone! Please, come back. Marty, look. SOBBlNG Prick! Spunk face! We've got a little world of our own I'll tell you things that no-one else knows I'll let you in when no-one else goes We've got to do it without you I'll tell you things that no-one else knows, I'll let you in when no-one else goes We've got to do it without you... Oh, no. - l'm only helping cos we wanna get rid of it. - Fiona! He's torn his mantra! He's in court on Monday! I'm going on holiday, what do you want me to do about it? What'supwithyoursulkychops ? I'm moving out. I'm not stepping foot in that house until my idiot husband gets rid of that stupid bitch! The house is covered in tat. Can I stay at yours, Fiona? You can have my room till I get back. Who's your mate? Alfred. He's the only bloke I can rely on. Ahh! (All) Bye! - For fuck's sake! - Craig, don't! What is it with you, eh? Don't you think you've caused enough damage? Go home, because I'm going on holiday with Fiona and there's nothing you can say to alter that. Craig. Your dad's dead. Ta. Three years he's been in that home. Hanging on and hanging on. Trust him to pick this week to go. Get out! - No! Who says he doesn't remember anything? Never come here again, or else I will kill you! Get out! I don't want to see you here again! Get out! Don't come here again! Get out! What happened? What are you doing? What happened, Shoba If your son is mad, tie him with the chain. Now get inside! Go and die! What is this, my dear son? Why did you come here? Unniappam... Unniappam! Unniappam! Central Sir, Joseph has gone! My Joseph has gone! Yesterday also he spoke about you... ...before going to sleep. Call him Sir! Call my Joseph, Sir! Wake him up, Sir! He is sleeping after sending off everyone. Now who will look after us! Tell Joseph! Look, who all have come to see you! Open you eyes and see, Joseph! Hello. It's not Joseph, I am his cousin. He's smiling in sleep. Who is that? He's smiling in sleep. He went to sleep yesterday. He didn't have any problem. We are not taking him to native place. There is no one else to come. He is smiling... in the sleep. He is... smiling in the sleep. When he was alive, he made everyone laugh. Now he is smiling as he spoiled our planning. Mr. Ramesh, how are you? You've forgotten us, isn't it? Did you recognize me? I am PR... PR Nair. He is vijayan. He forgot everything, isn't it? Did you recognize who is sleeping inside? - C'mon. Why did you stop there? You can drive the vehicle up to the top. You can take the vehicle from this side. Let me go and see. Mother, see who all have come! You can drive the vehicle up to the courtyard. What is this? You come in the vehicle. I will climb the steps. Why didn't you inform that you are coming? I tried many times. Yesterday I even tried from Madras station. I forgot, our phone is dead. How was your exam? - Ok. That won't do, the newspaper should carry your photo. I have published in Ludhiana that you will get rank. Mother, you have come suddenly without informing! You were working in the kitchen? We couldn't get any information from you. So we thought of coming here. How are you, my daughter? Next month she is retiring, so she couldn't get leave. That's why we are late. Sir. - How much? Rs. 450. - How much? - Rs. 450. That's too costly. - It's useless to tell all that. Give, give. Come dear. He is working nicely. - He does everything. But it's only for some time. There is no continuity. Sometimes he is very normal. May be he is worried about speaking wrong. He doesn't say anything clearly. Very first the personality will change. Like this we have many patients in our hospital. Daddy! - Who is this? When did Sukumaran Nair come? - I came just now. Why Mr. Ramesh Nair you are not at all bothered about us. Son, he is asking you something? Do you know me? Do you know me? Then tell who am I? We met... the other day. Oh I see. When did we meet? When did we meet? We met? - But where? Can you tell my name? I have met you. - Tell Ramesh! What is your name? - Very good, say like that. My name is Sukumaran Nair. Do you recognize me now? Who am I? - Sukumaran Nair. But who is Sukumaran Nair? He is the one who gave me eatables. Brother, he is talking about whom? Sukumaran Nair is also the name of the guy who has a hotel and sell eatables. So he remembers the hotelier Sukumaran, isn't it? Sukurmaran Nair... Does he remember that? Ask him if he remembers Lekha. All right, all right. Do you know Lekha? My daughter Lekha? Come. Don't... irritate him. We should know if he remembers our daughter Lekha. Central I understand if you don't send him with us for studies. But if you don't try for the entrance, then? Everybody will make fun of you. For the admission of Sadi's son they had to pay Rs. 30 lakhs. If he doesn't want to be a doctor there are many other courses. IT has a very good scope now. - Yes. The children will say something. What they know? It's who should decide things. He can try for the IAS after getting the professional degree. I too said these things, but he is not listening. He just wants to go for civil services to fulfil his father's wish. Ramesh too went after it saying that it was your wish, then what happened? It all depends on the luck. If you want you can try after medicine or engineering. There is no risk even if he doesn't get. Son, we would have never said if things were fine. Your father would have managed everything. Now you should be more practical. The responsibility of the family is on your shoulders. Why don't you tell something, dear? Let... let me discuss with father. Now see, this is crazy! He doesn't understand anything. He too will become mad if he is not separated from Ramesh. What are you saying? This is not a contagious disease. I am like a light. I can show you the path, but you have to work. Both of them wants me to take admission in the Ludhiana Medical college. Father, why are you looking at me like this? I will not go anywhere if you don't like. Oh God! What are you doing? Father, take out your hand! Father, take out the hand from the mouth! Mother! Father, take out the hand! Mannu, what happened? - See this mother! What happened? What happened? Nothing, nothing. He has bitten his fingers. What is happening? - I don't understand. Brother, what is this? What is all this? He... he thought something and... Didn't I tell you? It's the same case. When I was in nursery he started collecting this to make me collector. How can I defeat that father? Central Don't make noise, koyal when my child is sleeping Please do not sing, nightingale when my beloved is sleeping Go away, Wind, don't touch with your fingers... Go away Don't make noise, koyal when my child is sleeping Please do not sing, nightingale when my beloved is sleeping Central Unknowingly his childhood has come to visit this adult He forgot himself and become like a small bud Central Now I have to become a mother and sing the forgotten lullaby for him. Don't make noise, koyal when my child is sleeping Please do not sing, nightingale when my beloved is sleeping Go away, Wind, don't touch with your fingers... Go away Don't make noise, koyal when my child is sleeping Please do not sing, nightingale when my beloved is sleeping What happened, Sir? You are thinking of becoming collector and crying? Yesterday I read till late in the night. There is irritation in the eyes. If God blesses, this would be last class. The final interview of the civil service is next week. All the best, Sir! - Thank you. Excuse me, just a minute. You didn't finish the class? I sold everything at cheap price. Nobody wants the bananas. Grandpa, there is a good news. What is it, dear? The result has come? Mother called and said that the interview card has come. Thank God! Congratulations. - Thanks. Other than the house... I am planning to sell everything. Now you won't need this. Plenty of money is required for going to Delhi and for the training. Grandpa, let me finish the interview first. It all depends upon the luck. - No luck at all. Three generations waited for this. At least one of us will be lucky, isn't it? See, though he has forgotten everything he is waiting for you. Central Coming! Hold this dear, let me give something to the cows. Thief. - Father, it's me Mannu. Mother! - Thief Mother, what is this? Since morning he is calling thief. He even called me thief. Don't know from where he got? He might have seen something and got scared. Did you tell him about the result? - No, you say. Thief... thief... - Father, am I thief? I am Mannu. I am your son. Father, why are you scared? I am Mannu! - Thief... Thief... thief... Father, shall I tell you some good news? Thief! Thief! - No, no, nothing. Mother, give me some tea. Thief... thief... It felt as if the fallen leaves have joined back the branches. As if different tunes are blended together to play in the same pitch. Cheta! - Father! What is this? Did you hurt, father? Is it paining? Father, I have passed the civil service exam. I got through the preliminaries and the main. The interview is in the next week. Interview... it's in Delhi. Father, you are going to win. Your son is going to be a collector! Who are you? Who are you sir? Mother, why should I win? Why should I win now? God... just for a second... just of a second can you give my son back? To see all this! Central Mother, don't cry. I studied all these years to fulfil father's wish. Now... now it's my wish to sit father in my chair. - Come, come. Come, or else we will be late. Brother, everyone is going to Delhi? No, daughter and I will get down at Trichur. We have to go to Guruvayoor. Everything is ready, isn't it daughter? - Yes. Son, call immediately when you reach. Mother, father has a slight temperature. You checked all the certificates, isn't it? I will call you, mother. Bye mother. Since last two days it's raining heavily. Yes, grandpa told this yesterday when he called from Guruvayoor. Where is father? What is he doing? - He is here. Don't know from where he has got a small bell? That is a good sign. It's good if he shows some interest in something. When grandpa calls, tell him that the interview is in the morning. I will call you tomorrow morning before going between 7 and 8. - You... you are prepared, isn't it? Don't worry mother, pray for me. I don't have any other work. Hello... hello... The power supply and the phone... it's gone. Cheta. Cheta. Oh my God! You spoke? I can't believe! Cheta... now you recognize me? Cheta! Cheta! Everyone... - What? Everyone... - Mannu has gone to Delhi. His interview is in the morning. God! How should I inform this to them? Father... father... - Father? Father and Manju have gone to Guruvayoor. To pray to God to get you back at least for a second. Oh my God! It felt as if the fallen leaves have joined back the branches. As if different tunes are blended together to play in the same pitch. The moon is blossoming like a flower in the palm. From the silence of her dried tears, began a song of relief. Central The bare hands have been drenched and filled with wedding bangles, as if the raindrops fell like pearls on lotus leaves. This instant flash of memory consists of an entire life filled with love. This remembrance calls for celebration and constitutes the song of life. It felt as if the fallen leaves have joined back the branches. The telephone is working! Cheta, what is this? You used to play like this with Manju. The power has come. Central Hello. - Hello, its mother, Mannu. Hello... Cheta, it was Mannu. You are sleeping like the child in the womb. Cheta, Mannu will call now. Talk something before he goes for the interview. Cheta. Cheta! Cheta! Hello. Hello, is this mother? - Yes. I called you 2-3 times, but it was disconnected. What happened, mother? Your voice is low. Did you go out in the rain? - No, nothing. Where is father? Did he wake up? Mother, I saw a dream yesterday. Father came to me and asked the questions for the interview. Then only I realised that I wasn't prepared. Father is with you, son. He is in your heart. Call me after the interview. - Hello. Who is your motivator? - My father is my motivator. Brahma, the creative God... created the universe. My parents are my Gods. He who leads from the darkness to light is true guru. My father is my guru. My Guru is my Lord Brahma, the creator. My Guru is my Lord Vishnu, the protector. My Guru is my Lord Shiva, the destroyer. My Guru is my Supreme Lord, I surrender and salute my Guru. 'Sunrays which give light to world have a short life span of a day only' NARRATOR: From the darkness of space comes a hero the righter of wrongs a hero named Xero. With the tip of his blade, a deep X he has made, the mark that stands for Xero. When evil tyrants steal, with the sword, they must deal. This sword belongs to Xero. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] The mark that stands for Xero is his claim to fame because he can't even spell his own name. MAN: We must put an end to this, Sergeant Vasquez. This El Xero character is putting unhealthy ideas into the heads of those peasants. If this keeps up, not only will we not be able to collect taxes but we'll have a full-fledged uprising on our hands. But who could this masked El Xero be? Comandante Hilgalgo, I've been pondering that very question. The first El Xero sightings began shortly after that emissary from the Galactic Protectorate arrived. [DOOR OPENS] Good morrow, gentle kinsmen. Ah, Captain Dodgers, it is a pleasure to see you. And you, comandante. Of course, you know my deaf-mute manservant Carstairs. Hello. I thought you said he was deaf and mute. You see, he, um-- You know, it's just that I'm-- I'm a ventriloquist. So tell me, Billy, how do you like school? Uh, closed. [LAUGHING] Oh, dear. Closed. Ha, ha, ha. Thank you. [LAUGHING] A word with you, comandante. Excuse me, gentlemen. It just slipped out. Look, don't mess this up. We've got him completely fooled. I know. But what's with all these costumed capers? You know that as a Protectorate captain I can't officially interfere with a less advanced planet. But I look out and see the suffering of the peasants, and my soul is touched. Give me your tired, your poor, your wretched garbage yearning to drink tea, to be born free as free as the wind blows, as free as the cock crows with liberty and justice for most. And besides, it's fun. [CHUCKLING] Closed. How witty. Sir, back to the El Xero thing. I believe he and Duck Dodgers are one and the same. Ridiculous. Whatever gave you that idea? Well, they are both the same size same black feathers, same orange beak. They both have a lisp and all that spit spray. They are both ducks. And I could go on, except I'm growing short of fingers. Ahem. A problem, gentlemen? Pay no attention to Sergeant Vasquez. He's fat. So, Captain Dodgers, have you given any more thought to my request? I have taken the matter under advisement. The things I could do with more advanced weapons. It would make ruling this planet much easier. Oh, I'm sure it would but the Protectorate frowns on providing weapons to less advanced civilizations. Please, comandante, isn't it obvious? - What? - He is El Xero. [LAUGHING] Oh, that's rich. [HILGALGO CONTINUES LAUGHING] Senor Dodgers, you must help us. Our people suffer under the boot of Hilgalgo. Such harsh talk from such a delicate face. HILGALGO: Captain Dodgers. - You forgot your hankie. - Thanks. These things are more expensive than you'd think. This is the man who's made misery of our lives. Such harsh words from such a delicate face. He already used that. Have you nothing to say? Have you seen this one, my dear? All flash and no substance. - Sergeant, take the senorita into custody. - Guards! You will never get away with this. HILGALGO: It appears, my dear I already have. [CHUCKLING] DODGERS: Hey, hey, hey, wait a second. Just exactly what's going on here? Well, you see, I'm scheduling a little hanging for the young lady I just arrested. When El Xero hears of it, he'll come to her rescue. Then I'll take care of him. The comandante will take care of him. Thanks, I think I got it. No problem. I majored in exposition in college. Sir, it is time. And I am ready. It's gotten a little drafty over here. And the view from over here stinks. At least this will make your costume change a little easier. Excuse me, I'm here to bring comfort and solace to the condemned. GUARD: Go right in, Padre. Huh. A pig. And I thought only a chicken could be a friar. Comandante, the hour grows late and there is still no sign of El Xero. Fear not. I'm sure he's riding to the rescue at this very moment. [MACHINERY CLANKING] This is the last time I buy a mustang. The sun sets. [KEYS JANGLE AND LOCK CLICKS] Don't be afraid, my child. El Xero is on his way. What do you know of such things, Padre? It is I. Comandante, we are losing light. Yes. What say we fire up some torches? That will give us more dramatic illumination. Got any nines? Eh, go fish. [TOOL BANGING] Why does everything have to be off warranty? [ENGINE POWERING UP] Auto Shop 101, excessive force. [HORSE NEIGHS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Whoa, whoa, whoa! I said, whoa! [ENGINE SPLUTTERS] For a second there, I thought this was gonna end in a hideous crash with a horrible explosion. Hey, Trigger, giddyap. Come on, Black Beauty. Tsk, tsk. I'll give you a lump of sugar. How about a man-sized churro? Maybe he has forgotten us. DODGERS: A Philly, extra cheese? Comandante, El Xero is very late. The crowd grows restless. Yes, but you must admit, the lighting is more dramatic. We must give the crowd something quick or we'll lose them. I'm pretty sure El Xero has arrived. [CLAMORING] Showtime. Good thing this extra-large cape doubles as a parachute. [WATER SPLASHES] Watch out. El Xero is very cunning. He could be anywhere. Well, not anywhere, I guess. There's no reason he'd be at the bottom of this well unless he were a complete dolt, an idiot but he's not. He's a worthy adversary. XERO: Man, my shorts really rode up. Now to rescue the beautiful senorita. [GRUNTING] Hey. Aha. [YELLING] Roberto, Miguel. Don't worry, it's only a flesh wound. Perhaps I underestimated the damage a bit. That's not the only thing you underestimated when you chose to tangle with El Xero. [GASPS] The mark of El Xero. Yeah, sure looks like it. Thanks. Now I can get Theresa to a safe place. You're all substance, no flash. Hey, fellas, wait up. GUARD: Look. El Xero. Hey. Ha. You and I shall become as one as we make our escape. - Yow! - Close the gate. Taffeta and silk for the well-dressed robot. GUARD: Say, this is really soft, but I can't see. Somebody help me! Help, please! [GRUNTING] My hat's off to you, gentlemen. A little trick I learned from Oddball. Oddball? [GRUNTING] I could watch robots blow up all day long. Another successful escape for El Xero. I don't know if I would go that far. Time for the climactic swordfight? How perceptive. Then let's have at it, villain. [GRUNTING] Huh? Excuse me whilst I retrieve my wayward weapon. Let's just watch the rough stuff, bub. I think you gave me a boo-boo on my pinky. Enough. You fight well, but not well enough to defeat me. Even if I fail, the peasants will rise up and overthrow your evil empire. The peasants are weak and will do whatever I tell them. Wrong again. Lo, the proletariat rises to thwart the evil oppressor. You win, Xero. Have you seen this one, comandante? - Duck Dodgers. - Told you. - How about this one? - Curses. Captain Dodgers, Captain Dodgers, that was great. 'Twas nothing. So where's your huddled masses yearning to breathe free? They got bored and went home to watch a rerun of Dragonball. So I'm made a reasonable facsimile in shadow puppets. Well, that gives me an idea. In order to fill the power vacuum, we'll have to install a government. - Oh, yeah? - A puppet government. - All right? - [IN SPANISH ACCENT] It's all right. Wow. Two full days of gorgeous golf at the Tiger Woods planet of rest and relaxation. This is gonna be the game of a lifetime. And check out my fancy new duds. New shoes a new moisture-wicking golf shirt and these new derriere-slimming slacks. I got all the best new equipment. - We noticed. - We noticed. Heh, heh, heh. Vintage is nice, but how about my hi-tech putter? It's the Mind You Flex Ez, totally state-of-the-art. It broadcasts waves of sonic energy allowing me to control the ball even after I hit it. Isn't that cheating? I prefer the term "technologically enhanced." It seems like cheating to me. Maybe that's why you're wearing the stupid outfit. [THUNDER CRASHING] [WIND WHISTLING] [SHIP POWERING DOWN] [SCREAMS] - What was that? ! - Perhaps a spatial anomaly. No way. It's a ghost. My ship is haunted. But, Captain Dodgers, there's no such thing as a gho- - Poltergeist. I will have you know that certain members of the Dodgers family are born with a gift. Just what are you getting at, Dodgers? I can communicate with the dead. [THUNDER CRASHING] Whoa. Was that lightning inside a spaceship? We better check this out. CADET: Why are we in the basement? - Because it's the spookiest part of the ship. Stay close, boys. We don't wanna be separated by the spirits. I don't believe in spirits. Me neither. This ghost business, it's pure hokum. It's silly nonsense. It's silly, juvenile nonsense. Right you are, my boy. A sure sign of an infantile mind. Yeah, for babies. Little girlie babies, heh. Crying to their mamas, "We're so scared." "Save us, Mommy, from the scary ghosts." Hold up. I think this is the place. I feel a cold spot. - What are you doing, captain? - Well, I'm trying to bring out the ghosts. They're attracted to the shimmering light. Then I drop in the bait, wait till the hook is sunk and reel those puppies in. That sounds more like fishing to me. Oh, do you like to fish too? Yes, but I thought we were hunting ghosts. Ghosts, is it? I'll let you in on a little secret. - I have a special gift. - I believe you mentioned that. The best way to flush out a poltergeist is with this. That's just an old instant camera. Deceptively simple but essential for spirit photography. I just snap a picture like so and wait a few seconds for it to develop and behold, the ectoplasmic entity. - That's your thumb. - Hmm. How's about this one? Thumb. Well, Chubby, take a look at these. Thumb, camera strap, thumb thumb, thumb lens cap, eyeball, thumb. Eh. That's for an article I'm doing in a respected medical journal. Um, this one's of a banana. Wow. Where would a banana come from? Mm. Mm, mm, mm. What are you doing? Well, if you must know, I have a potassium deficiency. Bananas are loaded with potassium. Now I know why he never comes on these adventures. zounds! Potassium deficiency is responsible for fatigue, constipation insomnia, gas pains, and low blood sugar. Odds bodkins. Captain, what is it? Behold a relic left behind by those who have shed their material form. - Oh, dear. - You doubted my powers, didn't you? But now the great unknown is staring you right in the puss. How foolish and small-minded you were. That goes for you too, banana fiend. I have a medical condition. Two weeks ago, this cup was filled to the brim with coffee. Now look at it. The coffee probably just evaporated. And whatever's left has turned to mold. Mold? Hmm. Yuck. Ech. [RUMBLING] Unbelievers. Captain Dodgers, where are you? [GASPS] Step forward. The great Duckini knows all, sees all. I will be a bridge to the other side. My crystal will allow me to peer beyond the veil. Speak to me, oh, disembodied souls. The departed draw nearer. I think he's in a trance. I am in a trance. I am your living conduit to the other side. The entities are beginning to speak. Aha! Did one of you have a grandfather? Yes. Yes, I had a grandfather. And was your grandfather, by any chance, a man? - He was indeed. - Hmm. I'm getting something with a P, a P word. Pam, Pat, Pen-- Did your grandfather ever wear pants? Oh, my, you're freaking me out. Now, we haven't arranged any of this in advance, have we? I've never met this duck before in my life. This is ridicu--Just plain stupid. [METALLIC CREAKING] Egads, the wail of the banshee. Here, stuff your mouth with garlic. Anybody got any thread to sew his lips shut? That's coming from the engine room. The atomic coupler must have come uncoupled. If we don't fix that thing fast, the whole ship will explode. How far apart do you think that coupler's separated? Oh, I'd say about an inch and a half. This should fit just fine. CADET: The conductive properties of this golf ball should complete the open circuit and restore the atomic power coupler. All you have to do is use your Mind You Flex Ez to sink a putt that winds through the machinery... - ...that runs beneath this open grate. - Okay. But that won't soothe the savage fury of the paranormal. Let's just give it a try, okay? DODGERS: Sure, whatever. [GRUNTING] You can do it, Dodgers. [METALLIC CREAKING] - Any chance we can escape in the shuttle? - Never make it in time. [RUMBLING] Then again, I lettered in track in high school. Abandon ship! I almost got it. [GRUNTING] Oh, man, it's stuck. I guess we're dead. GHOST: Been there, done that. You're the gh-- [STAMMERING] [WHISTLING] You're the gh-- You're the gho--Gho--Gho-- Boo! The ghost! [CACKLING] Be gone, foul spirit! Boo! [SCREAMING] Keep away, you freaky phantom! [SCREAMS] We'll never make it. [POWERING UP] Wait, he did it. He saved the ship. I never had a doubt, I.Q. Duck Dodgers is the bravest space captain I know. [DODGERS SCREAMING] Save me! And that's the last we'll hear of this haunted ship. That's right, because there's no such things as ghosts. That's what you think, Buster. [LAUGHING] [English - US -SDH] WELL TEMPERED CORPSES You fucking with me, Safet? Risto, give me a break, please. You've been fucking me with these tapestries for 5 years. Horses at a watering place, Quattro Stagioni, Ship in a Bottle. Ship in a Storm, you stupid unlettered peasant. And you are as smart as a curator. We're not working in a museum, but in a morgue. If you don't like it, kiss it and leave it. Where the hell should I go? To your family in Serbia? It's great prosperity there, rich life, famous brands: Nike, Marlboro, Levis... Safet, child of fetus? -Fetus. All you need is to start cloning people. Risto, rich man's wealth but robbery? [Laughing] NAN, VOICE-OVER: gradually, I was drawn in to the center of their lives. I had never given a thought to politics, but now I couldn't escape it, it seemed. There was going to be a big rally at Victoria Park. florence was helping to organize it, and ralph was to speak at it. [ralph speaking indistinctIy] And my own life was opening up as well. This way, ladies. Hmm. It's the best dressing room in the house, Miss King. I trust it meets with your approval. Yes. I think it'II do me very nicely, thanks. [Laughing] Oh, flo. What is the rich man's wealth but robbery? They steal the land and set a wall about it. They steal the fruits-- flo, please be quiet. How's a man to think? And steals the fruits... The fruits-- the fruits of our labor and obliges us to buy them back from him! Good! Oh, I've got a girl She's as pretty as a picture She's the best pal In the world [Piano stops] [slow clapping] hello, Nan. Sorry, Jimmy. could you give us 5 minutes? Tommy, 5 minutes. MAN: AII right! Top of the bill, I see. charlie Frobisher's done you proud. Do you remember when you first came to see me, I wonder? What do you want, Kitty? You haven't forgotten me, then? I was afraid you might have. well, I wanted to see you again, of course. Nan, if you knew how I tried to find you. It was as though you'd vanished off the face of the earth. I was afraid you might have... have harmed yourself. It was you that harmed me, Kitty. I'm so sorry, Nan. It doesn't matter now. No. No. I can see. You're doing ever so well. And you--are you still married to waiter? You heard about that? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I am, but after a fashion, if you know what I mean. It's what you might call a-- a marriage of convenience. Nan, so long, I've thought about what I might say if I ever found you. I must-- I must tell you-- I'm not sure I want to hear it. would you come back to me, Nan? Oh! Aren't you forgetting you're a married woman? Oh, that needn't matter. WaIter's very good. He lets me do very much as I Iike. well, if we were only a little carefuI-- No! We were always careful because you wanted it that way. You were always haIfhearted, Kitty, and I was all for you. And now I've found someone who's all for me. She isn't me, though, is she, Nan? No. She's very different from you. Nan... I made a mistake with waiter. If you were to come back to me, I would leave him. It would be just you and me. I'II make it all up to you, Nan. I promise. I've never stopped loving you, Nan. You broke my heart, Kitty. well, won't you let me see if I can't mend it again? My mermaid. You need time to-- to think about it. I shan't beg you, Nan. You let your heart tell you what's right. I'II come to the show on Monday. until then... good-bye. [Humming] [Faint singing] Penny for your thoughts. [Door opens and closes] RALPH: That's torn it. The rally's off. The marquee company won't let us have the tents. Won't have no truck with political revolutionaries, so that's that. Oh, ralph, we can't just give up just like that. well, what else are we to do? well, the theater's dark on Sundays. You could hold your meeting there. Oh, Nan, do you think you could wrangle it for us? I think charlie Frobisher would do more than that to keep me happy. Nan, you're a tiptopper, you are! I beg your pardon. They call it enterprise and capitalism, but what is it, really? What is it... uh, reaI--reaIIy? BOTH: Robbery, swindling, and slavery! Robbery, swindling, and slavery! [gavel pounds] MAN: Quiet, please. I give you ralph Banner. [Pounds gavel] Go on. You'II be fine. [applause] Oh, Lord. [softly] L-I-Iadies and gentlemen... [Baby gurgIes] RALPH: Why socialism? That is the question I've been invited to discuss with you this afternoon. MAN: Speak up! [Booing and jeering] Why socialism? I shall keep my answer rather brief. MAN: Thank God for small mercies! [Laughter] [Murmuring] MAN: Oh, come on. Shh! RALPH: How many times have you heard economists say that england is the richest country in the world? [Loud booing] [ralph continues indistinctIy] I can't bear this. Nor can I. MAN: Order, ladies and gentlemen. Order, please. NAN: AII right, ladies and gentlemen. Why socialism? [Crowd silences] We'II tell you why. Because we've been robbed and cheated long enough! Haven't we, Mr. Banner? Yeah. Yeah, we have. How old are we likely to be when we die? Do you know that? What's the average age of death in bethnal Green? Mr. Banner knows. Don't you, Mr. Banner? 29. tell them. 29. 29! And your rich man lives to 70! [applause] And all this in the richest city on Earth. [whistles] And they call it progress... but what do we call it, Mr. Banner? We call it a disgrace! Yeah! Yeah! [Cheering] And--and it is a disgrace, and we want an end to it. What is the rich man's wealth but robbery under another name? Is it right that babies should die for want of milk? No! No! [Cheering] Join unions... Thank you! [Cheering and applause] Like a mermaid. [Heavy breathing] Oh, Nan. I do love you... so very much. MAN: This is your beginners call, ladies and gentlemen. Beginners, please! [Crowd murmuring] [Knock on door] MAN: 5 minutes, Miss King. [FROBISHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ...triumphant return to the London stage of Miss Nan King! [Cheering and applause] hello again. Remember me? There's a Iot of things that have happened since you and I last met. I've been up, and I've been down, but here's the best thing yet: if all good things around us are sent from Heaven above, they've sent me down an angel. I can't help it. I'm in love [applause] I've got a girl She's as pretty as a picture She's the best pal in the world She's not the kind who'd let you down She's the sweetest little lollipop in London town [Crowd oohing] She's a dear, she's a darling [/I] She's a little bit of Heaven She's a diamond, she's a ruby She's a pearl Oh, I've got a girl She's as pretty as a picture She's the best pal in the world I've had a funny sort of Iife With lots of ups and downs I've worn a Iot of different sorts of hats [Cash register rings] I've trudged the streets of London Not a penny to my name Next day, a toff in topper, cane, and spats I've seen a Iot of pretty girls A Iot of plain ones, too I've felt the prick of naughty Cupid's dart I've known some girls Whose kisses could leave you black and blue And one or two could fairly break your heart But now I think it's time I settled down And built myself a cozy little nest To share with the sweetest girl in London town The one that I Iove best CROWD: Aww. Oh, I've got a girl She's as pretty as a picture She's the best pal in the world She's not the kind who'd let you down She's the sweetest little lollipop in London town She's a dear, she's a darling [/I] She's a little bit of Heaven She's a diamond, she's a ruby She's a pearl Oh, I've got a girl She's as pretty as a picture She's the best pal In the world [Music stops] [Cheering and applause] [applause stops] [Drum roll stops] [applause] NAN, VOICE-OVER: I had come so far from the days when I was a girl, standing on this beach, wondering why I didn't care for Freddy like I should. And here I am again. And though I shan't stay long, there's a part of me will always belong here in WhitstabIe, where they have the best oysters in the world. shall we go, then? Have you got your courage up? Are you ready to meet the family? If you are. MAN: It's only human nature after all [applause] Captioning made possible by Acorn Media Captioned by the national Captioning Institute [Indistinct chatter] Woman, voice-over: Did you ever go to whitstable and see the oyster parlors there? My father kept one. I was born in it. That's my sister alice. She was a good girl, alice, and my best friend as well as my big sister. That's my father. Best WhitstabIe natives you'II ever taste. Right you are, sir. Coming. But this isn't about him or alice or my brother Davy or my mother. It's about me, Nan AstIey, and I was nothing then. I was barely 18. My life had hardly started. But open an oyster, and it's like a secret world in there, and that's how it was with me. I didn't see how my Iife could have any surprises waiting in it. I suppose I was content with my oyster girl's existence. AII right then, Nan. hello, Freddy. Go for a little walk, then? Yes, all right, then. I don't mind. Nan, voice-over: That was our little routine. I'd meet him when they brought the boat in, and we'd go for a little walk... and a little spooning. We weren't what you'd call "fast." It was expected, really, but... I never knew how I was supposed to feel. [Singing with piano] Tony Reeves was sweet on alice. He was undermanager at the Canterbury palace of Varieties. Mother thought him a bit rapid, but you couldn't not Iike him. [Reeves speaks indistinctIy] Ding-dong, ding-dong! [Laughter] I heard that from gully SutherIand himself. Hey, you mustn't miss his show next week. It's a stunner! I'II get you in the circle for gallery price. That's very kind of you, Mr. Reeves. Tony! Tony! We know each other well enough by now. well, we should love to come. Is it all right if Nan's Freddy comes along, too? Reeves: Of course. The more the merrier. He's not "my" Freddy, Mother. He isn't yet, but he'd Iike to be. Is that about the shape of it? [Drum roll] [whistles] Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, a very special treat. For those of you who are connoisseurs of elegance and top cIass-- [Laughter] Miss Kitty butler! [applause and cheering] What do you think? Pretty smart? Not half bad, I should say. I'm following in Father's footsteps, following me dear, old dad. He's just in front with a fine, big gal, So I thought I'd have one as well. [Soft, indistinct singing] Oh, Rosie. Dear Rosie. There's a rose in my heart... for you. I. There and back in this very submarine How come your not a rich man They wouldn't let him return The scaley's didn't like the idea of having their sacred place found so they confiscated his journal burned it to ashes and locked him away But before he died he pulled me up very close and said to me "Dennison also kept a journal " I've spent my whole life searching for that journal After he died they found hundreds of small notes They all said the same thing "l found it!" Sunstones! Block it, boys, block it! Come on! You have to go faster than that With out the prime sunstone all the others will fail This maybe the end for Dinotopia What are we to do? The citizens are already gathering in Fountain Square by the Opilish codes Well you lead the city in a prayer of hope Of course, but why me? The sunstone I gave you was small but it was an almost perfect gem Show it to the city It will bring hope and then we can take it to the Sunstone Tower and perhaps it will bring back the light for one night at least I don't have it anymore I gave it to David and Karl to power the submarine You gave those two the most flawless sunstone ever found I thought it was the Dinotopian thing to do I only hope it was worth all our lives, Marion Maybe we should turn on a light and see where we are And we'll drain the power We don't want it to soon What was that? The sea bed boys We're making progress It's getting really hot in here And hard to breathe That's our plane Prepare yourself for an ugly sight boys There won't be much left of him by now The fish would... If you don't shut up I am going to hit you Seen a few drowners in my time That's all I'm saying no offence to the died It's empty! What? It can't be There it is boys We have got to hit the entrance just right Come on Fresh air! Finally! Come on boys no time to waste Welcome to the south entrance to the World Beneath This is Ogthar Half man, half scaley Founder of Poseidos If you believe that kind of rubbish So how do you get half-man half-dinosaur? I don't think it's meant to be literal It's symbolic Humans and dinosaurs sharing the same thoughts and desires Living together in perfect harmony I'm with Karl on that one All looks a bit mucky to me You can't just dismiss an amazing agricultural discovery because it looks "a bit mucky" Once a scaley always a scaley Path splits up ahead Let's have a look at Dennison's journal Okay "We walked almost a mile underground due south... "lt was back the way we'd come under the mainland and I began to realize that the World Beneath ran the length and breath of Dinotopia... I followed left for a hundred feet and then came to - the old North Gate where the Code of Dinotopia was first carved into solid rock..." Over there! This is where the monument in Fountain Square came from So that must be the code The first three letters were F-l-N- Well that's a -D. F-l-N-D Find the light Look at this boys Look at that! They carved their whole history of? our history It's all right here This is one of those theories, right? That dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor And the meteor caused a tidal wave- It looks like the end of the world... Well that must be the sunstone cave It became like some kind of ark It saved them. Scaley history Come on, we're near The ancient scrolls warned us of such a time But we must not give up hope Marion Maybe when we least expect it help will come Sunstone fragments! This must be it We're looking for something a bit bigger than that, pal This way But the journal says Dennison walked due north about a quarter of a mile That's north But he stayed on the main path didn't he? Come on Maybe we should split up we'll cover more ground that way That's right. Lets all split up And if you get lost how are you going to find your way back? I say we follow the main path Alright. Come on I think we are lost No need for that Come look what I found This is it we found the light This is it This is everything It's unreal, is it not? It looks like something from another planet Of course your right The temple pictures make sense now The dinosaurs didn't find the sunstone cave The meteor that hit the earth that is the Sunstone Cave Come on boys. Lets get all these loaded Time is running out for our friends upstairs It's the end, isn't it? I believe it is I've always said I would never seek another partner after the death of my beloved But if I ever was it could only be you I am. And always will be your truest friend Breath deep, ZlPEAU Seek peace, Marion Hurry up. Hurry up Careful That should do it boys You know I don't think we can take all of these Cyrus, we're too heavy He's right, it's too dangerous You're going to have to make a second trip I don't think she has a second trip in her Something will have to go What do you mean? Well let me put it his way I don't want to risk loosing our precious cargo So something will have to go But I don't think it will be the sunstones You can't be serious I'd like to thank you gentlemen for all your hard work But if you'll excuse me I'll be taking my leave Cyrus, you are not leaving us down here Davie What are you going to do? It's... I knew we couldn't trust you A little boxing match, yeah? Well I don't think so Because I'm a street fighter and I always win Dad? Dad!

Good idea Hope you enjoy your family reunion cheerio! How did you get here? I saw you drown I nearly did drown I finally managed to break free When the plane hit the ocean floor I thought I was swimming for the surface but I came out here instead What did you do for food? All in good time.. I'll tell you everything... First off I want to hear about you two There's plenty of time to hear about me Sorry, did I hurt you? Are you okay? I can't believe it seeing you both again its like magic When I heard your voices, I thought.. this is it, I've gotten weak I'm beginning to hallucinate.. this is the end.. Well you kind of surprised us, too Dad. We thought... God I missed you. Missed you too. Both of you... You've changed... but you're different... and look at you, David... I couldn't believe it...

No damnit! ... I just don't have the strength I used to have Are you alright? Yeah Now all we have to do is get out of here Yeah but how are we going to do that? Cyrus just took the only way out Well, he's not going very far Not without any gas ARRGH! Oh no, not like this.. Well that's it then. No more Cyrus And no more boat There must be another way out of here By the sacred code, Pteranodons Everyone gather together Come on, stay with me Come on. keep up, keep up Come on get in, get in, get in Oliver! Karl, I told you, I already looked Dennison and Lee Crabb left the same way they came in the submarine There was nothing in the journal about any other way out That doesn't mean there isn't one Dad, how much of this place have you seen? How much have I seen? I don't know I've walked maybe two three hundred miles in these caves it's hard to say Some of them I couldn't get through because of the bats but No, there's no way out... None...trust me... I would have found it by now if there was Dad? Is there another way out of this place? This is it Wait a minute This is the flare I dropped into the well, remember Right so... Temple in the swamp This must be the other end We can get out! Well that's great Dad what's wrong? Must be hundreds of feet to the surface... The way I see it we don't have a choice He's right we don't You go ahead, bring back help What are you talking about? There is no other way of getting back This is our last chance. There is no way I'm going into the water again I can't do it Yes, you can We can't go without you I can't do it.. Listen I'm scared, OK It's the simple truth I can't.. I'm scared Dad.. you never get scared Would you listen to me! I can't go back into the water. OK! I don't think you have any idea to come this close to drowning I don't ever want to go through that again OK, I can't Dad, Dad look at me, look at me You spent all that time alone in the dark thinking you'd never see or hear another human being again That would break most men Not you You survived and you held on And I think you're the bravest man I've ever known Now this, it's nothing to what you went through And this time we can get through it together Alright Here You can hold your breath for longer than any of us. Remember? This will light the way We can do this. Right We'll just count to three and then take a deep breath. OK? OK One... Two, Three! Karl? Are you OK?

Excuse me we need to get to a place called Waterfall City Waterfall City the next bus is at dawn Dawn? Great. Now what David... you asleep? What do you think? How can a place like this really exist without everybody knowing about it Its mind blowing I don't know David I don't have any answers But I do know we have to get out of this dump Get to that city Crabb talked about Waterfall City? Exactly, we can find some help there get search parties out, call home Do you really think some place called Waterfall City is going to have telephones? What do you mean? I think the rules here are different and we better start learning them No, no! Screw the rules I'm not forgetting about dad Nobody's forgetting about Dad There's just nothing we can do right now not until we understand this place I don't want to understand this place I want to get home Look, right now we sleep, OK?

Betta hurry, over there Great - thank you Hey - That should do ya Excuse me, uh, hi, my name's Karl this is my brother Davey It's David, hi Hello, my name's Marian You were pretty impressive the yesterday dealing with that... whatever it was Ankylosaurus Weren't you scared? I'm studying to be a leader I must be calm in a crisis if I'm expect to inspire others You're not from around here,are you? Um, no. Not exactly We had an accident and swam to Now we are trying to get to Waterfall City Oh, that's my destination Now I understand what's happened to you But don't be afraid you are not the first When you arrive in Waterfall City everything will be explained just as soon as you register Register? We don't want to register for anything We just want to get home I imagine that so... this way This is the bus? He's a brach - a brahiosaurus We will be travelling with him across the Rainy Basin What's that for? Armor, that's to stop him from getting killed He says he much appreciates the protection The bus is secure We will be leaving in 5 minutes Waterfall City direct He won't eat us, will he? Brach's are plant eaters To get to Waterfall City we have cross the rainy basin it's the domain of the carnivores We only cross when it's absolutely essential and then only in a convoy But don't worry We carry extra food to appease them Appease them? The carnivores are not evil there just hungry by nature So,do you have any weapons? We won't fight the carnivores He means if they attack us I understand Dinotopians don't carry weapons Weapons are enemies to their even to their owners Third code of Dinotopia Wait a minute you have a law that says you can't defend yourself? There are ways to defend yourself without using weapons And besides it's only one in five convoys that are attacked Oh, good Now I'll just complete this hideous picture for us Exactly what kind of dinosaurs are we likely to encounter? Tyrannosaurus Rex, of course Of course Of course... What's happening? why are we stopping? The brachs something's scaring them Where's he going? What is it? Tyrannosaurus These droppings are fresh And the tracks there are hundreds of them I've never anything like it Dinosaur's never hunt in herds These ones did There's a small outpost at the edge of the forest We have got to make sure their safe come on What's happened here? Where is everybody? Look What is it? The sunstone has failed What's a sunstone? It's our source of power keeps the outposts and settlements safe This one's dead What is it? Quiet What's going on? Must have been the thunder We should get back to the brachs We can't The next outpost is more than 5 hours away The brachs will never carry us through the storm Then we'll have to find shelter here Would you like something to eat That would be great Yeah, I'm starving Any chance of a steak... a burger... or some chicken You want a bird... to eat? We eat only fruits and vegetables in Dinotopia And you do you eat meat? ME? No, no I'm a very strict vegetarian Why thank you Ugh, it's bitter You're supposed to peel it first See you haven't lost your touch Karl Awh, Karl, has a restless spirit Has he always been that way? Yeah, I guess so I've never spent this much time with him before You're brothers but you don't live together No, no we hardly see each other at all We have different mothers See my father he had a very active social life We were born just a few months apart but we didn't grow up together We just don't have anything in common so we're not exactly best friends I'm sorry about your father. David Thank you Did you hear that? They're harmless Creatures of the rainy basin Well something's making them panic Something's making me panic We should all try to get some sleep Karl Karl Karl What is it now? I swear I heard something It was like a rumble coming through the floor So go back to bed Let's check it out OK What? Can you see anything? No, nothing but jungle out there I thought... ya know...well I thought... You thought a T-Rex was coming to get you Yeah Outside! Run! Run! Hurry! Over here quick Keep running! Marion! Marion! Are you OK? It's alright. They're Skybaxs they're here to help us I am Oonu Squadron Leader, Skybax Corps I think you just saved our lifes Yes, this time you were lucky I am going to recommend this bus service be suspended until further notice We cannot guarantee the safety of the passengers And you! Stop! No one ever but a rider approaches a sky bax These are not tame birds If you value your life, stay back I will provide you an airborne escort for the rest of your journey What happened to everybody here We rescued the rest of the staff earlier We flew them out before the storms came in but three people and their Triceratops patrol are still missing As yet we have no sightings I fear they are dead OK lets go Right. Come on, follow us What's the best way to fight those things? We don't approve of violence in Dinotopia Even when it saves your life? That T-Rex almost killed us back there Our lives are no more precious than that of a Tyrannosaurus Come on Marion, eat or be eaten kill or be killed... that's the law of the jungle We're human beings and that means we're at the top of the food chain We are recent guests on this planet The dinosaurs have been here for a hundred and sixty million years Mammals like us are only recent Look, I like my dog back home but he's not getting a driver's licence you know what I'm saying? You feel superior to them? Well yeah you bet I do But you're not Karl feels superior to everything If dinosaurs are so superior then how come they're doing all the manual labor? Dinosaurs take pride in their strength Well they're still carrying us around on their backs There's many things you can learn from a Brachiosaurus Oh yeah? Like what? Like humility Welcome to Waterfall City I've never seen anything like it It's a beautiful city like something out of a fairy tale Marion, your world map is a little off America isn't joined to Europe At the beginning of the Triassic period all the continents were joined together in one huge supercontinent called Pangea Surprise you didn't know that David Why are they all looking at us? There haven't been newcomers in many years You're celebrities The mayor of Waterfall City is coming to speak This is the palace Who's that guy? He looks like a clown with all those robes on Hello father Oh Marion I heard about the Tyrannosaurus attack I've been so worried I'm fine there's nothing to be frightened off but I would like to address the senate on what I saw Oh yes, yes Plenty of time for that Dinner's at eight Quarter to nine by the time the speeches have dragged on Oh well... Now on behalf of the people of Dinotopia I Waldo Saville the 207th Mayor of Waterfall City and speaker of the Dinotopian Senate extend to you all our warmest welcome and hospitality Excuse me Mr. Mayor? Our plane... crashed into the sea David and I, we escaped but our father was trapped in it What we need is a search party Don't worry, dear boys now the senate awaits you and we will address all your concerns Recorded on this scroll you can see those names of all the shipwrecked souls whom destiny has delivered to our land They number in thousands from all corners of the earth from every century Those poor unfortunates castawayed on the winds of misfortune only to find a better life a life of harmony fulfillment, here on the shores of Dinotopia And we are their descendents Welcome Please, please do sign Welcome to Waterfall City... David Scott And a very warm welcome to you to... Karl Scott Well we would like to formally except you into the Waterfall City Academy where you will, after training be given the chance to become full Dinotopian citizens and find your saurian life partner Saurian? You mean one of those scaleys? We don't use that ugly term here but yes you will be paired with a dinosaur There's a ceremony and we take a vow it's like a marriage Well thank you for the offer but we have to get home Our dad's still out there there's no way we can stay here We understand that you both must be upset but many Dinotopians have lost friends and families in the ship wrecks that brought them here but I'm afraid your past life is gone This must be a big shock to you but when you understand the truly wonderful life out here Marion, we have to get off this island I'm afraid that's impossible Over the centuries a few have tried but they've all perished on the razor reef But wait a minute how do you know no one's ever made it? Had you ever heard of Dinotopia before you arrived? No... Exactly Now you can't imagine how exciting this is for us you're the first new arrivals for many a long time and we're all waiting to hear of the changes your world Come on, come along Our last off-worlder was shipwrecked in 1944 So what have been the principal changes in your society since then? What? Oh yes, are you still at war with the Germans? Oh, no we won that one Well done You'll tell us about the significant historical events that have followed Uh...significant events let's see hmm.. there was the War in Vietnam and Watergate um the Gulf War the Cold War and that's when they knocked down the Berlin wall They knocked down the wall? Where's there something wrong with it That's a little hard to explain Lets see what else... uh.. Oh! the space program, Apollo 1 1 that's when Neal Armstrong walked on the moon Technology is very advanced these days We all have mobile phones DVDs and laptops Everybody's on the lnternet I'm sorry I think we're a little confused I thought you said someone walked on the moon? The most significant event in my history was falling out of the sky and watching my father swept away to drown Welcome to Dinotopia WOW! It's just incredible, isn't it? You'll get used to it I'm not so sure I don't understand how a place this big hasn't been found before it's not on any maps Is that so surprising? What do you mean? Are there no mysteries left out there where you came from? Well no, there's a lot of things we don't know about our world Well this is just another one This is the ancient library of Dinotopia This is your library? Must be centuries old Look at all these scrolls I'd love to read some of them You might find that a little bit difficult seeing their aren't English Oh... What's he doing? Dinosaurs hate turning pages they do their best thinking when their feet are moving Daretakalada Gosh, I'm sorry No, no, no, no it's perfectly alright It was completely my fault This dinosaur can talk! Dare-tago Dare-tago madam Marion. David and Karl Scott, right Um yes, I can speak English and French Bonjour mon ami Bonjour! I can understand 1 7 major human and Saurian languages and imitate many natural sounds I was at the top of my class So how many dinosaur's can talk? All of them But very few learn to speak English properly if that's what you mean How exciting it is to meat you! Oh, I just love mammals I have to leave you now I'm going to speak to the senate Good bye Well wait a minute where are we supposed to go? Where are we going to sleep? Oh, I'm sorry I thought you had been told ZIPEAU has kindly agreed to give you temporary accommodation in his house Yes Goodbye You mean we're staying with a dinos A librarian Right, librarian Yes Mmmmm, this is delicious Your fork Karl Very kind of you to put us up ZIPEAU Oh no, not at all I find you a very interesting species I just love the way you jump about very quick reactions and the way you eat with your little knife and fork cutting up all the food first it's so funny So do you have a human partner I was partners with Sylvia of the Hatchery But I was never sought another after my soulmate's death Wow, how'd ya score a babe like that? God... What? Babe? Hmm...very colorful language It's a spiritual union... I don't think you understand yet No, I'll never meet another like her... babe Dare-toe camada Almasoar Food's getting cold darling I thought you spoke beautifully to the senate I couldn't believe my little girl looked so grown up The debate was very interesting but the next meeting's not scheduled for another month Well the dinotopian way is the reasoned way A good mind is a calm mind Danad-you-sec Almasoar Father this isn't the first time the sunstone has failed and I've never seen Tyrannosaurus running in herds Perhaps the outer settlements are being attacked because the sunstones are failing Is that so. An intriguing idea I shall send out skybaxs patrols to confirm the reports before the next meeting Wow very cool We're in the nut house Yeah. I know. What a place, I mean it's just incredible And all that talk about partners doesn't it seem just a bit creepy I'm mean we're talking about lizards here No, I mean this is some kind of Utopia where everyone lives in harmony Yeah, well there's no way I'm ever going to be walking around with a lizard girlfriend As for studying "saurian" whatever that is you can forget it Why do you always turn against everything when we haven't even started What's the point when we're going home anyway? Oh, and how are we going to do that? I mean you saw what the razor reef did to our plane, right You know the more I listen to you the more I think you want to stay here Of course I want to go home but we don't know how to So,all I'm saying is we should make the best of it You really don't want to leave, do you? I can't believe it Think about it Karl, don't you see something absolutely amazing has happened to us No, I think watching dad die has kind of ruined it for me You know I didn't mean that Well I think I know Dad what would say He'd say this is a good adventure We should be exploring and seeing things no one has ever seen before Maybe we should stay just for a little while see what life is like here Maybe that's because you don't have a life back home Well I do, and I want it back Before your grandmother Oriana, died, she gave me this She said it wasn't to be passed to you before your eighteenth birthday What is it? Open it What does it say? "Find the light" A sunstone This was her greatest treasure The explorer Arthur Denison found it and give it to her at least a hundred years ago It is almost perfect Apart from the Prime Sunstone I have never seen it's equal Orianna knew you were special even as a baby... Marion, I would like you to lead the Sunstone parade next week Oh father, that would be the greatest honor I tell you my dear there is nothing that could make a father prouder She's quite nice to look at isn't she? Don't let the mayor catch ya starring at her like that He'll run you out of town She's not for the likes of us ordinary people I was just, uh, having a look around Of course you were who wouldn't on a wonderful night like this Oh Karl, hope you don't mind me saying that brother of yours he's a bit of an odd sort isn't he? Well we're only half brothers... never really been that close Awh, I'm so sorry that your father's gone Yeah, so am I I'll be saying a little prayer for him tonight if that's all right with you Sure Why don't you call on me at the shop sometime whenever you get tired of the scaley's trying to change you Breathe deep Seek peace I can't believe you just said that "seek peace" you give me the creeps Oh, grow up it's a greeting Others first, self last Others first, self last Do one thing at a time Do one thing at a time Awh, awh, here are your new classmates David and Karl Breathe deep David and Karl Seek peace No way I'm not staying this school's for little children Then you should feel right at home Oh yes, it's beginners class Forget about it ZIPEAU Oh no!

Eat to live don't live to eat Now, who know where we would find all the codes of dinotopia written down? ME! Me! ME! ME! Me! In fountain square Very good David What? I read it in ZIPEAU's city guide And a very special significance to all dinotopians Ancient legend tells how it was brought up from the world beneath Tens of thousands of years ago What's the world beneath? It's a mythical place where dinosaurs were said to have found sanctuary at the dawn of time... Rule Four... Give more, take less Very good You can see down near the bottom here that the very last code is missing All that can be made out are the first three letters "F-l-N" Nobody knows what the eleventh code is Anyone like to guess what the eleventh code might be? Find a way out of here Did you say something Karl? Yea. I have to go to the bathroom Do I need a pass? No, but tonight's homework will be on the codes Homework? Forget it Karl? Shouldn't you be at school?

Karl quits just about everything He doesn't know what he wants I think I know, sometimes.. but sometimes I'm not so sure You seem pretty sure what you're doing My mother's a Matriarch It's my destiny Is that what you want? How can you want anything other than your destiny? You do ask the strangest things! Well, suppose you don't know your destiny? It knows you You find each other, that's all Marion, if I...

I'm a little asthmatic I don't suppose they sell inhalers in Waterfall City? This is fantastic, I had no idea You don't have cities like this where you come from? No... I think we're allot farther up than I thought... This is what powers the whole of Dinotopia It's the most powerful sunstone ever found It's almost flawless What are they doing? Every evening the prime sunstone regenerates all the other sunstones across Dinotopia Come on it's almost time we can watch it from here So where do sunstones come from? All we know is that their very old Legends say they say they're mined from the World Beneath at the beginning of time The have been found all over Dinotopia but not in many years Good evening What are you reading? One of our course books. Why? What's it called? The care and teaching of humans And you don't find that sick? No. It's a very interesting book Another week and then I'm leaving Yeah? And what's the plan? I don't need a plan to know that I have to get out of here You've got a week to decide whether you come with me or not I mean what are you doing here? Well Karl I'm trying to study for graduation Graduation? What are you talking about, Graduation? ! We don't belong here we're not Dinotopians! You're getting brainwashed can't you see that? Look, I don't have time to argue with you, OK? Are you insane? There's a dinosaur sleeping in the next room Yes, Exactly! Karl, this is the chance of a lifetime We are the first in our generation to see anything like this They're screwing with your head, David and you just don't get it, do ya? Why are you so negative about everything? You know this is always what happens with you You're stuck and for the first time in your life no one's going to bail you out Why don't you stop being so selfish and at least get to know this place before you condemn it I'm going, and you're coming with me Look Karl,not that you ever bothered to ask but I kind of like it here I can't believe I'm stuck here with you Well it wasn't me who was flying the plane What do you mean do you blame me for what happened do you? Let go of me, let go of me If you ever say that again I'll kill you David I swear I will Mammals... Awh come in come in I was just closing the shop for the night You've got a long face on you No, I'm fine What is this? Awh that's Ogthar if you believe the legend he ruled over a mythical place called the World Beneath Some say it exists others say it's just stories for the children And what do you think? How can I help you my friend? I want to get off this island I see... well take a seat I was just having a bite to eat Everyone says it's impossible to leave They certainly want you to believe it's impossible to leave They don't want the rest of the world to know about their little paradise I don't care about their little paradise how do I get off this island? Well, I've spent the past 20 years collecting ancient logs charts, maps of the tides and reefs that surrounds this island There's only one more thing I need to buy my own ticket out of here but we'll never see it It's the captain's log of the Rebecca's Folly Well were's this captain's log? The archives in the Ancient Library But the only one who has the keys is that scaley they've stuck you with ZIPEAU? So, why don't you get it? No, no, no, no, no, no They never let me near that library on account of incident to do with one of my relatives Small fire a long time ago Nothing to do with me but just another example of scaley persecution But now come to think of it it wouldn't be to difficult for you to get a hold of that book You mean steal it? I don't know it doesn't seem right... and the scaley's are I mean they haven't done anything to me.. This is what they did to me... I was exploring a sacred temple when one of those ugly boogers took a great big chunk out of me That's what they do when they don't agree with you What do you think about that? You get one of these? Uh huh What's it say? It's an invitation from Marion Great. What for? Hello? Can't you read it? You got a big mouth anybody ever tell you that? Only you, Karl Here you go Thanks You're welcome It's quite fantastic isn't it? You'll scarcely believe your eyes The theme this year is the World Beneath So the world beneath really exists? According to legend it was the place where the sunstones were originally found the heart of Dinotopia Where's Karl? Sorry ZIPEAU look Oh, oh, look I'm so excited the show is about to begin Long ago a terrible darkness struck the earth The seas churned and the skies turned black and the light of the sun was lost from the land Our ancestors sought refuge in caves deep below the earth where they found food and shelter and magical stones which brought light A young girl left the safety of the World Beneath and climbed up to the surface a sunstone illuminating her way Higher and higher she climbed in the darkness not knowing that this was night Centuries passed and a great civilization evolved but no one had ever seen the sun Then the dawn came and she saw that the skies had cleared and that the sun shone once again Our ancestors followed her from the World Beneath and they brought with them the magical stones and they built Dinotopia The World Beneath was sealed and the great ruler Ogthar decreed that it should remain a sacred place undisturbed forever more It's beautiful... wow... wow Hi! I uh, really enjoyed the show It was a ceremony, thank you Yeah, well whatever It was a Saurian Spectacular! Karl, I want you to come back and finish the course Is that why I got an invitation? Look, I can't do school never have, never Why should I start now? Because you're not the person you want to be Oh and you are? You know it all, do you? If you can't bear school I'll spend an hour a day teaching you personally Really Okay.. Deal And in return you'll sit your footprint exam Your graduation question is "How are we to live?" You have an hour to answer in any way you wish You may begin ZIPEAU you look upset What's wrong? The most terrible thing has happened! A - They got to put her somewhere. - "They"? - You mean Pounds. - Mm. Captain makes the assignments. He could've placed her anywhere... vice, subpoena control. He's putting it to me. I don't dig it. - You brought iton yourself. - How? 'Cause I didn't back her fairy tale shooting story? No, because you slept with her. What if she files a beef? You could be in deep shit. Thanks for the heads up. Sir, have you seen this individual at all? Grace. Thanks for coming. I could use a drink. Yeah, I thought maybe you might. What are you having? Fat Tire, please. Uh, and Templeton with a splash, neat. No problem. I thought you were a Stoli girl? Eh, friend turned me on to rye... Kind of like it. Look, Harry, I'm sorry about this morning. You were right. I'm the original slow learner. Nah, you were having a shitty day, and I did not make it any better. Oh, come on. Waits, Stokes, Brasher... Jesus, Harry, could you digthe hole any deeper? Halfway to China.You forgot Pounds. Yeah, why does he have such a hard-on for you? Eh, it goes back before you were there. He was a lieutenant, ran the Detective Bureau... Didn't know what he was doing. Should've known somebody that incompetent was sure to be promoted. Yeah, promoted off our hard work in spite of his ineptitude. Templeton neat and a Fat Tire. - Thank you. - Thank you. To China. Ahh. My friend says that everything that happens was meant to happen... because it happened. - Deep. - Mm. Is this your rye friend or some other? No, same friend. Close friend. You are not the only dumbass in the division. I am... I'm in a relationship with a colleague. Oh. Maybe that's why I gave you so much shit... Mad at myself. Mm. - Let's hope your friend's right. - Mm. It's all meant to happen. Bosch. It's New Year's Eve tomorrow. Any plans? Other than finding you? No. Ah, I like your can-do attitude, Harry... Something else we share. What are your plans? Well, I do have plans. Well, I'd say more of a New Year's resolution. Yeah? You know, Harry, these phone calls, they're just not the same as face-to-face. I like to look into a person's eyes. Still, I'm... I'm gonna miss these conversations. How's that? It's time for me to go away. Go away? You mean to your magic castle? Oh, you know about that, huh? Sure. That's where Reynard the fox goes... to wait. How's that sump pump working? Castle a little drier? Oh, congratulations. You figured out my nom de guerre... finally. I'd beginning to wonder if you ever would. I'm getting off now. We also know about Maclaren. Is that why you singled me out... Dogs from the same kennel? When they put you in the trunk, Waits, how'd you do time? I did baseball stats. You're just trying to keep me talking. By the way, I know how you found out about the starfish. Yeah, I was proud of that one. I'm getting off the phone now. We're closer than you think. A bientot, Harry. So, we got another pic of the van from that warehouse. We got the plates, too. Unfortunately, they belong on a 2001 Honda Accord... Owner had it in long-term parking at L.A.X. You can see the driver's face. It's obscured by the visor, but look at that in the rearview. It's a handicap tag. Hmm. Said his mother was infirm. Well, we're still going through the Maclaren files. We're trying to narrow down the kids who both fit the time frame and spent time in isolation. Think they might've digitized this shit? We still have several hundred to go. What else you gonna do on New Year's? Excuse me. A-are these yours? No. Oh. Ah, they're persols. I found them. Someone's gonna be looking for them. I wonder if there's a lost-and-found around here or something. Oh, uh, I don't know. Oh, what a beautiful baby. Hi. How old? Six months. Oh, he's just a little guy. Look at him. Hey, you. We have an 8-year-old. - Aww. - Yeah. Yeah. They grow up fast. Be good to your kids. Yeah, that's what everybody says. Boy, that's such a relief... isn't it? ... When they finally fall asleep. - Give you a little time to yourself. - Oh, yeah. They do keep you busy. Yeah. Mm. No, it's downloaded. It I... yeah, I set up the account. Hold on. I'm gonna put you on speaker. Can you hear me? Yeah. Scroll through your contacts. I only have one contact... you. Well, click on me, and then click where it says "video call." Hey, I can see you. All right, turn off your phone. Okay. You did it, Harry. - Mom doesn't know what she's talking about. - What do you mean? She says when it comes to computers, you're hopeless. You're bruised. You should go see a doctor. I told you I'm fine. Can we please not talk about the accident? Want to make sure you don't have whiplash. Mom has so overreacted. Not only am I grounded, but she's monitoring my Facebook. Harry, the accident wasn't my fault. Yeah, well, Mads, you had no business being in that car. The driver was a minor, right? Not supposed to be driving other kids. Yeah. I messed up. I said I was sorry. I just don't understand why she has to torture me. Maddie? I'm talking to Harry. See? She won't leave me alone. When can I come and see you? As soon as I close this case. Dinner's on the table. Okay. I got to go. Don't work so hard. I love you. - Happy New Year. - I love you, too. Happy New Year. Hello? Hello? Oh! - Bottoms up. - Phew! - There you go. - Ah! 'Sup. Happy New Year, Pierce. Same to you, George. Yeah. How's that new partner? Good. Thanks. How are you? Ah, I'm changing tracks... going inside. Next D.P. is downtown for me. Planning and research. - You? Pogue job? - Uh-huh. Thought you loved the streets. Dead end. Nah. Command's where you want to be, brother. Here we are. Need anything that'sin writing, it'd be braille. - And if you do get an invi... - Hey, Barrel. - Hey! Happy New Year. - Yeah, happy New Year. - Hey, Renee. - Hey. How are you? - This is Marissa. - Hi. I love your dress. Are those peacocks? Oh, well, I have a thing for peacocks. Grew up in Rolling Hills. There were lots of them... wild. They make such a racket, people shoot 'em now... A peacock vigilante. That's awful. Well, it's just a fact. Lot of ruffled feathers. - How's Crate? - Great. He's busting out of the hospital tomorrow. - Ah. To Crate. - To Crate. Hey, guys. Get you anything? I'm fine. - Okay. - Thank you. So, he's getting out tomorrow. - He's getting out tomorrow. - Starting to talk... Just a minute. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Hey, sit down. Shh! Are you gonna be quiet? Huh? Mm-hmm. Ew. My baby. Oh, he'll be fine. Have some water. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey! Harry! I didn't think you'd show. How you coming with those Maclaren files? Oh, Jesus. Happy New Year to you, too. Happy New Year. Hey, beautiful. Oh, hi, Harry. Harry. This is Marissa. Nice to meet you. Where's Grace? - Yeah. - Grace. Oh. Wow. Alert the press. You're here. Mwah! Thank you. This is great. What's that? Behind me is the victim's car. Her 6-month-old baby, who was left alone in his stroller, appeared to be unharmed. He was taken to Children's Hospital for observation. Thank you, Tina. In addition, KCYD has learned that the suspect left a macabre note in the baby's carriage... Quoting now... "Raynard Waits wishes you a happy New Year." Motherfucker. Ms. Lyndon's husband reported her missing after she and the baby failed to return home from an outing in Echo Park. Her husband says Ms. Lyndon frequently meets other mothers in the park, but today went alone. Waits, the self-confessed serial killer, - escaped from LAPD custody two weeks ago... - Where's Bosch? - Took off as soon as this came on... - sparking a city-wide manhunt and terrorizing citizens during this holiday season. What's he doing? Why this woman? It's about you, Harry. The last murder imitated your mother's. This abduction, it's related. How so? The woman in the alley represents how society saw your mother, as a prostitute. This young woman represents how you saw your mother, as loving and pure. He wants this to hurt. The four other victims, he left their bodies so they could be found. But this woman... no body. She could be alive still. I think you're right. I think it's all part of his endgame. I think he's using her as bait for you, Harry. Thanks, Eleanor. You'll be asleep when I get back. Sweet dreams, Harry. I love you. Security was heightened at this year's Rose Parade after the abduction last night of Heather Lyndon. LAPD chief of police John Tenzer has mobilized the department, putting it on tactical alert until the suspect, Raynard Waits, is apprehended. All officers will be on mandatory 12-hour shifts, with the deferment of days off and the recalling of off-duty officers. Mr. Waits' actions will not go unanswered. He will be brought to justice. Do you need this? I will help you. Do you see that? I put down mothballs, they still come. Please. Let me go. I can't do that. Why? Why am I here? I need you. I'm sorry it's so damp down here. It's been a wet winter. I got to make a call. The reception's not very good. Please! Nate Tyler. This is Raynard Waits. Okay. How do I know it's really you? Because the woman I took had a coral necklace. You could check that out with the police. She's still alive? I didn't call you to talk about her. You did a very good job writing about Detective Bosch... Very touching how you described his mother's murder. I-I found it very inspirational. Inspirational? I want youto write my story. Uh... Okay. I can do that. That's all you could say? How about, "thank you"? How about, "I'd be fucking honored"? Okay. Thank you. Like my mother used to say, "good manners cost nothing." You mind if I record this? Whatever. Just get it right. Surprised to hear from you. Exclusive with a serial killer... I thought you'd go straight to press. I know that you think I'm an asshole. I couldn't know Trent was gonna kill himself or that Waits would... murder that woman. 'Cause of what you wrote. Look, I don't want anybody else to die, okay? Call you on your cell or landline? Cell. You record the conversation? Gimme the phone. I can't give it to you. You know that. Be breaking every rule of journalism. Gimme the phone. You can't have it both ways. If The Times found out, I'd be crucified. What if he calls back to check in on things? He said he would. We'll transcribe the conversation, have your phone back to you in an hour. When he does call you back, tell him the profile is bigger than mine... Better, too. Keep him talking. See if he'll meet you. Hold on. I helped you out. You owe me, right? I owe you nothing. "My true name will come out in due course, "and it is a name that no one will ever forget. "I am the only onewho knows the truth. "I will expose and punish the oppressors and abusers. I have built a monument to serve as a reminder of my justice." He just go on like that? There anything we can use? Blase, blase, blip, blip, blip... psychosis on parade. Then he says, "my mother would take me to see "the Lady of the Lake. "My mother would say, 'you won't always have me, but you will always have the Lady of the Lake.'" "Lady of the Lake"? What is that, like a movie? It's a statue... Echo Park. Echo Park again. Heather Lyndon. Also pinged this number to a vacant lot. - In Echo Park. - Center of the doughnut. The night Waits was arrested with a body in his van... I don't think he was looking to dump the body. I think he was taking it home. Well, we got 22 Maclaren boyswho fit the profile, have the A-C 1-0-2 designation, and have some connection to Echo Park. That's five apiece. Let's divvy 'em up. "Mark Gill... Maclaren, '80 to '82." The Gill family lived on Scott Avenue. Let's start with this one. Hold on. David Harris... In and out of Maclaren '79 to '88, three years in foster care... Irene and Harlan Saxon. 4518 Lemoyne. We'll take this one. Bye-bye. What's so special about Harris? - French connection... Reynard the Fox... - Yeah. The catacombs. Foster mother, Irene Saxon... She was a French teacher. Okay. Thanks. The foster dad, Harlan Saxon, is deceased. Kiz pulled his death certificate. He died from mesothelioma. Asbestos. What Waits said. Oh, but here's the kicker, Harry. David Harris fell off the grid in '93... No public record of him of any kind after that. Then a few months later, in '94... Guess what. Raynard Waits appears. Mrs. Saxon, LAPD. Let's take a look around. Dead body. No shit. Waits said his mother died. Door right. Clear. Coffee maker's warm. Clear. Closed door left. Jesus! Ohh. Mn-mnh. Garage. Clear. Clear. Let's get backup here, task force... Tear this place apart. 6-William-22. I'm code 6 at 45... Shit. Rover's no good. I'm going back to the car. Do it. David? You better be alone... for her sake. I'm alone. Please help me! This is between you and me. Let her go. You said you liked to look people in the eyes when you talk to them. Why don't you come out here and look into mine? No, you come here. There you are. Here I am. Let her go. You know that's not gonna happen, Harry. Why even bring it up? Please. Please. Shh! We're talking. So, how do you like it? Your monument? Took me 20 years. People should appreciate it. Is that what you want, David, people to appreciate you? Don't talk to me like that... like a fucking shrink. Can't we have a real conversation, huh, for once? Sure. People need to know my story. I mean something. Do you understand? Y-you know the expression, Harry, "a prophet is without honor in his own country"? Yeah, I've heard it. What were your foster parents like, Harry? Had several... wasn't close to any of them. The Saxons were beautiful people. When they took me in, I thought I was done with Maclaren. We had some good years. And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back. You know all about that, Harry. You know all about the darkness, don't you? I do. I know all about the darkness. You know, Harry, I envied you at Maclaren. You were strong. You could defend yourself. You didn't take shit from anybody. You didn't let anyone take advantage of you. They're coming. Good. Let's get this over with. No! No, please! Ohh! Hurting her isn't gonna change anything, David. Why are you so fucking blind, Harry? I've tried so hard, so fucking hard, to get through to you. Why can't you see me? I can see you. No, you can't. You can't. They made me. They made me what I am. Do you understand? You get it? I'm the monument... me, me... - Aah! - And you. It's all right. F.I.D. needs to talk to you. Right. Jesus. Cannot imagine what it was like to be there, - you know, with him. - Yeah. But he's still dead. Harry, you did good. Bosch. Sir. Can you give us a comment? There's a happy man. I'm sure he thinks this buys him a second term. We'll see about that. Evening, chief. - Proud day for the department. - Yes, indeed. Congratulations, Irv. Good job. - Thank you, sir. - Let's have a look. You start working the media. Make sure they know the lead that broke this case came outof the task force. Bosch might be the hero, but we broke this case. Got that? - Yes, sir. - All right. Congratulations. You got your man. Go to hell, Grace. You think your pal Harry Bosch is out of the woods? He isn't. Anyways, I'd like to do a walk-through of the scene before we head back to the station. Is your league rep here yet? I haven't seen him. Well, as soon as he shows, we'll get on with this. Yeah, good. We found Waits. He's dead, isn't he? Yeah. I put him down. And the woman? Safe. Thank God. Eleanor, give Maddie a kiss for me, - tell her I love her, will you? - Sure. Good night, Harry. Good work, detective. What was that about? Waits' gun. Yeah? There were no rounds in the weapon. Suicide by cop... By me. What does it matter? He's gone. You have a long night ahead of you, detective. I'll let you go. Previously on Being Mary Jane... You need some rest right now. - Tell me how bad it is. We have got the best plastic surgeon in the country. You're gonna be all right. Did his penis enter in any hole in your body? David is almost like family. You're like family. Hm... ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Ugh, he won't stop calling me. - Look, let me show you how I get rid of my trade, girl, you know what I'm saying? All right, so go to a recent call, right? Okay. - All right?

Hey. - Lisa died? Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? I'm so sorry. Well, uh, you had Prime Time, so, you know, it's a big deal. - So what? Bigger than this? Are you kidding me? I would have dropped it for you. You know that. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I know how close you were. You must be so devastated, baby. I'm... yeah, I'm just trying to make sense of it all. Yeah. Well, I mean... I remember you told me about some of her issues, but suicide? I mean, did you think it would ever come to that? Oh, God... I don't know. - Oh, my gosh... Now, obviously, the circumstances were a little... different. But I think, knowing Lisa, I think she would prefer that we celebrate her life as opposed to crying over it. Would she, though? I mean, Lisa wants pageantry. Can we just drink, please? You know you're on your meds. - Not anymore. Oh, God, do you guys remember the time Lisa got drunk, threw out all her hot combs, bought a ticket to Kenya, and came back with twists? Boy, do I. My God, she wore that hairstyle out. That was a mess. She said it attracted lesbians. Do you know that when I met her, I thought she was a lesbian? Because of the twists? - No. She used to stare me in the eye. It was like very weird. And I heard that when lesbians are picking you up, they do that. What? Where did you hear that from? Some lesbian. - I did. Remind me not to look you in the eye. That was a thing. - You're crazy, girl. Oh, God... So, why was Lisa in Kenya? She had volunteered for the Samburu Project. They built wells. That was her way of giving back. She said, uh, "to whom much is given, much is required." We should invite them to the service. I think Lisa would really like that. Kara, can you... can you call for me? Yeah, absolutely. I don't mind it, you know? Anything you need me to do, Mary Jane? Oh... Boys and Girls Club. She was a mentor there. Can you... I'm on it. - For the love of philanthropy, how did she have time to do all of this? I can barely remember to brush my damn teeth. What kind of service are you thinking about? Uh, she was... Buddhist? - No. I thought she was Catholic this whole time. No, she just liked that the services were short and you could wear jeans. Unh-unh. No. She used to go to AME with me. No. She was just constantly searching for something. The girl was a Methodist. - Methodist? First of all, Black people don't kill themselves. That's what "They" did. I mean, come on, you guys. Okay, granted, we might have, you know, been suffering from a lot of other things, but we took pride in the fact that no matter how hard things got, we didn't do that. I used to wear that like a badge of honor. Me, too. I pinned it right next to my "Strong Black Woman" badge. We ain't strong no more cause we're dying off in plain sight. What happened to us? - Yeah, but you know what? That's the problem is that people see suicide as a weakness. It's an illness, you guys. I beg to differ. - No, it really is. Yeah, and the medications they're peddling are the gun. Exactly. - Not all medications are bad. Kara, are you serious? - Yeah. You know the numbers. How many stories have we done about serotonin inhibitors and their connection to suicide? Yeah, but the numbers also swing in the opposite direction, MJ. Not all medication is bad. Come on. In fact, we know, and don't know people that are functioning quite well on the best drugs their PPO can offer. Life is hard, man. Sometimes people need a little help to cope, you know? There's nothing wrong with that. I can't believe she's gone. Yeah, you talk to David? No. Why? Because he found her body. ♪ So, um... How's the funeral being... handled? Cause I'll pay for it. It's already been taken care of. ♪ So, you saw her? I did. Why were you even there... if you don't mind me asking? I don't. Um... I was checking on her because she hadn't answered my calls since... How are you doing? - Good. Fine... all things considered. If you need anything... - I won't. Thanks. We kill her. We wouldn't talk to her and she needed to talk. Hey. We killed her. - Mom. We did. Okay. Okay? That's all you have to say? No, Mom, that's not all I have to say. I have quite a bit to say, actually, about Lisa's burial outfit and what flowers that we should have at her service and, I don't know, who we should invite. I have a lot to say, and I have a lot to do to make sure that my friend is buried with respect and decency, so forgive me if I don't have time to co-host a pity party with you, Mom. Well, I've already spoken with her family and I'm sure that the arrangements are underway. What? - Well, they had a right to know. You know Lisa hadn't spoken to them in over 15 years. Why would you do that? Every mother has the right to know. Let me get... let me get this straight. So, you're laying here in mock mourning over the fact that you think we didn't do enough to prevent Lisa's death. But you think inviting the very people who planted the seed to her pain... It was the right thing to do. What does that even mean, Mom? People always say that when they do something that... that only makes sense to them, it's like when you're on the phone with a customer service rep and you're... you're trying to get a straight answer and they just keep talking nonsense and then finally they say, "Ma'am, I'm sorry. It's company policy." So... so... so... sorry, Mom, But I don't think inviting the people who... who helped destroy Lisa should be company policy. It's not right. Then what is our excuse? And I did try calling you first, but you didn't answer, remember? You're always too busy. Now I guess if I had been able to reach you, we could have had this productive exchange then. So, you're punishing me for being busy. Well, I didn't realize that making a phone call would feel like a punishment. But I am sorry that I was unable to reach you when I called you and it's caused you so much distress. Hi, Auntie. Still want me to come with you? Okay. I hear you, baby. I'm coming. ♪ You all right, Auntie? Auntie? Can you believe my mom? She went behind my back to call Lisa's parents. I mean, look, they can come. But that doesn't mean I have to deal with them. And as far as the funeral arrangements are concerned, I'm in control of that. So their input won't be necessary or accepted. It's all a shame, Auntie. Hi, Mary Jane. I remember when I took this picture. You all were in the third grade. We were in the fourth grade. No, this picture was taken at her 9th birthday party. No, that, uh... Alexis Hillman was bullying me in the 4th grade and that picture was taken on the day that Lisa threatened to punch her if she didn't stop bothering me... 4th grade. So, I think, um, to respect her privacy, we don't need to divulge the details of her death. I'm glad you feel that way. I, uh... I told the rest of the family she... that it was due to health complications and no one has asked any questions, thankfully. All right, well, I'll do a Facebook post. I'm sure that sounds tacky and impersonal, but in this day and age it's just the fastest way to get the news out before her service so she has a good turnout. Another idea I've been thinking over. You knew her better than anyone and so it only seems right that you would say a few words at her home-going celebration. Yeah, I don't... I don't know If I'm... - Mary Jane, you weren't the sister she never had... you "were" her sister. So, please? Please, say you'll do this? LISA's STEPFATHER: Baby, time to go! Charles is not coming to her service. Mary Jane, not now. It is an insult to Lisa's memory to have that man at her service. No! We put all of that behind us. Uh, Lisa apparently did not as she hadn't spoken to either one of you in years. Hey. - No. What are y'all in here whispering about? It's impolite to whisper. It makes me think you guys might be talking about me. Okay. Look, let's get out of her hair cause obviously she's got some issues. She's being very rude. Charles, we've all been through a lot. Look, it's either me or him, but I'm... I will not be at a service if... Hey, hold on a second. - I will not be at a service beside this man's ass, okay? You're not just gonna talk around me! Charles, please? Let's go. Why don't you let me know by 9:00 o'clock what you decide you're gonna do. ♪ Better hurry. He's getting away. She has to be there. People will talk, if she's not. Let them talk. You're so weak like that. I can't stand that in you. I can't believe you're letting this woman divide our family and dictate who comes to our daughter's service. I don't wanna argue with you. - Then don't. You always keep bringing all this stuff up, but you never wanna talk about the fact that your daughter was bi-polar with an over-active imagination. - I don't wanna do this. Look, she... Lisa was not mentally stable and you know that. She hurt us when she was alive. Now she's haunting us from the grave. I'd like to get her in there, first! I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm exhausted.

It felt so weird, you know? I got paranoid that, um... the longer... I didn't cry, the worse it would be when I finally did. So, I just... I just kept... trying to hold it inside. And I got worried, you know? Like... I knew it was gonna happen. It was definitely, finally, going to happen when I started writing the eulogy. But I just... avoided writing it. You know, I used to procrastinate writing something that really mattered to me. Instead of writing, I just... I just stayed up until midnight trying to pick out what dress I was gonna wear today. And you know how many black dresses I have. A lot. I remembered one. So, when I'm trying on the eighth dress, I just get this weird, intense pain in my chest. It felt like I'm having like a mini-heart attack. And I just... I just start crying. And... I couldn't stop... for hours... just... in my closet, laying on the floor, just crying. Cause Lisa had told me not to buy that dress because it cost too much. And she was right. Cause I got it for a cheaper price in another store the next week. She was right. That was one of the last times we'd gone shopping together. We just hung out like real friends and actually had fun. So now I'm here... eulogizing... a friend I had... barely spoken to... and barely seen... in the year... before she killed herself. She's in a better place now. I just realized something. That's the lamest cliché in the history of the world. I mean, who really knows if she's in a better place? Could it be much worse? Really? I'm sorry. I guess it's just hard to find the right thing to say at a time like this... for me, at least. For you, you always seem to find the right thing to say in crunch time, so I'm sure your eulogy will be perfect. Thanks. I hope so. I mean... I owe her that much... at least. It's not your fault. You know that, right? I'm sorry, what did you say? I just want you to know it's not your fault. I know it's not my fault! Oh, Mary Jane, I didn't mean to say... No, no, you never mean for it to hurt, David. It just always does. Why would you say something like that? I was just trying to find... - You were just trying to figure out how to get Lisa's money. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I wasn't the one who screwed her out of her money and her dignity... - Okay... - ...was I? First of all, I didn't screw Lisa. Are you really gonna use the Bill Clinton defense? David, we are in a church. I'm not using any defense. I'm just... - You're just... Look, I'm just trying to... What? - I'm just... Yeah, right. What? What, David? What? What could you possibly have to say, huh? What do you have to say? Are you trying to blame me for my friend's suicide because you don't wanna take responsibility for one blow job. At least I think it was just one. You... you didn't say, "we." We could have really done a better job by Lisa. You said me. God, you pretended to come here to comfort me, but you really just came to comfort yourself. I'm out of comfort to give you, David.

How are you?" I said, "I'm fine. How are you?" Cause that's what you say when you go to a coffee shop and somebody says, Hey, how are you? But I wasn't fine. I wasn't fine because, um... today, I'm burying my oldest friend. I realize... that I'm a liar. I'm a big liar. And a good liar. We all are. We're all just pretending that we're okay when we're really not. And it's not even like it's enough for just us to lie. We really expect everyone else to lie, too. It's like... we're all afraid that the whole world's gonna come falling down... if we're... honest with one another all of the time. I absolutely now believe that the lies we tell each other, that's what killed my friend, Lisa. My sister.

He might have too good of a hand. So what? He's there to catch a murderer. He's an addict. And you checked in with your sponsor? Why do I feel like I'm being interrogated? I need to put 200 on the Cardinals. I'm here to collect on a debt. $30,000. Jimmy, your bookie, came here. I paid him everything you owe. This-this was a mistake, all right? Look, I made one bet, that was it. I need you to leave. Jesus said, "Go and make disciples of all nations, "baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit." Amen. Brother Tepper has accepted the message of the Lord and has chosen this day to be saved. Uh, it's okay if I hold my nose, right? Do not resist, Brother Tepper. For with this water, there can be no death. Satan. Oh, Lord, please! Help us, Lord! Begone, Satan! Begone, Satan! Oh! Our kids get along really well, don't they? I wish I could say the same about Booth and me. Yeah, well, you did kick him out of the house, sweetie. Christine misses him so much. Is he still going to his meetings? That's what he says. Is the baby kicking? Mm, every time I talk about Booth. This is gonna work out, Brennan. Booth has a problem, but he's a good man. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Keep coming back. It works if you work it. Right. Yep. Booth. Yeah. How you holding up? I'm doing great. Just settled into my new place. Yeah, so... You know, I think it would really help if you shared with the group next time. Yeah, you know, I'm fine. Being here is good enough. Not really, Booth. There's got to be some stuff you need to work through. Come on, look, you've been my sponsor for years, right? I mean, you know me. All right? Uh, I'm trying. Sure, but... Tell you what, you know how you could help? Give Bones a call and tell her how good I'm doing here. That... that's good. You know it doesn't work that way. The only way to heal your marriage is to work on yourself. That means participate here. Share your story during the meeting. You know that's the way it works. Same time next week. Yep. Seems odd that somebody would dump a body in such a public place. Well, the only person who put the body here was Mother Nature. Somebody tossed the body into the river from way upstream. Isn't Booth coming? Uh, he had a meeting. Why? You don't trust me to handle things here? I'm just worried about my friend, that's all. So any chance of I.D.? Small brow ridges and sharp upper orbital borders indicate female. The pubic symphyseal faces suggest she was in her early 50s. Hey. Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss? Well, first of all, we're missing a left arm. Plus, judging from the jag marks on the victim's back, she didn't go into the water voluntarily. Well, it's the Potomac-- who would? I also found some unusual sculpting of the bones. Looks like someone took a power sander to the skull there. It's so smooth. It could be a sign of metabolic disease or postmortem damage. Or if the body was pushed up against a rock wall inside a strong hydraulics system. Like a whirlpool? Exactly. Yeah. Meeting go okay? It's anonymous for a reason, okay, Aubrey? I just want to do my job. Where's the arm? We're not sure. But if it's still in there, Nautilus Jr.'s gonna find it. Junior. Swim, buddy, swim. Geez. You'd think people would take better care of the only habitable planet in our solar system. Oh. Champagne. This is high-class living. It's caught on some weeds. You know you're responsible for this very expensive piece of equipment, Dr. Hodgins. I know. Look at that, huh? Looks like you're going for a swim, buddy. Great. Yeah. Whew! Yeah. Don't forget, you're looking for an arm. ♪ Bones 10x20 ♪ The Woman in the Whirlpool Original Air Date on May 28, 2015 ♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man ♪ ♪ That's odd. The flesh decomposition isn't consistent with the degree of sloughing. No. The pollution levels in the Potomac might account for that. They can be quite toxic. Yeah, tell me about it. Why do you think I just took a 40-minute shower? Man. The bone is badly abraded. Well, the sculpting occurred postmortem, so it wasn't caused by any disease. Hmm. Okay, then. I beg your pardon? Oh. I'm on your side, Dr. Brennan. When the benefits of one mate diminish, it only makes sense to search for another mate... Not today, Ms. Warren. Well, I'm just trying to support Dr. B. She's been going... I don't need my situation explained to me, Ms. Warren. And your support will not hasten its resolution. If you need to get that... I-I don't... Were you able to pinpoint time of death? Behold the aquatic caddis fly larvae. Based on the stage of the case architecture, she was in the water for less than four days. - Huh. - Okay. Wow. Well, the victim's face is too badly abraded to do a reconstruction. I don't know what we're gonna do, unless maybe you find an implant that has a serial number on it or... Or shirt. Uh, sorry, Hodgins, I don't... I don't see anything. Because there's nothing there. You see, it's what used to be there. Oh. I think I understand. This polo shirt is pretty torn up, but there used to be a logo stitched right above the breast pocket. Yeah. The thread is gone, but... if I can connect the dots left behind by the embroidery, then I might be able to recreate the monogram. You're a genius. So how was your conversation with Brennan this morning? Ugh. Sort of awful, actually. She really misses Booth. He's got to be feeling the same way. Maybe she should just take him back. If thugs showed up at our doorstep threatening me and Michael Vincent and it was your fault, I would do a lot more than just kick you out of the house. But if he's feeling all alone, if he feels it's hopeless... Then he should fight. Isn't that what you'd do? To the death. Oh. It's ready. Look at that. Thompson Hardware. Okay. It is in Arlington-- run by Ted Thompson. All right, I'll call Aubrey. It always seemed like Booth and Brennan were so... I don't know, so... solid, you know? That nothing was ever gonna tear them apart. Yeah. I know. Do you think it's this? What we do? Is it eating away at all of us? Yeah. Yeah, maybe it is. I love you, Angie. You should call Aubrey. My God. Leslie was my best employee. That explains why she didn't show up for her shift today. When was the last time that you saw Leslie Hodsoll, Mr. Thompson? Friday night. She closed up the register and then left, just like always. Can you think of anyone that might have had anything against Leslie? No. Everyone liked her. I even tried promoting her to assistant manager, but she didn't want the responsibility. Why's that? Busy social life or... She had a kid, um, that took up her time. A daughter. Courtney, I think. Uh, she was 20 or so. Two of them get along okay? I think so. There was this one time though, uh, about one month ago, I-I walked in on Leslie in the break room, and-and she was in tears. Turned out she was talking to her kid. Any idea what they were talking about? Seemed like normal mother-daughter stuff, you know. Uh, "I told you why I can't be there, but that doesn't mean I don't love you." Stuff like that. So you can't give me anything until the bones are completely clean? Yup, that's how it works. Any reason you're so impatient? Well, truth, justice; might as well throw in the American way while I'm at it. Mm. So you're faster than a locomotive? You know, girls don't like that. Tough crowd. Agent Aubrey, what brings you to the lab? Just, uh, following up on the case. And you couldn't do that over the phone? What can I say? I'm an in-person kind of guy. Me, too. You know, I would way rather go see a play than watch a movie. Right? It's all about being in the moment. Totally. Oh. What? Okay, then, uh, since you have such an intense interest in the case, tox results came back suggesting poisoning. There are traces of lead, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, selenium, even low levels of uranium radiation. Well, that's strange though, since there weren't any metaphyseal bands on the victim's long bones. Meaning? The victim could have been poisoned over a long period of time. So whoever was poisoning her must have been close to her. I'm gonna go tell Booth. In person. Later, Superman. Long story. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Sorry. I had some calls I had to make. You okay? 'Cause to be honest, you got me and the squints kind of worried here. Why? Did Bones call you or something? No, we're just all concerned because for some crazy reason we care about you. Okay, well, maybe you should be more concerned that we don't have a motive or a suspect. Well, we do now. Okay? Cam found signs of poisoning, which takes a long time to manifest, meaning whoever did this had access to Leslie over a number of years. Victim's 20-year-old daughter, Courtney, still lives with her? Millenials. Something doesn't make sense here. Mom is gone for four days, and the daughter doesn't report her missing? All right, let's go. Hello? Courtney Hodsoll? Uh, yeah. That's me. Can I help you? FBI Special Agent Booth. Here's Agent Aubrey from the FBI. Going somewhere? Uh, yeah, yeah, just... back to my dorms. I'm just collecting the last of my stuff. When was the last time you saw your mother? Um, about three weeks ago. Yeah, right before I moved out to go live on campus. I thought I'd see her today, but I don't know where she is. I can give you her cell phone number though, if you... I'm sorry, but we recovered your mother's body from the, uh, Potomac River this morning. What? No. No, you-you must have her confused with someone else. We're sorry, but your mother was positively identified. I-I don't understand. Would it be okay if we could ask you some questions? How would you characterize your relationship with your mother? It was fine. Why? No arguments? She didn't disapprove of anything you did? No. 'Cause she wasn't that interested. You know, I know she... she loved me and all. And I-I loved her, but... But? All she seemed to care about was her jars. Jars? Yeah. Yeah, I'll show you. She was obsessed. Welcome to Mom's world. You got to be kidding me. Whoa. Wow, I thought I was a cookie fan. It was all about the jars. There was rarely a cookie in the house. A collection like this must be worth a fortune. Yeah, I'm sure some of it was worth some money, but mostly it's just sentimental junk. Man, she was really into this-- each jar had its own entry with a photo, description, the date she bought it, how much she paid. Yeah. If she wasn't polishing the jars, she was cataloging them or going to collectors conventions. Come on. You got to admit though, how cute is that? Piggy jar? Put the pig down. Listen, uh, I'm just guessing that there were other people obsessed with these cookie jars, right? So did you hear or see any fights over these? Oh, yeah. Plenty, over the years. Any particular jarhead who had it out for your mom? I stayed as far away from those lunatics as I could. I guess maybe if I didn't, my mom would still be alive. These jars explain the poison. So, old ceramics contain small amounts of lead carbonate, lead chromate, barium, cobalt. If a jar's glaze was compromised, then the toxins could have leached onto Leslie's hand. Well, I guess when people get nostalgic for the good old days, they overlook things like carcinogenic glaze. Why cookie jars? I mean, you know, Star Wars figures I understand, but... Well, Andy Warhol's cookie jar collection sold for $250,000 back in the '80s. Well, there's continuity in collecting. I'm a collector. Wait, let me guess. Um... Grateful Dead bootlegs. I'm gonna go with... Pez dispensers. No, I collect the elements of the periodic table. Uh, high purity samples, no compounds or alloys. Where could you possibly get scandium? Russian mobster named Pebbles. Uranium? Uh, technetium? Radioactive elements are tricky, but I'm working on it. And I found a laceration to the tissue from the victim's right hand. Defensive wound? Possibly. It looks pretty recent. I'll take a gander at the metacarpals. Yeah, and I'll swab the wound and see if I can find some particulates. How did you isolate rubidium? Wouldn't you like to know. Picking up to go. Brennan. Yeah, it'll be just a few more minutes, dear. Pie. Comfort food. You getting takeout? Yeah. Eating here alone-- I don't know, I... Well, there's a seat right here. Come on, Bones, we should be able to have lunch together. Why not? Yeah. I'll eat here now, please. You got it, hon. How's Christine? She misses you. But she's good. Look, whenever you want to talk about me moving back... It's too soon, Booth, you know that. Well, I'm going to all my meetings. I have things under control. You're off to a good start. I'm... I'm happy for you. For us. Look, I don't want to make this a bigger deal than what it is, all right? I made a mistake. Is that what you tell everyone at your meetings? That it was just a mistake? You put me and Christine in danger, Booth. Bones, please. I promise... It was more than just a mistake. Here you go, sweetheart. Actually, on second thought, I will take it to go. Come on, Bones, really? It's too hard right now, Booth. I love you. Cablerecordsshow that she paid extra for high-speed Internet access. Yeah? Well, it worked. Look at these bidding threads. Leslie was winning these cookie jar auctions by milliseconds. Sounds like she was a major presence in the cookie jar collecting world. I feel so stupid saying that. Yeah, well, look at this. Four days before her death, Leslie posted a bunch of blistering reviews about another seller, Cheryl McMichael. Criticism from a respectable source could cripple a small business-- and it wasn't just online reviews. Look at this. Leslie was trying to destroy Cheryl across every available platform. Her blog, newsletters, the seller's Web site. And with Leslie out of the way, Cheryl could save her business. Wow. Looks like a motive to me. Yeah. I noticed an injury on the frontal and parietal bones when I was cleaning the remains. It seems as though someone tried to kill this woman before. There appears to be a glancing gunshot wound to the skull. And there's a similar injury on the right clavicle. Both wounds show remodeling. I'd say about 20 years. Wow. That could be why our victim's daughter never mentioned her mom being shot. She was an infant at the time. Perhaps she never knew. This injury to her prefrontal cortex could explain the victim's obsessive collecting. Well, there's plenty of collectors that don't have brain injuries. Still, a bullet in this location would affect the part of the brain that decides what is and isn't worth saving. It's the source of addiction. It's destructive, for the addict and everyone around them. Uh, please note the slight depression within the gunshot wound, suggesting blunt force trauma. It appears to be perimortem, but the trauma pattern is obscured by the hydraulic sanding. Yes. We should open up the skull to take a closer look. In the meantime, please work with Dr. Hodgins to determine the weapon that caused the injury. I can't believe that this McMichael woman's life could be ruined by some online comments. According to her tax records, Cheryl had a pretty robust business selling memorabilia till Leslie started bad-mouthing her. Booth. Yeah, all right, just slow down, all right? Speak English. Right, okay. Got it. So Hodgins found, uh, rust that was embedded in the victim's hand. Oh! Oh! Take it easy there, huh? Cheryl McMichael? Who wants to know? FBI. Special Agent Seeley Booth. This here is Agent Aubrey. My online consignment business is totally legit. I got a business license, I pay sales tax... Booth. Yeah? Look at this. Yeah. That's a lot of rust, huh? Just like Hodgins said he found on Leslie's remains. "Leslie's remains"? What's going on? Maybe you can answer that for us. Look, Leslie and I were friends. I sold her over 50 cookie jars. Really? It's really the friends thing that I'm really struggling with. I mean, these reviews that Leslie wrote about you don't seem so friendly. You really think I killed Leslie because of some bad reviews? Have you ever been on the Internet? It's the land of nasty, bitter people. I'm used to it. You must've done something to set her off. Sure. Yeah. She wanted this antique Babe Ruth cookie jar that I found. We arranged for her to pick it up, but before she got there, I got a better offer. Very friendly of you. The guy offered me ridiculous money. I had to take it. I'm a businesswoman. Who she hurt with her reviews. We checked out your tax returns. For this year. Yeah, business was down because there wasn't as much inventory. That's why I expanded into all this other junk. Which is covered in rust and some of which seems to have gotten into the victim. Take whatever you want and test it or whatever you guys do. I didn't kill her. She was my friend. I was gonna try and find her another one of those Babe Ruth jars. I was correct. The current in the river smoothed out the surface of the skull and obscured the full extent of the depression fracture. But by looking inside the skull, we can see the full effect of the blunt force trauma. Brilliant. Radiating and linear fractures are preserved on the endocranial surface. I should have thought of that. Yes. But you're here to learn. True. I also want to apologize for wonder if he could teach me? I wonder if he could teach me? I wonder if he's the only employee I need?

I take a power nap, and all of a sudden you are a master? Well, technically no, but when Mog destroys the humans, I'll be rewarded. Or Option B, Mog will fail and Jellica will make you an appetiser. [ Flit screaming ] I feel like a milkshake! MOG: Run! [ Red Ranger exclaims ] Rangers. Just in time. BLUE RANGER: We're not afraid of you! YELLOW RANGER: Come on, guys, let's hop to it! - Yeah! - Yeah! Maybe this will scare you. BLUE RANGER: Jungle Fan! YELLOW RANGER: Jungle Mace! RED RANGER: Shark Sabres!

Another of my warriors has failed, but it really wasn't my fault this time. I had a perfect plan. Yes, but as usual, you came up short. This time it will cost you! [ both grunting ] CHAMILLA: Dai Shi, help me! [ Chamilla groaning ] No one will help you. Your luck has run out. CHAMILLA: No! DAI SHI: I ask that she be spared, Overlord Jellica. She can still be of use. JELLICA: Most impressive. I think you've reached a new pinnacle of power. DAI SHI: Carnisoar. CARNISOAR: Yes. You have done well, Jellica. JELLICA: Of course I have. [ exclaims ] CARNISOAR: The time has come. These are my Shadow Guards. Take them with you and destroy the Power Rangers once and for all! DAI SHI: My pleasure. - CASEY: We rule! - We are not afraid of anything! You said it, Theo. They set them up, we knock them down! Knock what down? Where have you been, bowling? - Yes. - Bowling, yeah, yeah. THEO: Pretty much. LILY: Exactly, yeah. Casey bowled a turkey, so we were excited. Actually, it was a frog. [ Lily and Theo laugh ] I would appreciate if someone would inform me before you go on break. Casey, Lily, Theo, loft. - We're going on break. - We're going on break. [ sighing ] What do they do up there? CASEY: Did you see that frog whipping, RJ? THEO: He didn't stand a chance against us. Yeah, when do we get our master tattoos? Masters? [ laughs ] Not quite. What do you mean? We're fearless fighting machines. We're unbeatable. Confidence is good, but overconfidence is dangerous. It's time to go back to basics. - Basics? - Basics? But we've come so far! I want you to practise your stances. Now would be an appropriate time. Power Rangers, come to me. [ roaring ] [ training battle cries ] [ alarm blaring ] Face me, Power Rangers, if you dare. He wants a fight, we'll give him one. There's something different about Jarrod. The sensors are off the charts. Don't worry, RJ. We're not afraid of him. - We're not afraid of anything. - Let's do it! CASEY: Jarrod! I didn't think you were going to show. You and your buddies are going down. I highly doubt that. [ yelling ] [ Rangers screaming ] On your feet, Rangers. - Ready! - Ready! - Jungle Beast, spirit unleashed! - Jungle Beast, spirit unleashed! RED RANGER: With the strength of a Tiger, Red Ranger! YELLOW RANGER: With the speed of a Cheetah, Yellow Ranger! BLUE RANGER: With the stealth of a Jaguar, Blue Ranger!

DAI SHI: The end is near, Yellow Ranger. YELLOW RANGER: We'll see about that! Jungle Mace! [ yelling ] [ Dai Shi laughing ] Cheetah Jabs! DAI SHI: Your Cheetah is no match for my Lion. You are weak and will be destroyed. YELLOW RANGER: [ grunting ] You have some major ego issues. Bring out the Cheetah! [ roaring ] [ screams ] RED RANGER: Lily! BLUE RANGER: No! Come on. DAI SHI: Theo, always up for a challenge. BLUE RANGER: Jungle Fans! DAI SHI: Your Bats friend can't help you now! BLUE RANGER: Oh, yeah? Swoop technique! DAI SHI: Useless! DAI SHI: Fool! BLUE RANGER: I'm not done yet! DAI SHI: I have advanced to the next level. You and your pathetic friends are doomed. BLUE RANGER: What? DAI SHI: That's right. My evil is unmatched!

DAI SHI: So, we meet again. RED RANGER: Yeah, and this time, you're going down! Master Mao trusted you and you threw away everything he taught you. DAI SHI: Master Mao never understood the power. [ Red Ranger growling ] RED RANGER: Shark Sabres, combine! DAI SHI: When will you learn? I am unstoppable! Now I will finish this! [ groaning ] RED RANGER: With the strength of a Tiger, Strike Rider Cruise! Let's ride! Full throttle! Strike Rider, high speed! Attack mode, go! DAI SHI: What's next? YELLOW RANGER: Guys! [ Dai Shi laughing ] - Claw Cannon, engage! - YELLOW RANGER: Claw Cannon! - Ready! - Ready! DAI SHI: Oh, please. Stand aside. RED RANGER: Charge! - Powered by Animal Spirits, fire! - Powered by Animal Spirits, fire! [ Dai Shi laughing ] BLUE RANGER: What? YELLOW RANGER: But how? RED RANGER: That's impossible! DAI SHI: As I said, I am more powerful now than you can possibly imagine. Spirit of the Mighty Lion! [ Rangers screaming ] DAI SHI: Victory. Say hi to Master Mao. [ RJ yelling ] - RJ? - RJ? So, the Wolf Master returns. Why fight warriors when you can fight a master? DAI SHI: Why, indeed. But your skills are no match for my power and you know it. Surrender yourself and I'll spare your students. - RJ, don't. - No. You know what to do. DAI SHI: Seize him. [ Rangers grunting ] [ Camille laughing ] Wait, don't say a word. Let me guess. "Sorry, Fran, we were on break during the lunch rush "and now we have to go up to the loft while you finish cleaning up." Yeah, that's about right. Sorry, Fran. We'll make it up to you. Hey, it's okay. Don't sweat it. I've already apologised to myself, anyway. Where's RJ? I haven't seen him all afternoon. JELLICA: What do we have here? CARNISOAR: Well done. You are truly an agent of evil. JELLICA: A Pai Zhua master, as I live and breathe. Please, compliments embarrass me. I wanted to destroy him in front of you as a gift for my training. Whoa, I've never been a gift before. JELLICA: How sweet! We'll make a gala event. - Camille! - Yes, Overload Jellica. Make yourself useful. Prepare the stadium for battle. CARNISOAR: And what of the Power Rangers? Without their master, they're irrelevant. If I may, what if they find other masters, like before? JELLICA: They have already trained with the last three of Earth. There are no more living masters. [ laughing ] Guess we're not masters after all. We have to save RJ, whatever it takes. Yeah, but without a master, how can we learn to defeat Jarrod? He's, like, super evil now. What do you think RJ meant when he said, "You know what to do"? He meant, do exactly what he told us to do. We go back to basics. All the way back to the beginning. To the forbidden room! Hey, I'm all for it, but if I remember correctly, the room's empty. I don't see how that can help us. Yeah, well, we have to try. It may be our only hope. [ Camille laughing ] Well, well, well. First-class accommodation. I can't wait to watch Dai Shi tear your Wolf Spirit to shreds. You are gonna beg for mercy. Do you always treat your guests so graciously? Don't worry, it'll be a short visit. I may be defeated by Jarrod, but your master has made an error in judgement. What error? He underestimates the Power Rangers. [ Lily gasping ] Spiders. Well, we're here. Look around, there must be something that can help. Guys, check this out! That must be Master Phant in his animal form. - And there's Master Swoop. - CASEY: And Master Finn, but who are those guys? It's a gorilla, an antelope, and it's a penguin! MAO: Those are the other Pai Zhua masters. LILY: Master Mao! How can we find these other masters? RJ's been captured and we need more training. Yes, I know. But these masters cannot be found. They were destroyed in a great battle. They reside in the spirit world now. Can you take us there? We have to save RJ. No one has ever returned from that realm. It's a place unlike anything you've ever seen. Master, please. We can do this. We'll find a way back. It's too risky. I'm sorry. The answer's no. [ exclaims in disgust ] Wrong cell. I ordered the pizza. Eat it. I want you at full strength for my showcase. Yes, the big event. Is there anything special you'd like me to wear? Joke while you can, Wolf Master. Joke while you can. Come on, Rangers. Please, you have to take us. It's our only hope. CASEY: Master, we can do this. You trained us, and RJ picked up where you left off. We won't let you down. Please. We're not afraid. Once I open the door, you will be. [ Mao grunts ] There's no turning back now. [ Rangers yelling ] [ Rangers yelling ] Not exactly a vacation resort. It's another world of ghostly spirits. What do you expect, palm trees and hula girls? Guys, let's get serious here. RJ's counting on us. [ Theo gasping ] [ Masters yelling ] [ Rangers grunting ] [ Rangers grunting ] RILLA: You should not have come here. [ singing ] Power Rangers Go! Here comes the Power Rangers Jungle Fury Go!

At your service! [ snorting ] Keep the Rangers busy. Yes, Master! [ snorting ] JELLICA: Out of the way! [ Rin Shi Pig whimpering ] What kind of masters are you? You taught me all you know, and still the Rangers defeat me. You're blaming us? [ grunting ] [ Jellica laughing ] You forget your place! Don't make that mistake again. CARNISOAR: Still, he's right. What do you mean? We need to find a source of greater power to destroy the Rangers. Rangers, party of three. Your table is ready. Fran, you don't have to announce it to the world. Relax, Theo. I can understand her excitement. Thank you, Lily. Hot, coming through! Very hot. No problem! I can make more sauce. Theo, you were supposed to put on extra sausage, not pepperoni. Come on, I'll help you make a new one. Hey! [ grunts ] I just bought this! Sorry. I was wondering why a rag would have buttons on it. I think you guys need to be a little more considerate, like Lily. No, we don't. Lily's considerate enough for all of us. [ phone ringing ] JKP. I'm sorry. It'll be there right away. Guys, this order to-go was meant to be a delivery. - Don't worry, I'll take it. - No, no, let me. I want to be considerate, too. [ groaning ] RJ! Are you okay? Yeah, Yeah, I pulled a muscle yesterday, so... I'm gonna go upstairs and take a break. THEO: RJ. [ gasps ] Boy, what a strange place for a delivery. Looks like the wrong address. RIN SHI PIG: That's right! And for you, it's your last address! [ grunting ] [ laughing ] Do I have your attention now, Ranger? [ snorting ] My bad, porker. Appartently I should have delivered in uniform! Jungle Beast, spirit unleashed! FRAN: Lunch rush! [ beeping ] Casey's in trouble! Thanks, Fran. [ screams ] [ laughing ] - Casey! - Lil! BLUE RANGER: We've got your back! You're fighting a pig? And a pretty gnarly pig, at that! Let's tighten things up! Jungle Master Mode! Spirit of the Tiger, full fury! Jungle Master, Red Ranger! Spirit of the Jaguar, full fury! Jungle Master, Blue Ranger! Spirit of the Cheetah, full fury! Jungle Master, Yellow Ranger! [ all grunting ] Need a push? [ snorting ] Come on, swine! Savour this! [ screaming ] Claw cannon! Let's smoke this ham! Powered by Animal Spirits! Fire! [ snorting ] That's a lot of bacon! Animal Spirits, unite! - Gorilla Spirit! - Penguin Spirit! Antelope Spirit! Jungle Master Megazord! Spirit of the Shark! Spirit of the Shark, combine! Come and get it! It's dinnertime! [ grunting ] I'm smoked! All right! [ Camille exclaims in disgust ] Still smells like smoked ham. Poor Hamhock. But don't worry, Dai Shi. Rin Shi Porcupine has quills with special powers. [ grunting ] Let's hope he's got a good aim. - Go. - Yes. So? We must call the last Overlord. Grizzaka, bad idea. - I don't trust him. - We have no choice! Perhaps if we bring him back to life, he'll be grateful. Take the bracelet. It will guide you to the Cave of Darkness. There, the Life Talon will bring him back to life. [ grunts ] Be careful, or this will be the last thing you do. Good luck, girl. No use wasting this pizza on a bad delivery. I call that "littering." And I call that "feeding the birds." I call that - "considerate." - "Considerate." Hey! [ girl screeching ] Let's Ranger up! Things are about to get a little prickly! RED RANGER: Hold it right there! [ grunting ] Porcupine power! A porcupine! Yes! And with plenty of spikes with your names on them! [ screaming ] [ laughing ] Man! I'm not gonna be considerate to this quill bag! Lil, you don't have to prove anything! Cheetah jabs! Sharp. Sharp. Get my point? Look out! [ screaming ] Lily! One down, two to go. I hope you others are tougher than this one! Okay, take it easy. [ Lily groaning ] Rare? FRAN: Practically raw. Just like the last one. Can't you wait till you're done with me before you eat another sandwich? Sorry. I'm starving. [ Lily groans ] That's all I can see. Do you feel any more in there? Those things are poisonous. We need to get them all. No, you're done. I feel fine. Chill, Lily. He's just making sure. Don't tell me how to act, blue boy. All right, guys. Relax. I have some work to do. I need the three of you to help Fran. There you go telling me what to do again. I have had enough of your grief today. Me, I'm out of here! What's up with her? [ groans ] You sure that's just a pulled muscle? - FRAN: After-school rush! - Yeah, I'm all right. - You go on. - Come on, blue boy. [ groaning ] [ screaming ] This must be it. Hello? [ echoing ] Hello? Hello? Hello? [ grunting ] [ clanging ] [ gasps ] Yoo-hoo. Is anybody there? [ echoing ] Is anybody there? [ creature growls ] [ gasps ] Check for table five. Eight needs drinks. [ bike engine revving ] [ rock music playing ] Lily? [ crowd exclaiming ] She looks so, so... So, whoa, whoa, not Lily. GIRL: What... Oh, no! BOY: What's that? It'll put hairs on your chest! BOY: Come on, let's go. [ Lily grunts ] I'll take care of her. You guys go check on RJ. RJ! - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Hey, slick! Good Lily, bad Lily. I don't care. But no food until you get your feet off the table. RJ! RJ? [ TV static ] RJ? I don't care how sick someone is. It's not an excuse for not picking up after yourself. [ alarm beeping ] We can ground RJ later. Come on. [ growling ] - What is that? - Half-man, half-wolf? [ grunting ] [ howls ] Theo! [ grunting ] [ howls ] [ groaning ] Why'd he run off like that? Good. Just the Rangers I've been looking for! Hold it right there, spikey! [ yelling ] [ girls chattering ] [ beeping ] That's Theo and Casey. Aren't you gonna help them? Nah! They're big boys. They can look after themselves. [ scoffs ] More wings! [ sighs ] [ exhales ] Come on! LILY: Hey! Your check. - What about my other order of wings? - No way. Pay up and get out! Oh, yeah? Just give me one good reason. How about eight? Your motorcycle is illegally parked. Your feet were on the table. Your mood. You're rude. You're crude. The way you eat your food. Bad attitude. And the most important reason of all, your friends are in danger and you won't even help. You're so worried, you help them. Fine. I will. Hey! Those are my glasses. [ both grunting ] Fran? What are you doing to top of me? - You're back. - How? What am I doing in these clothes? You had another quill inside of you. - That's what changed you. - Okay, well, sorry for whatever I did. Hey, RJ. Wait, did... [ groaning ] [ laughing ] I'm getting tired of this! I'm back! Yeah! [ Lily grunting ] [ screaming ] Cool. That's better! My point! Lil! Looks like you guys could use a little help. You think? [ laughing ] Jungle Beast, spirit unleashed! Yeah! This is me! - Welcome back, Lily! - Yeah! Jungle Master Mode! Spirit of the Cheetah, full fury! Jungle Master, Yellow Ranger! - Guys, I'm sorry. - Want to forgive her? You bet! Thanks. Now let's get him! - We're with you! - We're with you! - Jungle Master Mode! - Jungle Master Mode! You're going down! YELLOW RANGER: Hey, you! Combine! [ screaming ] Had enough, spikey? You kidding? You've just made me mad! [ roaring ] Let's show him, guys! Animal Spirits, unite! Jungle Master Megazord! Spirit of the Elephant! [ trumpeting ] Combine! [ roaring ] Try and stop this! Jungle Mace, engage! [ screaming ] No! This shouldn't be happening! Game over! JELLICA: Well, the Rangers have learned to use their new power quite effectively. Where is Camille? She should be back by now. You know Grizzaka blames you for losing the Beast War. He detests humans. He says they're weak. You are now human, Dai Shi. Chameleons taste terrible, like an old shoe, extremely chewy. [ growling ] Wait! Before you eat me, I've been sent to bring you to the temple of the Dai Shi. [ roaring ] Is that a "yes"? You'll go? - FRAN: See you guys later. - BOY: Thank you. Have you seen RJ? Not lately, no. [ chuckles ] Cool jacket. It's kind of hot and squeaky, you know? Yeah, well, my head was a little crazy when I got it. "A little crazy"? Lily, you were the queen of mean. "Bring me more chicken wings! Hey, I don't do diet soda!" - [ laughing ] That was me? - Totally. "This pizza is too cold! How do I get service around here?" [ laughing ] I said, "Hey, we don't have burgers." You're not done. Have you finished the dishes? Grated the cheese? Sliced the pepperoni? - Well, we... - Well, we... Well, get back out there, and scrub the floor while you're at it! - CASEY: What's that about? - Guys! I'm just kidding! Let them work a little bit. I'm thinking maybe we should keep this outfit around. [ both laughing ] Did you see how fast they ran? [ wolf howling ] [ singing ] Power Rangers Go! Here comes the Power Rangers Jungle Fury Go! Training hard to be the best that we can Power Rangers! Protecting people from the evil Dai Shi clan We stand up for what we know is right We will never lose a fight - Dai Shi - Go away - We're here - To save the day 'Cause we're the Power Rangers Jungle Fury Jungle Fury!

Go! - Jungle Fury Grizzaka! You promised us a great victory. Where is it? We'll get it. My Barrakooza is battling the Rangers now. You asked for a spirit, one that could possess a human. You're giving him my spirits? They're my spirits now, Dai Shi. And now watch what my spirits can do. III winds, blow to the Wolf Ranger. [ laughing ] [ grunting ] [ grunts ] FLIT: Oh, goody! Another fight. [ groans ] What was that? RJ, is everything okay? Did we just get blindsided by our own teammate? It must've been a mistake. He does know which one's the bad guy, right? [ growling ] [ howling ] RJ, what's wrong? We're your friends! [ Flit exclaims ] The Rangers might have finally met their match, another Ranger! Splendid! I don't even have to lift a fin! Grizzaka will be most pleased! [ screaming ] [ screaming ] [ grunting ] I thought I had control over it. FLIT: Help! Help! [ Flit buzzing ] Help me! I'm over here. I'm stuck. Thank you. Thank you. You saved me. Hey, you're Camille's little motor-mouth. [ screaming ] A Ranger! Help me! Muffle the mic, dude. I just saved you. I'm not gonna hurt you. You're not? It's you and Camille that want to hurt people, not me. No! You think that because I'm always with Camille that I must be like Camille, but I'm not. I'm more like you than I am like her. Right. You saved my life. Don't you see? Our fates are tied together. How can I repay you, friend? Listen, I'm not buying what you're selling. Okay? I'm not even browsing! So just go back to Camillle and Dai Shi and leave me alone. [ groaning ] Flit! Flit! [ snarling ] Where are you, you over-fed sand fly? Nine thousand eggs, and I get stuck with the problem child. Flit! Flit! Flit! [ buzzing ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ screams ] I'm so sorry. I'll be right back. Just sit down. I'll be right back. I was so sure I had control over my animal. If we don't fix this, I could put all our lives at risk. [ Flit buzzing ] You can't morph, not till we figure this out. [ groaning ] - Got it. - FLIT: That hurts! No, put me down! Leave me alone! That's my wing! You've got five seconds to tell us why you were spying. No! Me, a spy? No, no, no, no! I was just following my new friend. - What friend? - I think he means me. My name's RJ, and I'm not your friend, little fly-dude. But you... I kind of pulled him out from under some concrete. Yes! You saved my life! So you saved his life, and now he thinks you're friends. I think that's so sweet. Of course he's being sweet, so we'll let him go. Which we can't do. He heard us. He knows RJ can't morph. - He'll tell Camille and they'll... - No, I wont! Honestly. If I had another chance, I'd rid myself of that loathsome chameleon once and for all. "Loathsome"? That's a big word for such a cute little fly. No, I'm not really a fly, any more than my friend RJ is a werewolf. I'm a human, just like you. But centuries ago, I was battling Camille, when... [ Chamilla yelling ] suddenly she cast ancient larva dust over me, changing me into a fly. Mmm. Feels good. Maybe I'll keep you in there forever. Ever since the day she cursed me, I've been a fly. Kept prisoner within Camille's yucky stomach. - Yuck! - Yuck! So, I guess you really know her inside and out, huh? Poor little guy. Maybe we can help break Camille's curse. Well, my new friend better get rid of that evil spirit fast, of there is gonna be big trouble. What evil spirit? Grizzaka sent an evil spirit into him, made his Animal Spirit go haywire. That's great! Then you didn't lose control, RJ. CASEY Oh, no. [ growling ] Look out! [ grunting ] Don't hurt him! This is worse than I thought. [ grunting ] [ Lily screams ] [ howling ] - RJ! - Let's go! Hey! Hey! Wait for me! GRIZZAKA: It's been 10,000 years since the last Beast War. CARNISOAR: Yes, that one didn't go so well. When I'm done, no humans will walk the planet. - Barrakooza! - Yes, Grizzaka? - GRIZZAKA: Continue your mission. - No humans? I won't be pushed aside that easily. [ chuckling ] MAN 1: Come on, let's go! - MAN 2: Run! Go ahead and run. Show me your fear. [ screaming ] [ woman screaming ] CASEY: RJ, stop! [ beeping ] Yeah, Fran? That overgrown fish has shown up again. - He seems pretty unhappy. - We're on it. When it rains, it pours. I'll go after RJ. You two have got bigger fish to fry. Be careful. [ people clamouring ] RJ! [ laughing ] Stop right there! You got lucky last time! Foolish humans! This time, I'll finish you! [ groaning ] What's the matter? All washed up? [ laughing ] No way! [ grunting ] - Fire! - Look out! [ screaming ] Enough of this! [ panting ] Time for the gloves to come off! And the claws to come out! BOTH: Jungle Master Mode! [ screaming ] RJ, it's me! Hold him steady! - What are you doing? - You'll see. Hold him! [ Flit grunting ] FLIT: Come on, RJ. Do whatever it takes! Pull out all the stops. You can't afford to lose. [ groaning ] [ growling ] If you don't get out of yout animal form pretty darn fast, you are gonna be stuck as a werewolf forever! Whatever you're doing, do it faster! [ Flit grunting ] FLIT: Oh, my, this isn't working. Wait, your Animal Spirit isn't your enemy. It's Grizzaka's evil spirit. Of course! That's what you need to fight! RJ, your Wolf Spirit is a part of you. It's what makes you a master! But an evil spirit has deceived you, made you think that your spirit is out of control. [ yells ] Join with the Wolf. Give the evil spirit no place to hide! [ growling ] [ screaming ] RJ? Man, I'm glad you're back. Yeah, me, too. I don't feel so good. [ groaning ] Flit, are you okay? Yep, just a little woozy. You? I'm great. Thanks to you. Then we're friends? Exactamundo. YELLOW RANGER: Firing jets! Back it up! Rin, Shi, crush them! [ Rin Shi guards grunting ] With the courage of a Wolf, Jungle Fury, Wolf Ranger! - RJ, you're back! - Indeed I am. My flea-bitten days are over. Strike Rider! - Oh, yeah! - Nice! Tiger strike! Strike Rider, high speed! Attack mode, go! [ tyres screeching ] Great ride! Jungle Master Mode! Spirit of the Tiger. Jungle Master, Red Ranger! Spirit of the Cheetah. Jungle Master, Yellow Ranger! Spirit of the Jaguar. Jungle Master, Blue Ranger! [ Barrakooza laughing ] Two Rangers weren't enough, and neither are four! See how you like this! Wolf Morpher, ready. Yeah! Jungle Fury, Wolf Ranger! The fish is fried! - Welcome back, RJ! - Yeah! Thanks, guys. Resurrect my warrior! Zokado! [ laughing ] You want a super-sized fight? You got it! Spirit of the Wolf, calling on the Animal Spirits! Wolf, Tiger, Jaguar! Wolf Pride Megazord! This Wolf's ready to rip. You want to change your mind? Now's the time. The Wolf Ranger is back in form. His spirit is balanced, but is he a match for Barrakooza? The beast is on the run! My new friend is one tough hombre! Enough of this! Fire! [ groaning ] Behold the might power of the Barrakooza Spirit! All right, let's give this guy a taste of his own medicine! Jungle Master, Fury Fists! [ screaming ] Spin Fury! [ groaning ] My friend is gonna win! Nice job! [ screaming ] [ groaning ] Hey, little buzz-buddy. You okay? This is all part of Camille's curse over me. I can't be out of her stomach too long or I fade away. - We've got to get him back to Camille. - Are you crazy? He's not like them. RJ, it's okay. I have no choice. Maybe someday, I hope, we'll team up again. It would be an honour. [ gasping ] Picking on a poor defenceless fly! Now that's really scraping the bottom of the barrel. FLIT: Please don't swat me. I wasn't doing a anything, just talking. I'm not going to hurt you, my little Flittery fly. Take care, Flit. [ blows ] You found it. Now what? I don't know, but I have to leave. The Overlords are already planning to destroy me. They say the Rhino Nexus has unimaginable power. Maybe there, I can finally learn to control my Zokado. I could come with you. [ music playing on stereo ] Finally. What? What are you... Give me that! [ grunting ] [ Fran shrieking ] [ fly buzzing ] [ grunting ] There it is! [ groaning ] [ crashing ] LILY: Oh, no! Did you get it? [ fly buzzing ] [ Lily gasping ] [ Theo shushing ] [ Theo yells ] [ RJ exclaims ] Chill out, dudes. Come on, little fellow. The restaurant's closed. He really needs to get over Flit. [ sighs ] (SIW GIW G) Power Rangers Go! Here comes the Power Rangers Jungle Fury Go! Training hard to be the best that we can Power Rangers!

Go! -Jungle Fury DOMINIC: (EXCLAIMS) All right. Hey, guys. How about a little powwow? This archaeologist has found five Crystal Eyes. Five what? Crystal Eyes. During the Beast Wars, 1 O,OOO years ago, the Phantoms were the baddest beasts around. But one by one, the Masters destroyed all eight of them, saving the human race. When each beast was destroyed, a Crystal Eye was left in the ashes. About this size. Tonight, the stars are in a very rare alignment. If the starlight shines through the Eye, bingo, bango, bongo. The Phantom Beasts are brought back to life. If Dai Shi gets his hands on those Crystal Eyes... We've got a whole army of Phantom Beasts to worry about. Precisely. But there are eight Crystal Eyes. She only has five. That means Dai Shi may already have three. Dr Silvia Jennings. She's probably got no idea what they are. We have to make sure those Crystal Eyes are safe tonight. (JELLICA GROANING) Only three Crystal Eyes? Keep looking! But we have looked everywhere. Someone else must have found them. There's no more time. Tonight the stars... I know what tonight is! (WHIMPERS) Go ahead, destroy Jellica. That's always been your problem, Grizzaka. You destroy what you cannot have. I'm here to take back my throne before you destroy that, too. You dare to lecture me! Your incompetence cost us the Great Beast War! (GRIZZAKA GRUNTING) (GRIZZAKA GROANS) What? (JELLICA GASPS) Do you recognise that power? Yes, it's Zokado. You're wasting my energy. I have Power Rangers to destroy. dal shi: Good luck. (GRIZZAKA GROWLING) GRIZZAKA: With Carnisoar destroyed, I must gather fear in the city, then return and put Dai Shi away before he grows too strong. JELLICA: Yes, Grizzaka. GRIZZAKA: (GRUNTS) Keep an eye on him. JELLICA: Of course. (CAMILLE EXHALES) (CHUCKLES) Home sweet home. Maybe we should redecorate, now that we're back. Don't get too comfortable. Grizzaka is gathering more strength. I need to get the upper hand before he returns, or he'll destroy us both. Maybe I have an idea. (RIN shi ARMY GRUNTING) The Crystal Eyes. Excellent. CAMILLE: But wait. I was doing the crossword puzzle, and five down was "a digger of relics." I turned the paper over, and there it was. "Archaeologist." She has the other five. The retinal scan was negative for crocodile. CASEY: Iguana. Pardon me? I read that you hadn't identified one of the Eyes. That one is an iguana's eye. I've been trying to determine that for a long time. I'm Silvia Jennings. How did you know? I went to a school that specialised in animal spirits. My teacher used to always say that everyone has an animal spirit inside. Really? My father used to say, "Live in harmony with your animal spirit, "and you'll be in harmony with yourself." Gentle, playful, likes water. Your spirit is a dolphin. Right again. Listen. I know this sounds crazy, but there are certain people who would do anything to get their hands on your Crystal Eyes. Why? The Eyes have powers. Powers that are dangerous in the wrong hands. What kind of powers? Well, I can't tell you. Okay, then, who's after them? I can't tell you that, either. I'm asking you, please, give me the Crystal Eyes. Just till the danger passes. (LAUGHS) You must be kidding. I've spent my entire life searching for them. So did my father. And now you're asking me to hand over my life's work? None of that will matter if they come, okay? And nothing you can do will stop them. The answer is no. Now, I have other appointments. No way she's giving them up. If Dai Shi comes here, she's going to get hurt. I'll stay and keep watch. Casey, if Dai Shi gets those Eyes, everyone's going to get hurt. Listen, Theo called. Rin Shi trouble. I have to go. Whatever happens, you protect the Eyes first, right? Yeah. Right. Okay. (ALL GRUNTING) Give me your fear, Ocean Bluff, so that I may destroy my enemies once and for all. (GRIZZAKA LAUGHING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) BLUE RANGER: Run! (BLUE RANGER GRUNTING) WOLF RANGER: I'm with you, Theo! Get out of here! Go! Go! Fire! (ALL GROANING) Right now we're digging for a Tyrannosaurus rex in Africa, and uncovering a pterodactyl in Peru. Which proiect were you interested in photographing? Dinosaurs are so yesterday. My real passion lies in the Crystal Eyes. Give them to me! WOMAN: Run! MAN: What's going on? (CHAMILLA LAUGHING) Yes! Dai Shi will be pleased. GUARD: Stop right there! Or what? (BOTH GRUNTING) CHAMILLA: No! DR JENNINGS: Let me go! (DR JENNINGS SCREAMING) DR JENNINGS: No! (CHAMILLA LAUGHING) The perfect diversion! -Are you okay? -l'm fine. But the Eyes... (RANGERS PANTING) -l can sense something powerful! -Me, too! It's getting stronger. WOLF RANGER: And closer. (GRIZZAKA GROWLING) WOLF RANGER: There! RANGERS: Grizzaka! GRIZZAKA: So we meet again. The fear of the city has made me even more powerful than before. (GRIZZAKA GRUNTING) Where'd she go? (CAMILLE CHUCKLING) dal shi: Show me. (dal shi LAUGHING) Oh, no! dal shi: Yes! All eight. (GRUNTS) (TWIG SNAPS) Jungle Master mode! dal shi: Come on! What are you doing so far out in the woods, Red Ranger? You must be lost. RED RANGER: Far from it. I know you have the Crystal Eyes, and you're not leaving here with them. The Phantom Beasts are not coming back! Never say never. Take this! (SCREAMING) (RHINO RANGER GROANING) YELLOW RANGER: Charge! Together! (RANGERS GRUNTING) (RANGERS GROANING) dal shi: The Phantom Beasts will return! Not without a fight, Jarrod! dal shi: And a fight is exactly what you're going to get. (LAUGHING) (JELLICA SCREAMING) dal shi: Jellica! RED RANGER: No! Your friends have been destroyed. My friends can defeat your Rin Shi. dal shi: Rin Shi, yes. But they are battling Grizzaka. They haven't a chance against him. Grizzaka? Zokado! (RED RANGER SCREAMS) They're mine! (LAUGHS) RED RANGER: Firing Jets! This isn't over yet! (GROWLING) Zokado! (RANGERS GROANING) We've got to think of a different strategy! JELLICA: Poor little Rangers. While Dai Shi destroys one, Grizzaka destroys the others. Charming. (SCREAMING) YELLOW RANGER: We need Casey! Even if he was here... This guy's too much. And he's not done yet. (GROWLS) (RANGERS SCREAMING) You've destroyed all of my warriors, my Royal Guards and the great Overlord Carnisoar. Finally, I shall destroy you! BLUE RANGER: Casey! RED RANGER: You're about to get a dose of your own medicine. Claw Booster! (SCREAMS) JELLICA: What? (RANGERS GASPING) Dom, let me have your Morpher! Really? Okay! Tiger and Rhino combine! Hey! How did you know that would work? RED RANGER: I didn't know until now. GRIZZAKA: It won't work! (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRIZZAKA GROANING) (JELLICA GRUNTS) Finish this, Grizzaka! RED RANGER: Firing Jets! (GRIZZAKA GROANING) RHINO RANGER: All right! YELLOW RANGER: Casey, how did you do that? Well, I figured Grizzaka's too powerful for any of us alone. But now, we have Dominic's Rhino power. RHINO RANGER: Yeah. Casey's right. That's what made the difference. RHINO RANGER: It's all about the Rhino. But I'll need my Morpher back. RED RANGER: You've got it! RHINO RANGER: Hey, Case, I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself with this thing. RED RANGER: (CHUCKLING) Yeah, right. You ready to do this? -Yeah! -RANGERS: Yeah! You'd better be ready! (GRUNTS) RANGERS: Firing Jets! RANGERS: Claw Cannon! Wolf Beam! Rhino Blade! (GRIZZAKA GRUNTS) RANGERS: Fire! (GRIZZAKA GROANING) -Yeah! -RHINO RANGER: We did it! RED RANGER: Hold on! We have seen this before. GRIZZAKA: That was nothing! I won't let it happen again! I'm the strongest fighter there will ever be! (GROWLING) (RANGERS GRUNTING) RANGERS: Jungle spirits, go! Gorilla spirit! Penguin spirit! Antelope spirit! RANGERS: Jungle Master Megazord! Spirit of the Wolf! Combined! Wolf Pride Megazord! Defeat them, Grizzaka. If you lose, Dai Shi will destroy me! (GRIZZAKA GRUNTING) (RANGERS GRUNTING) FLIT: Could this be the greatest match-up of all time? Yikes! Three's a crowd! I'm out of here! I lost the Crystal Eyes. Zokado! (RANGERS GROANING) Rhino power! Rhinozord Warrior mode! Weak! (GRUNTING) (GRIZZAKA GROANING) GRIZZAKA: It is your turn to learn the same lesson all of my enemies have. There is no one as powerful as Grizzaka, and never will be! Guys, you ready to end this? Let's do it! RED RANGER: Right with you, Dom! All at once! Come on! (ALL GRUNTING) (GRIZZAKA SCREAMS) Animal spirits! (HOWLS) RANGERS: Stampede! (GROWLS) RANGERS: Jungle Master Spin Attack! the hell is going on with the world? Everything's crazy. Now I risk my Iife just coming into work. Makes you miss the mob days. Back then, this never would have happened. And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead, every last one of them. And you would never know about it. Mr Duncan, take a deep breath and tell us what happened. We'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages. Then "bang" the chandelier comes crashing down It sounded like an explosion, so I dropped to my knees, took cover. Anything else? Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop. OK. Thanks a Iot. And check in with Triage before you leave. - Well, that was helpful. - Actually, it was. it gives us a starting point The falling chandelier distracts the guards and makes them easy targets The armed robbers load up, head for the exits. A quick escape. Chaos moving in one direction, the money moving in the other. Can you imagine living out here? It's peaceful. Peaceful? The town just lost 5% of its population. - I thought you said this was a single homicide. - Yeah. In a population of 20. Made it. State trooper. SARA: Woo Two hours to drive 75 miles? You guys got lost. What's the rush? The crime scene's not going anywhere. Yeah, but I am. The body's behind the counter. Dustin Bale Store clerk. Bullet through the chest. The register's empty. Officer... Spencer, did you touch anything? 14 years as a state trooper. I can secure a crime scene without contaminating the evidence. Sorry. It's OK. Look, I cover 97.5 square miles. I gotta book. Vomit? Not an expectorant. Potato. Blown to smithereens. The poor man's silencer. Now... why would an assailant need a silencer way out here? The last paying customer? Eight hours ago. We just got the call. This place is open 24/7. Why'd it take so long? SARA: The assailant flipped the sign on the way out, buying him time to get away. But not without getting his picture taken first. It's plastic. You're joking? A nine volt attached to a blinking light. Well...real or fake, it didn't work. There was three of 'em. They come from round the corner, guns drawn. I think they came from over there. There were two of them. OLDER WOMAN: I said four There were four of those lunatics. They were everywhere. - Write it down. - Right, I got it. Thank you. Excuse me. You know, I've interviewed 17 people. No two accounts are alike. A professor got students to watch a basketball game, count the times the ball was passed. - Yeah? Ground-breaking. - During the game, a person in a gorilla suit ran across the court. Afterwards, the professor asked them if they noticed the gorilla. 50% responded, "What gorilla?" That's wonderful. If I see a gorilla, I'II arrest him. The car was sitting right here. Did you get a good look at it? Make? model? No. It was beige. Beat-up. Hazards flashing. People leave their cars here all the time. I wait ten minutes, then call for a tow. - Did the car peel out? - No The driver gunned it. I didn't hear a screech. (Car alarm) It smells like burnt wood. Motor oil? No, transmission fluid. But it's brown, not red. Which means? It's not the right colour. Extraction is an art, Albert. I Iike to think so. So, this is our cross-dresser in the blue coat? ID'd as Adam Brower. Shot in the back with a hollow point. close range. It mushroomed upon impact, maximising trauma. Calibre? .45. Well, the guards were armed with 9mm and they weren't hollow point. So... He was shot in the back by one of his own partners? Someone didn't want to share. Wow. A fumette. - Did you get that out of some museum? - Hey don't knock it Still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard. Blow and print. If you were in a hurry, how would you get back there? Easy. Jump the counter. Exactly what I'm thinking. Shoe prints. Lay it out. The suspect entered. He shoots the clerk through the potato Then hops up and over leaving behind since prints He grabs the cash flips the sigh from "open" to "closed" and exits How old's the killer? What are you thinking? The shoe size is five, six, tops. We may be looking for a minor. You want to see me? Yeah. This is the video surveillance from that heist. This camera was trained on their entrance. AII the disguises in the world and they dress like women. Ski masks are played out. Red and Blue teamed up together and took out the guards in the rolling cage. Black shot down that chandelier. Well, Blue's the decedent, ID'd as Adam Brower, so enlarge Red. Yeah, no amount of make-up in the world can cover up that chunk of Adam's apple. That must be the one that killed Brower. A .45 in the back at close range. No honour among thieves. Photoshop black. No stubble. - No Adam's apple. - Dressed as a woman Among men dressed as women. Now, see? That's a disguise. Fluorescent powders? Yeah. Why not? They're in the kit. The protocol's black. Since when do you care about my choice of powders? The Assistant Coroner is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body, and I haven't even heard from Grissom. You know, I've never tried green. I shouldn't have been sent here. I've got seniority. I deserve... no I've earned the right to pick my cases If I start eating, I will shut up. Do you have a mirror? Since when do you care about your appearance? I mean, at a crime scene. It's not for me. Sorry. We can't touch it. I'm just getting a better look. - Oh, thank God. It's about time. - Nice to see you, too. Well, I smell the body. Where is he? Hey, David. I... I wasn't touching him. I know you better than that. - What took you so long? - Made a wrong turn at the fork. - You're a surfer now? - Oh, dude, I rip. We're 300 miles from the nearest beach. Surfing is just a state of mind. I got your page. - Where's my report? - Relax. The GC mass spec's working on it. Should be done er... (Machine beeps) - how Transmission fluid. Yeah. Thanks. Type F with Dexron. - So? - So... You should be reading Car And Driver instead of Sand Surf. Someone put the wrong type of fluid in the car's transmission. You see, Ford automobiles use a thick red type F transmission fluid. general Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with Dexron. When Dexron's put into a Ford, it thins that type F fluid. Friction builds, gears grind. The second gear is the first to go Friction causes the engine to overheat in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown. The leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem. Well, congratulations. You're looking for a Ford with a leak. Not just a Ford. The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear. Which means it can't get very far. My guess is it's already been dumped. BRASS: Before Mr Brower dressed up as a woman and heisted a casino, he was a janitor at an office park off Flamingo. Before that, he was out of town. Pour years, grand larceny. Well, the manager's not in. I got a warrant. I got a key. Woo. A tidy little camper, isn't he? WARRICK: yeah - What are we looking for? - Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators. Dirty laundry? I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist. Let's take it all back to the lab. OK. Let's see. Well, while you're at it, don't forget his wigs and bras. CATHERINE: Anything on the shoe print? Skechers. Adult size five. SARA: Female - Well, at least we're not chasing a kid. How's the prints coming? You two lifted 82 suspect prints. 43 are partial. We id'd one from the "open closed" sign. - Great. - Well, not so great. The state trooper. You gotta be kidding me. Officer Moron contaminated the scene? Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain. Tough. I Iike that. TECHNICIAN: Match - Print off the register - What have you got? - Tammy Pelton. - Who's Tammy Pelton? A fugitive...and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars She tried to play me, but I didn't bite. Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them. - Biological parents? - Tammy was kidnapped as a child and raised by her kidnapper. When she found out the truth, she killed him. Hey, finish running the prints. Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone. CATHERINE: Grissom! If you're gonna badger me about your crime scene location, put it in a memo. You don't read memos. - Do you remember Tammy Pelton? - I always remember the ones that get away. She's back. And she's been to CalNevAri. She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide. Grissom. I need you. ASAP. Please. GREG: So, Ballistics sent me a bullet from the casino. It's a .45, so we know it came from one of the ladies' guns. - And this is a special bullet? - No. But there was a foreign substance adhered to it. The substance is special? - Er, not exactly. - Just get to the point, Greg. To-may-to. To-mar-to. - Ro-tay-to... - Wait a second. There was potato on the bullet? you bet - Strange, huh? - There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun. - This bullet is from my investigation. - Right. One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist. Tammy Pelton? Maybe. Three armed robbers. Adam Brower killed at the scene Tammy Pelton, and we're still one suspect short. SARA: Another match from the convenience store. The print on the outside doorknob belongs to ex-con Darin Hanson. You know this guy too? catherine: He ran with Tammy's "father" Mostly from the law. So, Tammy kills "Dad" and she and Darin Hanson run off together. A regular Bonnie and Clyde. Just what Vegas needs. GRISSOM: Let me see, Bobby. The projectile on the left, a .45 hollow point, courtesy of Adam Brower's back. On the right, a 45 hollow point extracted from Dustin Bale the dead clerk at the convenience store The bullets confirm the story told by the potato. - The same gun. Two crimes. One case. GRISSOM: Three suspects Adam Brower, deceased. Tammy Pelton, Darin Hanson, still at large. Hey, guys. I just got a call from Brass. We got a possible getaway vehicle off I-93. - What makes you think it's the right car? - it's beige abandoned a '77 Mercury Cougar Mercury's a division of Ford. I'II drive. A trucker called it in. Well, if that's the getaway car, there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby. Yeah. Check for treads, Jim? Yeah. - Shall we? - Let's go. If you were stashing a car, where would you hide it? Well, these bushes would provide good cover. NICK: Oh. Check out that dirt displacement. Yeah. BRASS: Skid mark One tyre Where's the other one? There isn't one. Dirt to pavement. Then the trail goes cold. No damage. This car was barely moving. It was dumped. detail. CATHERINE: Pop the trunk Thanks. It's Tammy. Contusions on the anterior neck. Streaking erythema on the lateral aspect of zone one Cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed. Hey, doc. Catherine. She didn't put up a fight, did she? How'd you know? She was killed by the one person in life she trusted. Ahh! Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming. He put his thumbs around her air pipe and pushed. I swabbed her neck. Affirmative for epithelials. I'II run them against Darin Hanson's DNA. The parents called. They're on their way in to lD. How did they sound? Oddly...relieved. They finally know where she is. I'm not pulling it. I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes. Check it out. real live fairy dust. Yeah. Turns grown men into criminals. What's the composition? Si- O2. Silica dust. Each particle's 100 times smaller than a grain of sand. I thought you guys were processing the car. Yeah. Um, what do you know about silica? It's used to make glass. It's mined in open pits. Why? NICK: silica found both on Adam Brower's clothing and the getaway vehicle. There's an abandoned silica mine outside CalNevAri. What don't you know? (Sirens) Come here. The motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site Eurgh. That smells nice. It shouldn't smell at all if this place is abandoned. Get your guns out. (Sighs) Say hello to Darin Hanson. Shot with a .45. Execution style. NICK: Adam Tammy And now Darin. AII dead. And we're out of suspects. Three robbers hold up the casino Tammy was in black Adam was the one in blue And that leaves us Darin. We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store. Hours before the heist, the clerk gets murdered. Shot with the same gun used to kill Adam at the casino. The surveillance video tells us that Darin was the only one in position to shoot Adam. Why did Darin kill Adam? SARA: Greed Fewer slices. Bigger pieces. Which explains why he killed Tammy. - That's confirmed? - Epithelials on her neck match Darin's DNA. - Darin thought he was getting the whole score. SARA: But how he's dead So, who killed him and where's the money? And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy took out a convenience store clerk. Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a few hundred thousand? We've got more questions than answers. I just got off the phone with the LaughIin CSI assigned to last month's Cottage Casino case. He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three. Maybe Tower Club surveillance missed something. Actually, it didn't. We did. Tower Casino surveillance. On your left, the camera's trained on where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered. The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables. OK. Check it out. - What are we looking for? - What? You missed him? I'II play it again, slower, just for you. WARRICK: Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier. - He ducked before the chandelier fell. - Before Tammy drew her gun. Play it again. GRISSOM: Well done Warrick You've found our mole. The pit boss's name is Max Duncan. He started working there about three weeks ago, and before that... Let me guess. Laughlin? Cottage Casino? I'II call Brass. He can make the arrest. I'II meet him at the station. I'II call you with an update. BRASS: Max Duncan? Yeah. What the hell's going on here? You going somewhere? - Why? BRASS: I'll tell you how this works I ask the questions. You give the answers. Downtown. I'm calling my lawyer. Good idea. Max... are you clairvoyant? Excuse me? The surveillance tape at the Tower Club Casino You ducked before there was a reason to cover. I saw a gun. I hit the ground. BRASS: OK. Let's try this. Why were you leaving town? - Trying to beat a murder rap? - I didn't kill anyone. You forget about Darin Hanson? your car was covered with grey dust. Silica. It places you at the murder scene. - Well, I didn't kill him. I went there, but... LAWYER: Max - I'm advising you not to say another word. - No, I want to clear this up. Right, I went out to the mine, but I didn't kill Darin. He was already dead. AII right. Look, I... I'II admit... I helped him out. I... I told him when and where to hit. That's why I ducked. But that's it. That's a Iot. And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin. - Max, that is enough. - Well, I went to collect my share. But the money was gone, Darin was dead and I panicked. But I didn't shoot him. You can't get me for murder on this. When someone is killed during a commission of a felony, all the conspirators are liable. Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower, but you might as well have pulled the trigger. Let's make a deal. Tell me. Who else was involved? Who killed Darin? Look, Darin was the only one that I spoke to. I never even met the other three. Then we got no deal. BRASS: Officer OFFICER: Let's go. You know what? I kinda believe him. Yeah, me too. He confirmed a fourth. Darin plus three. - Just like LaughIin. - So, the Iast man standing killed Darin. And he's still out there, flushed with cash and a .45 calibre. Surveillance stills from the Laughlin heist Four perps. We've identified three. Darin, Tammy and Adam. - AII deceased. - Yeah. AII murdered. TECHNICIAN: And that leaves one ID the unknown, good chance we solve both cases, laughlin and Vegas. Except all we got is a guy in drag. Well, that's why I'm here. (Technician types) I've divided the photo into segments, removed the disguise and rebuilt the original image based on male physiological norms. Now it's not exact but you'II have an idea what your guy looks like. That's Dustin Bale. - The clerk from the convenience store? - Whoa, hold on. He was killed hours before the Tower Club heist. In on LaughIin. Out on Vegas. So Darin took him cut first He cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery. But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three. Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist. Maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there. He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding under a blackjack table. And we're back to "Who killed Darin Hanson?" - Bobby D. - yeah? I need your help. Another round from the casino heist? indirectly, yeah. Well, the tip didn't blossom. Not a hollow point, so it's not from Darin Hanson's gun. No, it's from his head. BOBBY D: All right 230 grains gives us a .45 automatic. What else? OK. Normally, lands and grooves are highly delineated. These are smooth polished which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel. Be right back. OK. These are the only types of .45 automatics with polygonal barrels. The gun that fired your bullet was either a Heckler Koch USR or a Glock. CATHERINE: Narrow it further Well, that's what I'm doing. Dissecting your bullet. BOBBY D: Hey Nick - Mm-hm? Count the stripes. One, two, three, four, five six - Six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist. - Mm-hm. A Glock's got eight, Heckler Koch, six. You got your gun. Let's run ATF. A pretty unique weapon. Expensive. Not exactly what you'd buy out of the back of a van. (Computer beeps) Only take a second. (Beeping) - See? Can I call it? Only 18 registered in-state. Ten in Clark County. Seven of them still in circulation. - Any names jumping off the page? - Just one It's out of left field. About 75 miles out. You're accusing me of murder? And absconding with a quarter of a mil of stolen money. Where'd you stash the cash? - I'm a state trooper. - How does a cop hook up with an ex-con like Darin? I can answer that. It's all in a day's work. A potato silencer muffles a bullet, but won't silence it. You went in, your gun drawn. Take it easy, pal. You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet? Tammy made you an offer. Drop the weapon. Hey, uh... Let's be smart about this. You can take us in or we can cut you in. They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee. This isn't gonna do it. It'II hold you over...till tomorrow. deal? What are you doing? CATHERINE: you patrol 97.5 square miles Is the CaINevAri mine part of your jurisdiction? - No, I'm east of the mine. - But you've been there, haven't you? Where's the cash? Jim, hit the overhead, will you? GRISSOM: Silica is a crystal it reflects the light Even trace amounts will show up How about that? More than I'd make in a lifetime. Was it worth it? You wouldn't understand. CATHERINE: That's right - We make the big bucks. - Look I was never that guy. You know, that guy that wins the jackpots, gets promoted catches the breaks? It was right there. You're still not that guy. Get him out of here. $250,000 turned a career cop bad. Yeah, well, he had his price. We all do. CZECH TELEVISION and present AUTUMN SPRING Very shabby. This way, Maestro. - Where do we start? - Upstairs, sir. - But it's leaking there. - I'll explain. This way, please. Good morning. Mr. Mayer, the property manager. Maestro Hana, emeritus member of the Metropolitan Opera. His secretary, Mr. Eduard. We hope you're going to like it here, Maestro! - What is this? - The dining room. Only the table remains of the set. Chippendale. Well. We shall see. The property includes and a hunting lodge. There's time to see it, sir, then we'll have brunch at the French Restaurant. Eduard... you say sixty million? - Sixty-five, sir. Let's take a look at the hunting lodge. We're making good time. Excuse me, when can we expect your answer, Maestro? I'm off to the States tomorrow to consult with my lawyer. Should the Countess drop the price call me immediately. You'll have your answer within two weeks anyway. Edited by Music by Director of Photography Story and Screenplay by Executive Producer Directed by Shall we go and have a drink? Iforgot. lhave to go home. You were great today, Fanda. Magnificent! Next time we'll reverse roles. No way! It's in your blood. The way you tasted and sent back the wine! That was a masterpiece of acting, Fanda! Igot carried away. Inearly believed it myself! - Old men should be rich. - And respected. I'm off. We haven't gatecrashed our way into a wedding for ages! mine! Gimme that! - Quietly, girls! - Sit down. - I'll have to go, Mom. - No, wait a bit longer. - I's been two hours. Imust get back to work. He promised to come. Something held him up. at the drunk tank. He celebrated with friends from the theater... He treated the whole pub, spent his whole pension and you couldn't pay the rent. - Be quiet! - Don't shout at them. It's not the money, Mom. I'll gladly help out. Iworry about Dad. his actions just aren't normal, at his age! His age has him down. He's afraid to die, and tries to cheat it. Is Grandpa going to die? We're all going to die. Some sooner, some later. Grandpa sooner, right, Dad? Wipe your mouth and be quiet! Mother... have you talked it over? lhaven't found the right opportunity. I'm really worried. Yesterday's scene... - Mom hit Auntie with a ladle. - On the head! And our Mom broke all the plates. Girls, Grandpa will love the pictures you drew for him, but we must go. Grandpa looked forward so much to seeing you. His memory isn't what it used to be. Let's go. Hurry up... your jackets. Stick it out a bit longer, Jara. I'll talk to him. Good evening. Hello, I took your elevator, didn't I? No. I suffer from claustrophobia Hello! Are you trying to kill me? You silly ass! Don't say a word, get out of my sight! Or I'll pack up your things and send you off to Ed's! Five people waiting for you for three hours to wish you a happy birthday and you go off on a binge! Can a couple of measly flowers set that straight? No, I know they can't. So why spend money on them if you know that? - Because you love gerberas. - No, I don't. - You do. - I don't. - Yes, you do. - I don't! So there! All right, so you don't. Here are your presents from the girls and me. That's a pretty picture. Karolina is she by Jara's first or second wife? Pull yourself together, you're nearly eighty, afamily man with two daughters-in-law and four lovely grandchildren, stop playing the fool and start taking life seriously. Sorry... but this is quite witty! This could be your lastbirthday, and we didn't celebrate it. I'd be really sorry. Believe me. Ido believe you. What's this? - Black shoes. - For my burial? Hardly for dancing lessons! Though one never knows with you. Here's your cake. It cost 150 crowns and the shoes 1200 Did you say anything? I thought the shoes were from Jara. No, he had a present for both of us. It happens to be my birthday too, you know. I bet it's something original. It's a gift worth 28 000 crowns. Not an Arctic seaside holiday, Oh come on! Look, what a beautiful death announcement! One loving heart from this world has been taken. Not even our love can this heart reawaken. I must write that down. Give me a pencil. I'll wait here for you and memorize it. No, come with me. Well? How d'you like this grave? What do the Va ouses have to do with us? Nothing. The family died out, and Jara bought the grave for us. So that's the gift for 28 000 crowns? It's a bargain at that price. Jara has a friend who's an undertaker. Are you going to lie in there with the Va ouses? - We'll both be there, Fanda. - Not me. If Jara's used to buying second-hand graves that's his business. I refuse to lie there with some Va ous woman. You won't know where we've put you. But I know now! And I don't like it here. Such a measly little cemetery, all swarming with graves, and no view at all. I can't even enjoy my smoke here. Fanda! Come back! Death will still catch up with you! Hey... I don't believe it! What are you doing here? Sorry, I really can't quite place you... - Come on, try! - Josef Novak? No! Forgotten your best friend? My best friend... Venda Bayer? Yes, Venda Bayer! What a memory! I'm sorry I didn't recognize you... But I thought you were taller than me. Yes, but I had an accident. Coming down Mont Everest I fell 60 yards both my legs were fractured in three places, Professor Cech had to shorten my bones by 55 inches. I never heard. But I went on, Mont Blanc and all, and you? - How's the love of your life? - You mean Milena? Yes, what a beauty! How we all envied you. I'll tell you. I married her. Fifty years ago. A month ago I buried her. I'm so sorry. She was a cutie. And how are you doing? Badly, on the way back from the crematorium I crashed my car. It wasn't insured so it cost me 355 000! The funeral cost 255 000. Now I can't even buy her a decent wreath. Here's 200. Get her some flowers, give her my best and say Venda Bayer thinks of her often. I'll tell her, Venda, thank you. Hey, what's this? No tears! Look to the summit! As we mountaineers say, where there's a will there's a way. So keep that chin up! Karel! Come here! - I wanted it 7 inches and it's 8! - I'll redo it. - And pronto! - Boss, a call for you! - I'm busy. - It's Erna. What is it now, dammit? - Call Janousek. - What should I tell him? To come at nine. Okay, I'm going. Out of my bathroom! Get the fuck out or I'll throw all your things out! For God's sake... Erna, don't do it! - Shit! Stop it, Erna! - There, you pig! Don't! Stop it! For fuck's sake! Erna! Stop it, girls! Damn you Erna, stop it. - Jara, it was so awful! - Stop it, Erna! - Jara! - All right, all right. Quiet, kids. It'll be all right. Ticket control. - Oh, could you overlook it? - We forgot. We're from out of town, mister ticket. It'll be a 200 crown fine each, young ladies. Can't you just forget it? - Sorry, rules are rules. - Let them go, boss. They'll give us a nice kiss each. Quickly, then. So nobody sees us. Funeral... Where's the drugstore? That goes in here... I lent you 500. You promised it back today. Come on! That was funeral money. Stop playing the fool with your French. You won't learn it now that you're eighty. I'm 76, if you're interested. No. I'm interested in where that 500 is. - 200 for People in Need. - And the 300? Lunch at a French restaurant where I chose everything from the French menu. Eating up our funeral money when the 30 000 we have isn't enough for two funerals? ! You'll just kick the bucket without a worry and I'll have to save up before I can die. - All right, so I'll wait. - That'd be a fiasco. You'd spend the money and toss me in some field. So do you want me to die first or you? Tell me! I don't care. But you should care. What if you had a stroke? - What would I do with you? - Put me in hospital. After a while they'd stick you into a rest home, where they'd stuff you into a cage. But don't worry. I have a solution. Listen. We'll go to a senior citizen's home. But we must go now. They only take fit people. But if you get a stroke there, they look after you. You're going to like it there, Fanda. I told the manager you sang in operetta. She'll give you a room with a view into the woods, a lovely room. We'll take our furniture. Jara will pay for the move. - Oh. Jara. - He arranged it all. He wants us in a home so he can have this place. You know how they're living. Erna wants Kveta out. Where will she take the girls? Here, like last time. After Jara's first divorce we left him and Kveta our lovely big apartment in town and moved out to this rabbit-warren here. Now he's with his 3rd wife. The 2nd wife's in the way so he found us a lovely room with a view into despair. - Tell Jara... - Wait, let me explain. Tell Jara... Even if he gets married and divorced ten more times I'm staying here. Nobody gets me out of here alive! - Do you want to go in? - Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Maestro. Good morning. Are you about to purchase another mansion? Hello, boys. I am staying with my brother at the moment. Come in. - Do come in. - Thank you. Didn't you like it at the Hilton? Yes, but my brother insisted I stay here. We haven't seen each other for three years. - Oh really? - Do take a seat. I've added it all up, Mr. Hana. Here it is... The hired limo, the brunch, add in wasted time, plus 50 percent for the intent to mislead me into turning other clients down. The total comes to a 29 100 crowns. Right? Would you like it in cash or onto your account? In cash. Within a week. How about some coffee, tea or maybe a cognac... Where does my brother keep the cognac? No thanks. You surprise me. I thought I'd have to take you to court. An emeritus member of the Metropolitan Opera knows the value of success and failure. You were good, Mr. Hana. Convincing. If you hadn't mixed up your visiting cards, I'd have believed you'd buy the mansion. Maybe next time. I've called everybody I know. No one will lend me anything. Things used to be different. The times have changed, but we haven't. Here's 10 000. I'll give you 3 more on the 155th. Too late, I must pay up by Saturday. Let's try the casino. - Let's break the bank! - I don't know... - I'm not going in, Fanda. - What are you scared of? Haven't we played aristocrats and rich men? - In Die Fledermans. - Only in the chorus. So now you're a soloist, button up and come on in! We'll show the nouveau riche lumpenbourgeoisie. Don't go in! I'll get you the 20 000 somehow. Stop it. Good afternoon. Where do we start? Here or here? You used the service entrance instead of going through the reception desk! - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - We're from television. We want to shoot 3 scenes for a co-production film. He's clean. We need to settle the conditions. Speak to our marketing manager. Maybe we'll come for a game some day too. It was a pleasure, gentlemen! What a show-down! The shame of it! You were no help at all. I'm sorry. I'll get you the money. Good afternoon. - Let me help you with that. - I can manage. - It would be my pleasure. - All right then. Thank you, it's kind of you. - Been traveling again? - I've been to Ostrava with my husband. They played against Banik. So your husband is a soccer player? Yes, for the Sparta club. And you go with him? I have to. He's terribly jealous. That's understandable. - I'll take them up for you. - That'd be nice of you. It's the fifth floor, the door on the left. - How about coming along? - No. Thank you. - Thank you very much, Mr... - Hana. I can't use you like this, Mr. Hana. You may. Anything. Madame. Thank you, I'll be seeing you. - Is that her? - Yeah. Will she lend us some money? Buy a big bouquet to set the mood. Then leave it to me. Good morning. - Hello, uncle Ed! - I've brought a customer. He needs a special bunch of flowers. For you, Uncle, they'll be very special. Hello. What kind? What sort of price? Up to about 1000 crowns. For what occasion? Who are they for? For the French ambassador's wife. In that case lilies would be splendid. - How's Venda doing? - As usual. Her husband is an alcoholic. Or orchids? Or roses? I've got lots. I'll leave it up to you, Marcela. How long is it since your Mom... Just yesterday I wanted to buy flowers for her grave. That's nice of you. And someone stole my wallet! With my month's pension in it! I went all hot and cold. - I burst into tears. - Tell her why! Why? All my money for the month... Tell her, don't be shy. Yes... all of it... He'll lose the chance for a wonderful role. What role? He's been chosen for a film about a concentration camp. To play an old mime who saves 80 Jewish children. Seriously? If he learns tap-dancing within two months. That's easy. You'll be in a movie, uncle Ed? - Wonderful! - But he wants to refuse since the American dance teacher wants 50 dollars a lesson. Fifty dollars? That much? And how many lessons. .... Ten. That's 20 000 Czech crowns, but he gets 10 000 dollars for the part! Ten thousand? That's nearly half a million! Half a million? I'm sorry, uncle Ed. I can't lend you the money. Venda's drinking, the tax man, school fees. 950 crowns! - Pay up! - You have the money. Here you go. - Keep the change. - Bye, and thank you! What do I do with the flowers? Put them on your sister's grave. I heard that Mary Grulich had her 855th birthday. - How about... - So let's catch a taxi! - 'Bye for now, and take care. - Good morning. I just brought Mary her shopping. She's in a bad way, her legs, poor thing, that tiny pension and she forgets everything. She owes me 2000 but I'm not saying anything. She'll be pleased to see you, gentlemen. - No way! - Oh yes! We come with our congratulations on behalf of the theatre. They all send their regards. They remembered! You were the pride of the theatre for 40 years! The oldest chorus-girl in history. And a soloist, boys, but you wouldn't remember. In '41 I sang Helena in Polish Blood as stand-in. The lead tenor gave me these flowers afterwards and this bottle of old Spanish wine. How we loved Polish Blood! We all wanted to sing Count Baransky. I know since you're a cavalier... I am not right for you, dear... I'm just a maid, after all... It's over and done with now. You've made me so happy, boys. I slept right through my horrible birthday. But now we'll celebrate! I saved it for 60 years for the right occasion. Open it! Vintage 1930! - Here's a cork-screw. - What an honor for us. You were always the princess of our dreams. This wine's so good it doesn't want to come out! How much is there left? The flowers, taxi... 6000 of your money. I left 2000 under Mary's vase. You are so kind, Fanda. Good deeds pave the way to heaven. But is there an afterlife? Who knows. Just in case... so be good. Give that boy a hundred. - A whole hundred bill? - For both of us. - Isn't that too much? - You don't want to get to heaven? - Here you go. - Right on. Thank you very much. Stop! Stop thief! - I feel like crying, Fanda. - That won't help. - Good, he didn't take my ID card. - What will you do? I'll have to tap into the funeral savings. How about selling something? The anatomists buy skeletons. But they don't take baldies. Seriously, what will you do? We're down to our last thousand. So let's let off some steam. Come on, do something! Can't you see that I can't see? Bring me the funeral savings book. I'm going to the bank. - Where is it? - In the big dish. It's not in the dish. But I put it there. Here it is. My, you scared me. I think you'd better... not open it. - Fanda! - I took out thirty thousand. Thirty thousand? ! D'you want to borrow my glasses? I'm not going to scream. I'm going to kill you. Well, I understand how you feel... - So you understand? - Absolutely. So why did you take the only money we have? I've been betting on your birth date in the lottery for 30 years. I expect to hit the jackpot now. What have you done with the money? I was sorry that you'd only ever been to Hungary. I wanted to buy you a holiday in Hurghada. - Where? - The Red Sea, Luxor, Karnak, Queen Hatshepsovet's Temple. I'm not going to any Hukarda! You won't, because a bogus blind man stole the money. The Red Sea. A bogus blind man! D'you expect me to believe you? - No. - So why make up these lies? - Why deceive me? - You're shouting. Yes, let everyone hear that my husband's a liar and thief who ruins my health and shortens my life. I can't even die decently because of him! But I've had enough of your silly pranks. Kill it! The moth! - Put that paper back. - I will, after I've read it. He complained someone's stealing his paper! How does he know? It's in place when he comes home. Yes, with the crossword puzzle done. He can't do it himself anyway. Don't smoke. You'll cough. I cough better when I smoke. By the way, I want that 30 000 back. And tie your shoelace. I'll think it over. Till then you'll give me all of your pension. That might make you take life seriously at last. - What did you say? - It's going to be a lovely day! When we've done the shopping we're going to Jara's to look after the children. - Josef! What a coincidence! - Josef who? A scene-shifter from the theater... See you at the yogurt counter. It was parked here! My new car! I saved up for it for five years. I didn't notice it. What color was it? Yellow. Stolen with Agapornis fisheri - What am I going to do? - You must report it. Come, I'll take you to the police station. Those jerks are supposed to watch this parking lot. Let's go! Two luxury villas. And a magnificent mansion for 60 million. - But that's 200 miles away. - It looks splendid. But 155 rooms, that's not really enough. There are servants' quarters with 10 rooms. It would make an exclusive bed and breakfast place! Good idea. Antique furniture, oriental rugs, old paintings and the prettiest waitresses in period costumes. - Or without... - Hey, control yourself. Beauty queens, anyway. 36,24, Make the arrangements so they take us there. I'm due for a medical check-up. If the worst comes to the worst would you look after my dog. He's an old softie. He's bitten me twice! That's a token of love, he bites me too when I go out. He stands on a chair by the window and I wave to him so he knows I'll be back. Old age is sad. One should die young. We missed our chance. We gotta stick it out now. Easy for you to say. I cry when I hear an oompah band. I see those sad, abandoned doggie eyes. I'd shoot myself if it wasn't for you. In that case aim for the heart to be sure. A tip from the court pathologist. It's a trophy from the theatre. What's the problem, anyway? Kidneys, high blood pressure, cataracts. You are lucky! I've got arrhythmia, gall-bladder, prostate - but it's all better than having AIDS. You're such a lucky fellow, Fanda. - Help me, please! - Come on. - No! Don't be scared, it's safe! - Oh God. Do something, sing! - Don't be frightened. Oho, cried Robin Hood... I'll give you Robin Hood! Stop! We'll ride up and down until he cools off. Sing! Stop! Calm down. It's perfectly safe. - What's all this? - Hello Dad. Well you see Kveta... I mean Erna... You see if we do move to that home. Jara has to furnish this room for Kveta. I've been there. It's a very nice place. You could move in within two months. I am not moving out of here. - We have to help them, Fanda. - No, we don't. like my meal now. - Sorry. Enjoy. We just need to make About what? I'm staying here, in my apartment. Jara bought us this place. And he brought me the 30 thousand you were robbed of. Good, because if you hound me out of here, you'll be needing that money, dear. What... Who's driving you out? Where are you going? - I don't feel well. - What's wrong? How could you sell me like this? Mrs. Hanova... Fanda is dead. He's dead. He came here awfully upset, sat down and suddenly collapsed. He didn't regain consciousness. I don't believe it. Why didn't the doctor save him? Why didn't he help him, Mr. Stara? She's arrived by taxi carrying a black suit. By taxi. Now we're screwed. Look, a funeral van. Go on ahead, Mom. Watch your step. I'm sorry. He fainted. He went dead white and stopped breathing. Don't cry, everything will be all right! You said the doctor couldn't help him. I thought I called the ambulance... So was the doctor here or wasn't he? No. Ed wanted to help me. So that you'd realize what you'd lose in him. And he sort of overdid it a bit. The taxi cost 500, the coffin 3000! The fright nearly cost me my life! You put him up to it! You criminal! You liar! You heartless brute! This way... I can't go on. I refuse to live with him. - So what's with the coffin? - Take it away. - That'll cost you. - We'll settle it right now. Hello Dad, hello Ed. Dad! Move in with me, nobody'll bother you and you can do as you like. Emilie Hanova and Frantisek Hana. Applicant, please clarify your petition for a divorce. I made my statement in writing and have nothing to add. How long have you been together? For 44 years. A long time. You went through a lot together. Good things and bad. Is your marriage now so seriously impaired - That it cannot be saved? - Yes. Does the applicant's lawyer have any questions? Did your husband often spend his whole pension without contributing to the household? Do you know what he spent the money on? - Different things. - Give us some examples. I asked him to visit his father's grave and he returned a week later from some spa. He lost his month's pension and 4000 crowns at the Casino. But he didn't go there to gamble, he heard about the sightseeing flights and he always had longed to see the world from a bird's-eye view. But there was fog, he had to wait for good weather and he gambled the money away out of boredom. And he spent your savings in expensive restaurants. He had a poor childhood. During the depression his father split matches in half to save money and as a boy he served beers in a gadren pub. He wanted to see what it's like to be rich. Did you tolerate his behavior? No, but when I was mad he brought me flowers and I always forgave him. - Any more questions? - That will be all. As the respondent, do you have anything to say? It's true, the applicant always forgave me but I didn't appreciate it. You may sit down. For the records... - Well? How's it going? - Badly. Witness Jaroslav Hana. Just as an example. Once mother persuaded him to look after his grandchildren for a while. He took my two little girls to a cafe by taxi. To a smoky cafe... He ordered champagne, they all got tipsy and he forgot them on the subway. But Dad's a very kind man. He's fun and he's generous, but... Incompetent. Being so irresponsible, he's just not fit for marriage. Life with him really is sheer martyrdom. It's very hard for me to have to say this. Mother thought he'd grow wise with age but this last thing was a very cruel trick and mother realized she couldn't stand more. Can you describe this cruel trick? He put his friend up to it... Ed... Mr. Stara told mother that Dad had died at his place. - Do you wish to speak? - Yes. Out with it, Mom. It was a terrible thing to do, devastating. Although I admit I went against him when our son wanted our flat for his ex-wife and kids. and arranged to move us to an old folks' home. He refused, and for my effort to help our son he punished me so cruelly. Me, who always forgave him for all his crazy ideas. Because I admired him for being so different. I'm a stick-in-the-mud sort of person, studying maps. He means to fly round the world in a balloon, and he refuses to admit that our paths don't really lead anywhere anymore. It's intolerable. The older he gets, the crazier he is. He doesn't go to funerals, he makes fun of death, he makes paper darts out of death announcements. I don't know if he wants to be buried or cremated! He doesn't know the price of bread, but follows the dollar exchange rate. When the dollar dropped he bought me 8000 crowns worth for Xmas. He throws money around and saves money - by stealing our neighbor's newspaper. He always returns it in time but I'm on tenterhooks he'll be caught at it. When we took the train to his dad's grave he didn't buy any tickets. The inspector caught us but Fanda proudly paid the fine and left him a tip! The inspector burst into tears. And when I scold him he says I'm right and just goes on doing it. I've been listening carefully. I feel that in your own way you still love your husband despite his shortcomings. Let me ask you again. Are you fully convinced of your incompatibility? Please tell me, with your whole heart and conscience. Do you insist on a divorce? No. Even though I know I'm going to regret it. You heard the applicant's decision. Do you wish to say anything? I want to state that I love my wife and that I'll mend my ways. Thank you. - Nice, isn't it? - Yes. Nice. Jara'll hew off THE VANOUS FAMILY and put up THE HANA FAMILY in gold We'll have our photos taken. I want them on the gravestone. - Isn't it beautiful? - It's very nice here. Don't smoke here, Fanda. It's not fitting... I don't want to harp at you, but... No, that's all right. Done. No, I'd be so glad if you stopped smoking. All right. If you mind that much. It's not because of me. Smoking causes cancer. ... say the health warnings. Exactly. Please bring up some water. The tap's back there by the morgue. Right behind you. Here we'll keep what you save by not smoking. Have you finished all the crosswords again? The storekeeper said they're difficult. Some are, some aren't. Mr. Stara, please leave Fanda alone. No. He does not want to talk to you. Why? What a question! He was nearly divorced because of you! You're going to the hospital? Yes. I'll tell him. Goodbye. That was Ed. He says he's going to the hospital. Which one? He didn't say. Who knows if it's true. He has high blood pressure and his kidney's failing. You should try for a crossword puzzle prize. The storekeeper won a book and 1500 crowns once. - Shall I wash the dishes? - After dinner. Now grind the poppy seeds and take your vitamins. Isn't it wonderful being together like this, - With you helping me. - Yes. Wonderful. Marie from Brod has died! Which Marie? My dad's step-brother's son's wife. I didn't know her. Look how cheap-Iooking the announcement is. - I don't care. - About anything, I know. Luckily it won't be up to you. Here's everything ready for when I die. My death announcement, the undertaker's phone number, my coffin clothes, the addresses where to send the announcements. The funeral music, flowers, even your announcement. So check it to see if you like it. Hello, I'm Mr. Stara's neighbor. - Yes? - Can I speak to Mr. Hana? - Come in. - Thanks. Come on, Bobby! I couldn't find you, pal. Sure... - Got a cigarette? - Don't play the fool. I thought you were paralyzed. Only my right arm and right leg. Not bad here, is it? Fine. That one kicked it. That one's been moved to a loony-bin. He kept walking naked into the nurses' room demanding erotic massages. So how are you doing? I'm training for the wheelchair races. But the damn thing keeps swerving to the left. You'll have to go see the mansion on your own. No, I'll wait for you. Such a beautiful mansion, a really nice place to live. So let's buy it. They might give us a discount. My savings book is in that drawer. Take it. Good idea, we'll borrow the rest. I hope it's enough for my funeral. To hell with that. I'm giving up, Fanda. Should we never meet again, it's been wonderful, it's been just enough. Stop it, stupid. Listen to this, there's a young nurse here who... but you must light up for this story. I don't smoke any more. It's gone too fast. I meant to visit Dad's birthplace. - I'll take you there. - Take me back to bed. Life isn't worth a light and it won't get better. You mustn't give up. Your dog's waiting. God! I can't even take a piss on my own! Hello, Mr. Hana. Will you wait outside for me, Dad? I wanted to say goodbye but you were out. I'm moving to my mother's in Kolin. Cologne? Not that far. Thanks for everything. It's pure hell at home. I don't sleep at all. Don't mention it today. - Hello Dad. - Grandpa! We've got visitors! Which one are you? Karolina? - No, Marketa! - We're going to move here. Be quiet, girls! Sorry, Dad. The two women keep gassing about it in front of them. I'm not angry. I'll have to check out the home for senior citizens. - You don't want to go, do you? - Yes I do. You look like you're going to your execution. the train's here. Listen, I don't want you forced into this. I'd like to see it. If we're moving there. You said you would never move. The situation was different then. Come, let's go home. We missed the train anyway. I've lost a shoe! Here... hold me up... Your coffee. Thanks. You fell asleep again. - No. - Yes! It's getting worse! You snore away all day or sit hunched up by the window like that poor man downstairs. You don't talk, don't smoke, don't drink, don't sing, don't quarrel. I can't stand it any more! - I wanted to please you. - Please me? What happened to you? I married a cheerful man with crazy ideas, with whom I laughed and argued all day and nowadays you sit here like a living corpse, like some dope who doesn't care that I'm unhappy. That I can't live like this! And I won't! Mr. Stara... Forgive me for bothering you, I need your advice. It's about Fanda. He's unhappy. He's terribly unhappy, and I don't know what to do. - Where are you going? - We're are going on a trip. - Where to? - To buy a mansion. Go and get ready. Wait. It's not that simple. It's all arranged. Ed gave me instructions. Who did you say you are? The wife of an emeritus member of the New York Met who is returning to his native country. Is the agent going too? The owner's representative will be at the mansion. What did Ed say? How is he? Poor man, he's going into a geriatric unit. I said we'd come and tell him how it went. I'll get it. I understand. How can you say I'm not supportive? But the situation has changed. You have everything, Jara. Money, a job, your youth - and you have time. We don't have any time. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. No, it's you who complicated things, dear. You shouldn't have gone after all those women. That's all. 'Bye. Hurry up! He's not there! He sat there dead for Come on, then. Look, the trees are blooming! I feel good. Aren't you well? I'm scared to death. Don't worry, you only feel that way the first time. Let's hope I make it through this. - Turn around and drive back. - Yes, sir. Very shabby. I'm not taking it. What? What's happening? Nothing. The place is too small and neglected. I don't think you'd like it here. -So how you been doing, man? -You know, for the most part, I'm fine. " For the most part." Which I'm gonna interpret as meaning though you're not down now, you have something on your mind. So why don't you just tell me what's on your mind? Nothing, really. Which, to tell you the truth, is kind of the problem. I can't figure out what the hell to do with myself. -You're not going back to USC, huh? -No. And that I know is the right decision. But, unfortunately, that's about all I know. Come on. You've gotta cut yourself a little break here. Life did just throw you one hell of a curve ball. All you really need is time. Before you know it, you'll be full of confidence, up to your old tricks. -And you have come to the right place. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're talking to the king of directionless. That's what I was doing with those years of high school folly. I was perfecting the life without purpose. Last year you could've gotten away with that burst of self-deprecation... -...but this year, you seem fairly driven. -Yeah, I know. lt's terrible, isn't it? But what can I say? I love the kitchen life. I even love the crass kitchen attitude. -Sandwich? -Sure. But, inevitably along with the crass kitchen attitude comes the grillside drama. Yeah. lt all started with me trying to help this girl out of her very self-destructive relationship. But then you throw in a little dash of my very poorly thought-out attraction to her and her absolute lack of attraction to me and you get where l'm coming from. Oh, that sucks. Wanna talk about it? No. To tell you the truth, it's really not all that interesting. And it's nothing you should be troubling yourself with given everything that's been on your mind lately. Well for what it's worth, the Pacey I know would figure out a way to help the girl, no matter what the drama. is that so? Without a doubt. Okay. Joey, it's time for a study break. I've been nodding off on the same sentence to the point of drool. -lt's just-- lt's not pretty. -Well, you don't have to ask me twice. Sweet. So where's Jack? Deep in the land of Frat. Did he tell you about this Winter Formal thing? Yeah, that actually sounds vaguely familiar to me. But to be quite honest, all the Greek speak sounds like.... Well, Greek to me. I get it. He wouldn't ask you to the caveman hoopla so I get stuck with the surrogate date duties. I feel for you. I do. Watching Jack pretend to be one with the thick-necked brotherhood. Come on. lt can't be that bad. I'm sure Grams has some prescription medication somewhere that would help you a lot through this, Joey. Thanks, but I think I'll manage. Hey, Jen.... Speaking of the men in our lives how's Dawson these days? You're asking me? Well, it's- - You know I haven't seen him for a while, and I know that you two hang out and I guess I just needed to know that he's doing all right. He's better. He.... He's been seeing a shrink, which I think is really good for him, you know? He's gonna be fine. That's exactly what I needed to hear. It's been.... lt's been kind of hard getting used to not being the one to see him through this, you know? And I think I'm finally okay with it which is hard to admit without feeling like a total jerk. Oh, stop it, Joey. You're not a jerk. I've been meaning to tell you that I can't think of a better person to be there for him right now than you. I'm really treasurer for murdering his mistress. Details. Details. We've got to keep active, Tom. Why? What about waking? Muddy boots. Swimming. Chlorine. Disgusting. How about golf? Oh, you must be joking. (SIGHS) I give up. Good. Hey, Joyce, what about those tennis shorts you used to wear? Have you still got them? Good morning, Captain. Good morning, Captain. Do you know what the time is, Kemp? Do you mind? I'm trying to hole out. Village members should be off the course by midday. I reckon your watch must be fast. It's not even five to yet. Don't worry, Mr Kingslake, this is our last hole. Well, make sure it is. Ruddy yokels cluttering up the course. Oh, come on, Kingslake. They're only here half a day a week. Ooh! I don't like Kemp's manner. He's a trouble maker. He gives us a jolly good discount at that garage of his. I'd rather pay the full whack and not have his ugly mug cluttering up the course. Well, I prefer Kemp to that jumped-up beggar Claypole. God, yes, any day. Go on, then, Drinkwater. Rumour has it that Claypole is angling for full membership. Over my dead body. But not chance of it with you three on the Membership Committee, eh? You know the form, Jerry. Can't discuss membership matters outside the committee room. They're just a pain in the ruddy arse. (SIGHS) Oh, put the thing out of its misery, Drinkwater, for pity's sake. (LAUGHS) Sliced it. Ha! Plugged in Old Glory! Ha ha! Damn! Ali, you really should be quiet when someone's making his stroke. Oh, don't be so wet. A ton says he won't get out of there in one. 200 says I will. OK. How about three? I'll tell you what... let's make it five. For heaven's sake, you two. A demi-grand, it is. Oh, yes. Route one, chaps. A ton says I get up and down in two. Any takers? Not me, Ali. Me neither. You big girls' blouses. Rebecca! Rebecca, come here this minute. And you... you go back to the pro shop now. Yes, sir. What? I pay for you to have lessons with the pro and not with the steward's son. Clyde didn't turn up, so - I don't care. You are not to associate with that boy. Do you understand? Associate (? ) What do you mean, associate? You know very well what I mean. Martin, you have got to do something about Clyde Patchett. Come in, Will. I turn up today and find my daughter being taught by that...ghastly Fountain boy. Actually, Darren isn't a bad little player. He's not even the assistant pro. He's the damned steward's son. And where is Patchett, anyway? He'll be in later. He's got a touch of flu, I think. The kind you catch from a bottle? Now, listen, Martin, you are the captain of this club. Either you do something about Patchett, or I will. Ali, your ball's over here. What's the matter, Kingslake? Don't you trust me? For crying out loud! Mum says you're late. All right, but she'll have to wait till tomorrow. Hey! What the hell's going on? Out in one, Kingslake. You owe me 500. That's impossible. Are you accusing me of cheating? He played it out fair and square, Mr Kingslake. Oh, yeah? And what's it got to do with you? What are you doing on the course at this time of day, anyway? Broken sprinkler on the eighth. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, this is the 12th. So shove off. Course, you'll give me a chance to win my money back. Of course. A grand on Crisp's Folly, then. A grand, it is. Are you all right, old chap? Yeah... Never better. Only a grand, Drinkwater. No pressure. Let the man, play, Ali. Oh, nice one, Jer. Don't count your chickens, Drinkwater. Anything can happen on Crisp's Folly. Ho ho ho! Yes! Route one! Gentlemen, I am on a roll! Well, where the hell's my ball? Like you said, Kingslake, anything can happen on Crisp's Folly. Must have had a bad bounce, Ali. No point looking for it, Ali. Might as well go back to the tee. I hit it straight down the middle! Right. You want some? Right? Do you? Because I'm ready if you are. Kingslake? How the hell did that get there? I hope you're not going to say your ball was on the fairway all the time. For God's sake, Kingslake, what are you doing? (BREATHES SHALLOWLY) Ali? (BUSHES RUSTLE) You idiot. Are you trying to kill me? Sorry. I've got a bone to pick with you. Oh, really? About him. Giving my daughter lessons instead of you. Well, the thing is, I must have picked up a spot of food poisoning. Now what? Something terrible's happened! (PANTS) Some... Someone... S-Someone's... Someone's what, Ed? Someone has killed Ali Kingslake. Multiple heads wounds, Tom. Vicious stuff. Done with that club? Probably. Won't know for sure until we've got him on the slab. Beaten to death with a one iron. What a way to go. This hole was famous, you know. I played it once. I got a quadruple bogey. It's known as Crisp's Folly. Crisp's what? Folly. A chap called Crisp lost his house on a bet playing this hole. It's got a 90-degree dogleg, you see. You take a driver from the tee, you end up in the jungle. With an iron, you may not get a shot at the green. Well, that's absolutely fascinating, George, but I don't speak golf. Where's Jones got to? That's where the momentum... That's where the momentum comes in. Time for golf, have we? Ah...sir. This is Martin Crisp, club captain. And Will Tunstall, president. Dreadful business, Chief Inspector. Rest assured that we at Whiteoaks will do everything we can to assist with the investigation. I think you should know that we've had problems on this hole before. Problems? Vandalism. Loutish behaviour. You see, there's a public footpath goes across the fairway. It's a damned nuisance. What is that? Periscope, sir. So people using the footpath can check if anyone's on the 13th tee. Health and safety is always a priority at Whiteoaks. Mr Crisp, is that the Crisp of Crisp's Folly? Yes, it was my grandfather, the black sheep of the family. As you probably know, John Cotton is a member here, so lines of communication will be first rate. John Cotton? Your Chief Superintendent, Inspector. Yes... Well, thank you, gentlemen, That'll be all for now. We'll talk to you again, of course. Thank you. Thanks. Since when has Johnny Cotton been Chief Superintendent, eh? Last week. You should read your emails. I can't. The computer's broke. What's this? Kingslake's ball, sir. Is it? If Kingslake's ball was here, what was he doing in there? Hacking it out probably. Mind you, he'd need a miracle shot to get to here from in there. So Kingslake disappears into the undergrowth, and one of his mates goes looking for him, yeah? A man called Drinkwater found the body. He says he saw someone fleeing the scene. Any description? No. Just a flash of someone in a blue hoodie. Oh, a hoodie? Ho ho ho. That's perfect, isn't it? Local thug attempts robbery. Respectable citizen resists. Thug beats respectable citizen to death with his own clubs. How convenient is that? Maybe that's what happened, sir. Yeah, well, I'm not holding my breath. Let's go talk to some of these golfers. Well, we were playing the 13th, Crisp's Folly, and Ali creamed it off the tee. Absolutely mullered it. But when we got on the fairway, lo and behold, no sign of Ali's ball. So Mr Kingslake's ball must have gone into the...into the... Rough. ..rough. Well, on Crisp's Folly, you've got jungle either side of you. There's not much point in looking for it. Might as well reload. Reload? Go back to the tee and play a new ball. But Ali charged off into the trees. To look for his ball? Well...yes. Suppose so. And you went to help him... Yes, I... Er... I mean...no. Which exactly? Well, no because his ball was there on the fairway. But you just said there was no sign of it. At first, yes. But then he... Then he obviously found it and played out. So Mr Kingslake's ball reappeared... but he didn't. Yes, that's right, so.. Ahem. I... So you went in to see if he was all right, didn't you? Yes. That's right. I was a little concerned. There had been incidents in the past. Were these incidents reported to the police? I'm really not sure. No idea. So, Mr Drinkwater, you went in to see if Mr Kingslake was all right and...? Yes. There he was. Just lying there. I thought maybe he was ill or something. Then I saw the blood and the ... And then I heard a noise in the wood and saw this...this chap running away. But you can't describe this chap, Mr Drinkwater. Not really. I didn't see his face or anything. He was wearing one of those... hooded things. Bright blue. Ghastly colour. And until you played the 13th, it had been a game much like any other, had it? Nothing untoward, nothing unusual. No. Nothing at all. All perfectly normal. I... Mr Tully? Nothing. Ali did have words with some village members near the 12th tee. Hm. Village members. Residents are allowed to play mornings on Wednesday mornings. Thank you. Words? What kind of words? It was nearly midday. Ali thought it was time they were off the course. Would you mind if we rang for a refill, Inspector? No, please. (RINGS BELL) (KNOCK ON DOOR) Large ones, please, Mrs Fountain. Right away, Mr Monkberry. He was a lovely man, was Mr Kingslake. A lovely man. I'm sure he was, Mrs... Fountain. Eileen Fountain. Mrs Fountain's the steward here. I've been working here 30 years. We've never had anything like this. All right, Mrs Fountain. That'll do. We're gonna have to talk to these village members. Mr Kemp and Mr Claypole. You won't be able to talk to them here, Inspector. No. Village members are not allowed in the club house, sir. You'll find them in the cooler. The cooler? The shed behind the car park, sir, for the use of village members. There's something that lot aren't telling us. I agree, sir. Get Forensics to check their golf clubs, all of 'em. Yes, sir. Look, Jones. There seems to be an assault taking place. They're brothers, believe it or not. Are they? Mrs Fountain's boys, the steward we met. One's the green keeper, the other works in the pro shop. Want to interview them now? No. I'll save that pleasure for later. Where's this cooler? It's round there. Alistair Kingslake did a lot for this club. He'll be sorely missed. Not by me he won't. Steady on, Archie. Inspector Barnaby wants the truth, not the spin. Indeed, I do. Well, the truth is, he was the rudest man I ever met. When you met him on the course, gentlemen, what happened? We was on the 16th green, next to the 12th tee, It was coming up to midday. Kingslake reckoned we should be off the course. He's forever trying to chuck us off. Was. He's a stickler for the rules, that's all. Quite right, too. That's what golf's all about. Sticking to the rules. Where were you this afternoon? Giving Becky Tunstall a lesson. What kind of lesson? Good question, that. Careful, Kemp. Or what? You'll set your big brother on me? Steady on, lads. What will Inspector Barnaby think? What kind of lesson? Golf, of course. So you're a professional. (LAUGHS) He works the pro shop three days a week. And I do some coaching. Only when Clyde Patchett's under the weather, which is most days. Did you play Crisp's Folly this morning? Yeah. About half-ten. There have been incidents, have there not, at Crisp's Folly in the past? Incidents? Yeah. Confrontations with the local hooligans, that sort of thing. Only incidents on Crisp's Folly are golfing incidents. It's a beast of a hole. Ever get the feeling you're not wanted? You're imagining things. (TOOTS HORN) (TOOTS HORN) We need to talk. Follow me. 500 quid. And you didn't hear it from me, all right? So Alistair Kingslake bet Jerry Drinkwater that he couldn't get out of this bunker with one stroke? That's right, and... And? And what, Mr Tully? Well, Jerry jumped into the bunker and the next thing we knew... his ball was out of the sand and right on the green. It was a pretty miraculous shot, to be quite honest. Ali certainly thought so. They... There was brief discussion, shall we say? Did Mr Kingslake accuse him of cheating? Well, it came pretty close, I can tell you. Then Colin Fountain popped up and said he saw Jerry play out fair and square. So that was that. The green keeper? Yes, he was lurking about. Anyway, the whole thing seemed to upset Jerry no end. Then he bet Ali ã1,000 on Crisp's Folly. What? ã1,000? Look, a certain amount of gambling goes on at Whiteoaks. Always has done. No doubt Ali Kingslake can afford to lose a grand here and there, but I can't. And Jerry Drinkwater - can he afford it? I really couldn't say. So, Mr Tully... ..we have Kingslake and Drinkwater playing Crisp's Folly for ã1,000. Kingslake clouts his ball into the wood. He goes in after it and suddenly out it pops. So it would seem. Another miraculous shot. I suppose so, yes. Mr Tully, do you think that Kingslake cheated? Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you can't do either - Do what is fair. Exactly. That's the spirit of golf. And very much the spirit of Whiteoaks, I'd like to think. Mr Tully? You haven't answered my question. If you really want to know a man, Inspector, play golf with him. Ali had a temper, it's true, and his social skills may have been lacking, particularly when dealing with people he regarded as his, how shall I put it - social inferiors - but he was a man of complete integrity. So there. Right, what have we got? An argument over a bet. Yeah. Drinkwater cheats his way out of a bunker on the 12th hole. They double the bet. Kingslake gets his own back by cheating on the 13th. Drinkwater confronts him in the wood. They fight and Drinkwater beats Kingslake to death. Then he makes up this story about someone in a blue track suit. Both of them cheated. It seems unlikely. What? Golf being the last bastion of fair play? Something like that, yeah. Yeah, well... Well, whatever. Drinkwater's still got a lot of explaining to do. Hey, look... we need a map of the golf course. I need to know where that footpath goes to in both directions, where the road is, and, Jones, could you get hold of the local news media? This has got to be worth an appeal, hasn't it? You know, someone somewhere must know something. You know the form. And those incidents on the 13th hole - see if they were ever reported. Anything else? Well, if all that's a bit too much for you, Jones, you could always call on the widow yourself. No, thanks. Are you familiar with the expression 'golf widow', Inspector? Er, yes. Well, no. Erm... I have heard it used. He played golf every day, rain or shine. Then there were the committee meetings. And the bar afterwards, of course. So I'm used to being alone, you see. I've had lots of practice. May I ask, your late husband and Jerry Drinkwater - were they erm...very good friends? Well, Ali enjoyed bullying him. And Jerry put up with it. Maybe that passes for friendship in male circles. What about Miles Tully and Ed Monkberry? Actually, he's seen more of those two in the last couple of months. The three of them would spend hours on the putting green, banging on about some crisis at the club. Crisis? What crisis? How would I know? Golf chatter was banned in my presence. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Barnaby. 'Where are you, sir? ' I'm outside Martin Crisp's house. Chief Superintendent Cotton's been trying to reach you. What? 'I gave him your mobile number.' Oh, thank you, Jones. 'Did you get a map yet? ' Er...not yet, sir. Well, get on with it. 'Yes, sir.' (MOBILE RINGS) Chief Superintendent (! ) (TURNS OFF PHONE) That was our last summer at Pellings. My grandfather had already lost all his money. The house went in the next month or so. Look at him. Not a care in the world. Your father doesn't look too happy, does he? No, well, he knew which way the wind was blowing. My poor dear father. Worked himself into an early grave, paying off the debts. He saw it as his duty. Duty. Not a word you hear bandied about much now, is it? No, sir, you don't. My duty, as I see it, is to reclaim Pellings... for my children... and their children. Reclaim, eh? Buy it back, Inspector. Of course... it's worth a fortune now. We're nearly there. With a bit of luck, we'll be back in the family home by the end of next month. Actually, Mr Crisp, it was gambling at the club I came here to talk to you about. Well, it goes on. I've always tried to impose some sort of rule, but there's always stiff opposition. The view is that it's a private matter between members. If it doesn't impinge on other members, then... If Alistair Kingslake was killed because of a bet... ..would that qualify as impinging? Are you saying... Jerry Drinkwater killed Ali? Well, sir, I have to consider all the possibilities. I've played golf a couple of times...with Janet Painter. It's years ago. Do you remember? No, I don't. It was quite a good laugh. We even had a lesson with the pro. He said I had a natural swing. A natural what? Swing. (LAUGHS) Wait a minute. Did you say it's called Whiteoaks? I did. Well, that's the club Derek and Janet joined. It took them ages to get in. They were as pleased as punch. They had to eat a 12-course dinner as a kind of test. You know, eat your soup with your pudding spoon, you're out. So the Painters are members of the Whiteoaks club, are they? Well, they were. It was all Janet talked about for a while. Then Derek had some work problems, I think and they packed it in. They play badminton now. (GASPS) Badminton, Tom. (CHOKES AND COUGHS) No, Joyce! Yes, I'd say he was hit six or seven times. Blows are consistent with a golf club? Yes, but... Yes, but what, George? All the blows pretty much landed in the same place. Good grouping, in fact. The killer had a good eye. Yes, good hand-eye co-ordination. (MOBILE RINGS) It made it damned difficult separating one wound from another. But there's one that's slightly off target. And the angle's different. Sir, it's Chief Superintendent Cotton. Oh, not now. He's in a... Maybe that was the first hit. He was on his feet at the time and that would explain the angle. Could be. But there's something bothering me, Tom, and I need a bit more time. There's something bothering me too, George. If you'd hit a ball into that wood, would you have used a one iron to get out of it? Now you come to mention it, no. No, you use a one iron off the tee or on the fairway. If at all. There's an old saying: 'If there's lightning about, hold up a one iron. 'Even God can't hit a one iron.' What's this? I'm not sure, but it wasn't from a golf club. When he fell maybe. No, the bruising's too small, too symmetrical. A punch...during the struggle. No, it wasn't a fist. But whatever it was, it was sustained before the attack. Right, thank you, George. Thanks very much. Anything back from Forensics about those golf clubs? Not yet, sir, but I've got a map. Have you? Excellent. Stick a few pins in it. That'll look good. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Hello? 'Mr Monkberry.' It's Sergeant Jones. It's about your statement. 'When would be a good time to meet? ' Oh, erm.... No, I'm a bit erm... Mr Monkberry, is everything OK? Oh, yes, yes. Um... Well, I'm not quite sure to be honest. I've just had rather an odd phone call. What sort of phone call. Oh, look, it's probably nothing. Where are you? I can meet you. I'm in Lovewood's Lane, near the club. Lovewood's Lane. Lovewood's Lane. (HANGS UP PHONE) What are you doing here? Did you get a phone call too? Got it. Yeah, I'll meet you there. Hello? (TOOTS HORN) (TYRES SCREECH) Idiot! How many times do I have to tell you, Darren? Solids to the left, liquids to the right. Sorry, Mum. Liquids on the right. And we don't need to hear from you, thank you very much. Clyde, dear. How nice to see you. I bet it is. Have you got something for me? And when's Darren's next lesson with Becky Tunstall? Ah, well, we need to talk about that. What do you mean? Tunstall's put his foot down. He's put his foot down. He doesn't want Darren teaching Becky any more. But we had an agreement. Well, what can I do? Tunstall wants me to teach her. I am the club pro, you know. Well...you'll have to pay the full interest rate, then. I'll be wanting another ã200 a month, starting now, Clyde. You should get rid of that silly car, dearie. Don't you "dearie" me. I will not be patronised by a jumped-up barmaid. Don't worry. Old man Tunstall will change his tune when I'm a full member. Darren, when will you learn to keep your mouth shut? This goes no further than these four walls, do you understand? Darren a member? Are you serious? Is that what the posh cutlery's in aid of? Practising for dinner with the president? Oh, this is great. Oh, this is hilarious. What's so funny about it, eh? Get off me, you twerp! Do something, Col! Bash him up! Good morning. Is this a bad moment? No, perfect. I was just leaving. You should have told me. Families, eh, Inspector? Families, indeed, Mrs Fountain. Lovely craftsmanship in that. It was my late husband's. He was steward at Whiteoaks before me. I use it to keep track of the housekeeping. You took over that job from him, did you? Yes, my husband was cut down in his prime, but the club saw fit to keep me on. It was a godsend with two small boys to bring up. What was it you wanted again? I wanted a word with Colin, if I may. Colin? What about? Oh, it's nothing very much. Well, he just popped out, as you saw. Ah, yes, well, he can't have gone very far, so I'll take a look. He might be feeding the pig. I'll take you. No, don't you trouble yourself. Don't worry. I'll follow my nose. Oh, he won't say anything. Of course he won't. My handsome boy. Mr Fountain... Colin. I'd like to talk to you about the day Alistair Kingslake was killed. (PIG SQUEALS) Mr Kingslake said that Jerry Drinkwater cheated on the 12th hole, didn't he? Come on, Colin. You were there. You told Mr Kingslake that Jerry Drinkwater had played out of the bunker fair and square. But he didn't, did he? Did he, Colin? No. No. So why did you cover for him? Mr Kingslake was a rude man. Oh, so you did it to annoy Mr Kingslake? Yeah. He was extremely annoyed. It was funny. I didn't like Mr Kingslake... but I didn't kill him. No, I don't think you did, Colin. He's not gonna get her. I'm sorry, who's not going to get who? My brother Darren. Becky Tunstall would never go out with him. Would she? I'm sorry, Colin. I can't help you there. Hello? Mr Monkberry! Mr Monkberry? (BUSHES RUSTLE) Hey! Hey, you! Argh! Look out, man! Did you see him? Who? A man in blue. A man in blue fleeing the scene of a crime. DS Jones, isn't it? (BREATHLESS) Oh...hello, sir. What on earth is going on, Sergeant? Well, there's a dead body... sir. (PANTS) Multiple stab wounds to the abdomen, Tom. And no cuts on his hands or his arms? No. No defensive wounds. The attack took him by surprise, then. No time to defend himself. Or maybe he wasn't surprised because he knew his assailant. What was that he said to you? He said he'd had an odd phone call. The killer, do you think? No sign of his mobile, I suppose. No, no. Just his wallet. There's no cash or credit cards in it, though. So this person in the blue tracksuit actually exists. Yes, indeed. Spooky place. Time was I'd have given my eye teeth to be a member here. I'll stick to Causton Municipal, thank you very much. Me too. Oh, the Chief Superintendent wants to talk to us at the clubhouse, sir. Well, the Chief Superintendent will have to wait. I want to look at the 13th again. So the killer must have known that Kingslake and his cronies were on the course. He waits for them to get to the 13th tee, and when they do, he watches them through that periscope. So he knows who's hit which ball? Exactly. Now, he wants to lure Kingslake into the woods. But Kingslake hits a great shot off the tee. So the killer snaffles the ball and then goes into the woods. Why would Kingslake bother looking for it? The ball could have gone anywhere. You'd play another one off the tee. Yeah, that's been bothering me too. Maybe, Jones, maybe he didn't have to look for a ball at all. Do you remember that bruise on his forehead? The ball was thrown at him. Now, from what we know of Mr Kingslake, there's only one way he'd react to something like that, isn't there? Right. He grabs a club at random... Hence the one iron. ..and heads off to confront whoever chucked his ball. He gets jumped, has his club taken off him - No, not necessarily, Jones. Not necessarily. George Bullard is worried about one of the blows to Kingslake's head. I don't want to jump the gun, but I reckon in a day or two George will come to us and tell us that the blow was done by a different club. You want some? Because I'm ready if you are. The subsequent blows were delivered by Kingslake's club in order to disguise or obscure the first blow. (SQUELCHING) Good hand-eye co-ordination, says George Bullard. He's a golfer, Jones. A golfer. That cheered you up, has it, sir? Look, I know you think I've got a prejudice against the golfers. And I have. But I've put it to one side for the moment. The truth, Jones, is all I'm interested in, I promise you. Well, I'm sure that'll please the Chief Superintendent. Will you stop worrying about the Chief Superintendent? He's waiting for us back at the club house. Is he? Yep. Oh. Now, of course, we can't be sure until the pathologist has completed his final examination. But it looks likely that Mr Kingslake was struck by two golf clubs, one of which might have belonged to, or been in the possession of, his assailant. So this thug was wandering around with a golf club? I think Inspector Barnaby is suggesting the murderer is a member of this club. Indeed I am, sir, because that is a possibility. A member? Ridiculous. Drinkwater saw the murderer running away. Monkberry was stabbed and had his cash and credit card stolen. Sergeant Jones saw the thug in the blue track suit with his own eyes. Gentlemen, Inspector Barnaby will do everything in his power to make sure that the club and its members are treated with tact, and discretion, isn't that right? Tom? Yes, yes, tact and discretion. I think, John, you might mention the possibility of opening the front line. Yes, of course. I don't see any reason why the front line hole shouldn't be open for play from Monday, do you, Barnaby? They're well away from the SOCs. I'll be playing over at Chedgrave Park for the time being. I think it's best if I keep my distance. I quite understand, John, and thanks for all your help. A word, Barnaby. I would appreciate it, Barnaby, if you would take my calls now and then. Yes, I'm sorry. You know, it's been a bit...hectic. Of course. Of course. Do you play golf, Tom? Perhaps you'd like to join me at Chedgrave Park? No, I do not play golf, John. I always thought it a bit unsporting, you know, hitting a stationary ball. The more's the pity. I play, sir. I want a daily progress report. I am disappointed in you. It was worth a try. Do you play? Yeah. (PHONE RINGS) Jones. Something's come up, sir. There isn't a trace of blood on Drinkwater's clubs or Tully's and Monkberry's. But there was an assault on Crisp's Folly a couple of years ago. A bloke called Derek Painter was attacked. Derek Painter? Yeah. Here's the interesting thing. The police were called by Harry Claypole, one of the village members. Who has no recollection of any incidents on the 13th hole. He's here now, in the cooler. TV: (CROWD CHEERS) (KNOCK ON DOOR) TV: 'Sam, now we've seen a demonstration of the lob wedge, 'could you now show us a chip and run? ' Morning. We'd like a word, Mr Claypole. Alone, if you don't mind. Watch out, Harry. Looks like they've caught up with you at last. How can I help you, Inspector? TV: (CROWD CHEERS) Have another go. To the left of the hole. To the left of the hole, Becky. OK, one more time. Hello, Colin! Yeah. I came across Mr Painter on Crisp's Folly. He was up by the periscope in some distress. He'd been attacked. So I got to the club house and phoned the police. Did Mr Painter ask you to phone the police? No, that was the thing. When I told him, he got quite shirty. Said there was no point wasting their time when he hadn't got a look at whoever it was. OK, so the police arrive. Yeah, they didn't speak to me. They were only here five minutes. Had a word with Mr Tunstall and Mr Painter and left. Mr Tunstall. Yeah, he sorted it out. He was quite annoyed about me phoning the police as well. Very concerned about the club's image, is Mr Tunstall. Anyway, next time I stayed well out of it. Next time? Er... Oh, nothing. Mr Claypole. Well, Jerry Drinkwater was playing Crisp's Folly last year. He come out the rough with a bloody nose. Said he walked into a tree. A few months after, Clyde Patchett was found in a bunker, doubled up, crying like a baby. Caught himself in a sensitive spot with his sand wedge, he said. Bit odd, though, him being a professional, and so on. Were either of the Fountain brothers around at the times of these events? You're never far from a Fountain at Whiteoaks. The Fountains seem to be an institution round here, don't they? Oh, yeah, the wonderful Mrs Fountain. The sun shines out of her, all right. As long as there's no money involved. Now, what can you mean by that? That woman's so tight, she squeaks when she walks. I did some work for her. Put a new concrete floor in that damned pigsty of hers. That was three years ago. She still owes me half the money. You should have told us about the attack on Mr Painter before. Yeah, I know, I know, but I didn't want to... Didn't want to cause any trouble for the club, did you? Look, there's a captain's committee meeting day after next. They're proposing new members. The captain, Mr Crisp, he's put me up for full membership. I'd be the first village member to become a full member. Mr Crisp thinks it's about time things were a bit more... democratic around here. Good for him. He's a good bloke - Mr Crisp. There's no side to him. He manages the White Lion Hotel in Causton, you know. You'll even find him serving behind the bar when they're short. So he understands people like me. He's got a bit of respect. Well, Mr Claypole, I hope you succeed. They have to vote unanimously, of course, but I'm well liked around here. I'm sure you are. All I've got to get through then is the president's dinner. Bit of an ordeal, is it? Oh, yes. Curtains if you pick up the wrong fork. Like teeing off with your putter, you're out. I'd be grateful if you didn't discuss this membership thing with anyone. It's not done to discuss things in public. Don't you worry, Mr Claypole. Your secret is safe with us. Thank you. We need to talk to this Derek Painter bloke. I'll get his details off the secretary. No need. I know how to get hold of him. Derek Painter was a friend. He used to be a member here. But he packed it in rather suddenly. Now, Jerry Drinkwater. Never keep a car longer than three years. Depreciation's terrible. Have you got a minute, please? Er... Er... Later would be better for me or tomorrow. No, now, please, Mr Drinkwater. (TOOTS HORN) (DOOR CLOSES) Are you just moving in, Mr Drinkwater, or moving out? Oh. Moving out. (PHONE RINGS) Place is getting too small. Growing family and so on. (MACHINE BEEPS) MRS DRINKWATER ON MACHINE: 'It's me. I've had enough. We're in Dorset. 'Don't follow us. I mean it, Jerry. 'Don't you dare try to speak to the children until my solicitor -' (TURNS OFF MACHINE) My wife's a bit depressed at the moment. It's the move. Mm. We want to talk about the day Alistair Kingslake was killed. For God's sake, I've told you everything. But you haven't, sir. You didn't tell us about the bet you had on with Alistair Kingslake. Bet? What bet? Mr Drinkwater, if I suspect from this moment on that you are telling me something that is less than the complete truth, Jones here will handcuff you, take you to Causton Police station and charge you with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Are we clear? Now, look - Are we clear about that? OK, all right. It was a few quid, that's all. 500. If you say so. And he accused you of cheating, didn't he? As good as. The nerve of the man. But you did cheat, Mr Drinkwater, didn't you? Now, just you hold your horses. Just you hold on. OK, all right. I told him I'd got out of the bunker in one. I'm ashamed to say it was a lie. I've never done anything like that before in my life. Never. But I was sick to death of Kingslake's bullying, sick of him bullying me with his damned money. So you doubled the bet on Crisp's Folly. Yes. A grand. What an idiot. There was no way I could pay him if I lost, but if I won, well... ..the pleasure of taking a thousand smackers off Kingslake... That man hated losing, believe me. So what happened? His tee shot was in the trees. Gone. The next thing I knew, there's his ball in the middle of the fairway. So you thought he'd cheated. Yes, it was impossible. I went after him to tell him what I thought of him. There he was... lying there. Body all twisted. I didn't kill him, I swear and I didn't kill Ed Monkberry. I know you didn't kill Ed Monkberry because you were visiting Eileen Fountain, Mr Drinkwater, at the time, weren't you? Was I? Yes, you were. Until you saw me. What were you doing there? Oh, catering committee stuff. Deadly dull. (CLICKS HANDCUFFS) I... I had an arrangement with Mrs Fountain, a private arrangement. (SNAPS HANDCUFFS SHUT) She was good enough to lend me a small sum of money... to tide me over. I was paying her back. You were borrowing money from Eileen Fountain? Well, I've known Mrs Fountain for years. She's been very kind. It was just to tide me over... so I could keep on playing golf. I've lost everything else, you see. Now that's gone as well, I suppose. Want to buy some clubs? We decided it was time we got more active, didn't we, Tom? Yes, we did, absolutely. We were thinking maybe badminton. So we came along for a look. Badminton or golf. Golf? Joyce has a natural swing. Aren't you investigating those terrible murders at Whiteoaks? Yes, I am, for my sins. Funnily enough, we were thinking of joining Whiteoaks at one point. Oh, wait a minute. Aren't you two members? Erm...not any more. Don't talk to me about that place. Oh, what happened? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. No, of course you don't. No, I want to. Tom might as well know. I had a problem with gambling. That's the long and the short of it. The one thing that kept me out of trouble was golf. Until I joined Whiteoaks. Does gambling go on up there? Oh, it certainly does. I was down a couple of grand with nothing but change in my pocket. So I was pointed in the direction of someone who could help. Was that someone, by any chance, Eileen Fountain? That's right. The steward. Turns out she's the club's unofficial banker. Who pointed you in her direction? Will Tunstall. He was the one I owed money to. I should have listened to Martin Crisp. You've probably heard his story. Losing that lovely house. Yes, after the membership committee voted us in, Martin Crisp took me to one side and warned me about the gambling element. So you borrowed money from Eileen Fountain to pay off your gambling debts to Will Tunstall. Keeping it in the family, he called it. And I fell a couple of weeks behind with the payments. One day I find myself in the trees on Crisp's Folly and Colin, Eileen Fountain's great lump of a son, looms out of nowhere and roughs me up. What? Derek, you should have come to me. Anyway, we put our heads together and managed to pay it all off. So, no more Whiteoaks for us. Stick to badminton. That's my advice. What's it for? Shut up, we're counting. We're helping a friend, a very good friend who will help us in return. But that's all we've got, that's everything. Spread it thin, dad always said. Shouldn't you be feeding a pig or something? She doesn't really like you. She's just pretending. She's just winding you up. Ugh! Stop it, both of you, this minute! I decide what's best for this family. Darren, get on with your work. And, you... get out and don't come back until you've calmed down. You aren't going to get her. Ah, the map. Very nice. Monkberry's body was found here, sir, just off the footpath, about 100 yards away from where Kingslake was found. And the assaults on Drinkwater and Painter? Here, sir, where Kingslake was found. And Clyde Patchett's alleged groin injury occurred in this bunker here. Ah, Crisp's Folly again. Right, so, Painter and Drinkwater assaulted here. Yes, thank you, Jones. Been there, done that. What did Miles Tully have to say for himself? He said the meetings at Kingslake's house were about the membership committee. They were worried about candidates that Martin Crisp is putting up like that Claypole bloke. (POSH VOICE) Not our sort of chap, don't you know? Transpires, Jones, that Eileen Fountain runs a very, very lucrative money-lending operation. Well, well. That nice Mrs Fountain. That nice Mrs Fountain. Painter borrowed a couple of grand from her at extortionate rates to cover his losses and so did Jerry Drinkwater. And heaven knows how may others. Offering loans without a licence. Consumer Credit Act, 1974. And Colin found him. He strong-arms those people who fall behind with their payments. Well, that's extortion. Let's pull 'em in. No. Let them be for the minute, while we work out the connection with those two murders. Is there a connection? I mean, Kingslake had money. He didn't need any loans and Monkberry wasn't a gambler. So we could still be looking for a local bad boy. There's got to be a connection, Jones. Will Tunstall, it was, who delivered Derek painter into the delicate clutches of Eileen Fountain. So let's go ask him why the president of Whiteoaks Golf Club touts for a loan shark? Yeah. Have you got the money? I'll have the money by the end of the day. I've heard all that before. I had the money six months ago and you put the price up. Because you took so long about it and the market went up. Do you expect me to sell you an asset at less than the market price? Dad, that policeman's here. Well, actually, this isn't terribly convenient. It'll only take a minute. I'm off to the club for a lesson, dad. Who with? Don't get stressed. It's with Clyde, OK? Well, I'd better be getting along. No, no, Mr Crisp. Stay where you are. I'd like you to hear this too. Have you caught the murderer, Inspector? No, this concerns Eileen Fountain. It is alleged that she's been lending money to members of Whiteoaks. Well, if Eileen wants to lend people a few quid here and there, surely that's her business. Colin's been using force to extract repayments. Now, did either of you know about this? Certainly not. Mr Tunstall? No, of course not. Mr Crisp, thank you. I'd like to talk to Mr Tunstall alone now, please. Yes, well, I have a committee meeting to prepare for. Gambling, Will... that's what's brought us to this sorry state. You and me, both. Spare me the sermonising, Martin. And, Martin? What? So, you don't know anything about Mrs Fountain's money lending? Am I missing something here? Never mind Mrs Fountain. Two men have been murdered. Two damned good friends of mine. We have a witness who said you did. He claims you recommended her. That makes you an accomplice, Mr Tunstall. That's outrageous. You wait till my friend John Cotton hears about this. I'll be reporting it to the Chief Superintendent later on today, sir, so it won't be a very long wait. Somewhere along the line, someone got their wires crossed. Perhaps. Perhaps I didn't fully take on - Mr Tunstall, thank you very much. That will be all for the time being. Get hold of George Bullard. I want to talk to him right away. Sir? Oi! Ha ha ha! Sometimes I love this job. Tom, I've had a bit of a breakthrough. You know I was worried about those blows to Kingslake's head? Two different clubs. Yes... That's right. Do you know what sort yet? There's something about the injuries I'm still trying to work out. If I may humbly suggest, George, take a look at Monkberry here. Six stab wounds to the right side of the abdomen. George... Six stab wounds to the right side. (LAUGHS) Of course. Oh, damn! Damn! I don't get it. The murderer was left-handed. The first blow to Kingslake's head was with a left-handed golf club. Which means the shape of the indentation was reversed. That's what confused me. So we're looking for a left-handed golfer. Yeah. There can't be that many at Whiteoaks. Well, there is one that springs to mind. Oh, and Martin? Martin Crisp. He's a leftie. Crisp? Remember that impromptu lesson you had on the 13th fairway? See, we've been looking at the gambling and we should have been looking at a house. The house Crisp's grandfather lost in a bet? Yeah. Pellings. How much is it worth? Two million? Three million? More? How does a hotel manager manage to raise that kind of money? I don't know, but how does killing Monkberry and Kingslake help? They were part of the membership committee along with Tully. Do you remember the meetings that the three of them had? They didn't like the fact that Crisp was considering Claypole for membership. So? I think Martin Crisp had someone much more controversial lined up. Someone the three of them wouldn't vote for in a million years. So he gets rid of two of them. That leaves Miles Tully. And the committee meeting's today. We'd better find him. Thank you, George. My pleasure. Is er...everything in order... Mrs Fountain? Oh, yes, Mr Crisp. Everything is very much in order. Just the man. Martin, you wanted to see me. Yes, I thought we might play a couple of holes together. There's something I'd like your advice on. Well, of course. I'd be delighted. Thank you, Mrs Tully. We'd better get a move on. He's gone to the club to have a drink with Crisp. So Crisp borrows money wherever he can. He scrimps, he saves. Finally, he gets enough money together to buy Pellings. But then Tunstall raises the price...again. So there he is, still wanting more cash. And who does he turn to? Eileen Fountain. Eileen Fountain. But she wants something in return, doesn't she? Membership for her beloved Darren. Becky, wait a minute. What is it? I want to talk to you. It's important. I'm late for my lesson with Clyde. Dad will kill me if I miss it. It won't take long. I want to take you out tonight. I'll have something to celebrate. I can't, Darren. Tomorrow night, then. Sorry, darling, but no. You're a sweet boy, Darren. You really are. And we have fun. I'm not going out with you, OK? I'm gonna be a member, Becky. What are you talking about? A full member, here at the club. The committee's going to vote me in today. Even if that's true, which I doubt very, very much, sweetheart, it doesn't make any difference. Why not? You and me, darling, we're never gonna be an item, are we, what, with my dad and everything? But we can still see each other, here at the club, can't we? Now and then. (MOBILE RINGS) What is it, Colin? 'Mum wants to see you in the cooler now.' (SIGHS) Miles, I wanted a word about the committee meeting this evening. What about it? Well... I wanted to talk about the candidates for membership. You know we're not supposed to discuss that, secret ballot and so on. Yes, I know, but this is somewhat of an emergency. I need your help. If this is about Harry Claypole, then I'm sorry, Martin, I can't support him for membership. This isn't about Claypole. You can black-ball Claypole by all means. I'm talking about Darren Fountain. Darren? ! Darren Fountain? Are you serious? Completely. Everyone on the committee will approve him. I hope you will as well. No way, Martin. Absolutely no way. (BALL HITS TREES) Oh, dear. I seem to have pulled it into the rough. Ah, Darren, let me buy you a drink. Big day today. Where's Mum? Well, she isn't here, Sonny Jim. Come on, what'll it be? This may be your last chance. No, thanks, Harry. I've got a lot on my mind. You may not see me in here again after today. Colin? Colin, open this door. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) I'll tell Mum. Colin! Oh, hello, Becky. Oh, Clyde. We're supposed to be having a lesson. Sorry. A touch of food poisoning. Hello, Becky. I mean, crying out loud, Martin. Think about it, Darren Fountain in the bar as a member? Ordering drinks from his mother? I'm sorry you see it that way. I think mine went in over there. Help me have a look, would you? I'm not a snob! Absolutely not a snob! But a place like Whiteoaks, it's a delicate balance, isn't it? I mean, we have to preserve that balance, don't we? Otherwise, what's the point of it being a club in the first place? We've been friends a long time, Miles. This is very important to me. So I'm asking you as a favour. No can do, Martin, for Ed and Ali's sake. Anyway, what's so important about Darren Fountain becoming a member? We'll never find it, Martin. Might as well reload. Isn't that it there? Ahh! Ohh! Oh, please, don't hit me. I just want my house back. Let it go! Let it go! Ahh! (WHIMPERS) Still think golf's a boring game, sir? (POLICE RADIO IN DISTANCE) Sir? Let's have a look. That's blood, isn't it? Yep. Look at this. (MOBILE RINGS) Jones. Uh-huh. Right, OK. A commotion up at the club house. Something about the Fountains. It's high time we rounded up the Fountains. Come on, let's go! Come on! Darren. Darren, where's Colin? How would he know? You don't have to say anything, Darren. I saw Colin leave about ten minutes ago with Becky Tunstall in the car. Becky? Mum, he's gone to get the money. Darren, shut up this minute. Mrs Fountain, would be that the money you were planning to give to Martin Crisp? I don't know what you're talking about. Where is Mr Crisp? I hope these shenanigans won't unduly affect the committee meeting. Mr Claypole, what was that job you did for Mrs Fountain? New floor and drainage in the pigsty. And you still owe me 600 quid, Eileen. It was a bodge. You're no better than a cowboy, Harry Claypole. Mrs Fountain, why would a woman as careful as you lavish money on a pigsty, I wonder? I don't know what you're driving at. You said Daddy was here. I've got something for you, Becky. Colin, you're hurting me. (PIG SNORTS) Is it vicious? No. As long as you don't move. Colin, you're starting to freak me out. Why do you like Darren more than me? Who said I did? You do, though, don't you? You never talk to anyone. Why should people like you if you don't talk to them? You're a bit scary, Colin. You're scaring me now. I'm going. Wait. Look... God. It's for you. Me? So you'll like me. No, Colin, that's not the way it works. Now let me go. Wait! All right, all right. You're all right now (SHOUTING) (PIG GRUNTS) So all the details were written in Eileen Fountain's ledger. Yes, her book-keeping was impeccable. And apart from Tully, Kingslake and Monkberry, everyone, every single man on that membership committee, was in hock to Eileen Fountain. They would have voted for the pig if asked. What about the builder chap? Claypole? Martin Crisp introduced him to test the water, to see what the reaction would be. Of course, Kingslake and co were outraged. So he knew that Darren Fountain wouldn't stand a chance. So Crisp had to eliminate the opposition. Yeah. Crisp's office had French windows, opened on to the golf course. He kept a little buggy, a little golf buggy, there all the time. People were used to him buzzing around in it. So he hid the buggy, got into his track suit, and waited by the periscope. Now, he was due to play a round of golf with Ed Monkberry. But Monkberry cancelled, so he had to improvise... with the knife. Do go and get changed, Tom. They'll be here in a minute. There's plenty of time. Oh, God. What? I forgot my bat. You mean, your racquet. Don't worry. Here it is. Oh, thank you, Joyce. What would I do without you? Not a lot. Oh! Here they are. You two are cruising for a bruising today. We're gonna run you ragged. You'd better get changed, Tom. We're on in five minutes. Absolutely. Ooh. Are you all right? Yeah, fine. No. Oh, I think I've tweaked my hamstring. Run it off, that's the thing. Yes, get on court and run it off. Right. You three, you can start without me.

Enough! . Move back, you dickheads! You got nine lives. You thought you could hurt me and get away with it? Why are you doing this? What's with you? Turned into a sissy, now, have you? Dachimawa Lee? What a loser! Dachimawa Lee? is there some mistake? Mistake? Why, you fuck! Where are your manners? You insist on disappointing me? To think I used to respect you! I've seen enough. Let's just chop his head off. Just one minute. You want to live? We could let you. Then you'd have to pay us back. Crawl under my legs and bark like a dog! But... Or we could show her a good time. Let me go! How could you do this to your own countryman? My country? Where I stand is my country. Seeds change according to the soil. You wilted and I bloomed! Boss! Wait! You're torn. Look, Dachimawa Lee is crawling! I said bark, you fuck! Wuff. Louder! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! You're so freakin' talented! You think your fist is all that? Why, it's all soft and mushy. Get up, you fuck! Go on, do your thing! Please... Bring it on, smart ass! That was fun. Boss, if we kill him now, it won't make us feel much better. His hands are useless now, so we can keep him here and torment him whenever we like. That sounds good. You're certainly worthy of being my blood brother. You're no better than a worm! We win! Mister! Get up, Mister! Come on! Are you up? Then help me with this. We have to burn all this and leave. What? Leave? They said they'd be back. Burning everything and running away is not the answer! I may not know who I am but I know what's right and what's wrong! Life is not about running away! You're all talk, you know that? Give me that. You don't even know who you are. What can you possibly do when you can't even use your arm? This is...! - Give me that. - My, God... You have a way out or what? - You shouldn't be reading this! - What is it! It's a romance novel. There might be more. It's hot! It's hot! Yeah. This is it! That's.. The knife inside isn't for cooking. It's the broken sword of a warrior. Your father wasn't a cook. He was a warrior turned hermit. Dammit! You're strutting your stuff! Come on, then. Why are you stopping, fucker! Feeling better now, Dachimawa Lee? Last time was no fun, so I waited until you got better. But seeing as you look fine, either you recovered real fast or I didn't hit you hard enough! It's all gone! You must have saved on bandages! I thank God for bringing you back. You just picked your day to die. The day is too nice to die alone. You all had your last meals, right? Why, you bastard! The one-armed swordsman! This is more and more interesting! Here are the tickets for you villainous bastards! What tickets? For the express train! Curiosity is killing me! I wonder what tickets Big Mouth with no balls got for us? Stop stalling and just blurt it out! All in good time. It's where all men of evil like you go, lt's going to be a long trip anyway. You don't mean...hell? Why, you! I'll send you on a one-way train! You're going nowhere near heaven anyway! What are you waiting for? . Off with his head! You're all tied up. Don't come any closer! I'm ready! I'm blocking! Pathetic to the end! Totally impenetrable... Hey, Boss! Fuck it! Oh, no! He cut me off! He's so handsome. Ow! Ouch! He's so strong! You bore me! I'll just have to fall! Faking it? Get up! I'm sorry, sir! Woo! Another beating! You're overacting. Ouch! I'm going to have to fall! You thought I couldn't remember who I was? Border Lynx and Mr. Wang! Both of you! You brought me both luck and misfortune. First, you trampled on my pride and gave me humiliating pain. But physical pain fades away! The greater pain was not knowing who I was. But when you hit me and I hit my head, the impact brought my memory back. - He's combing? - Then you are..? He looks fine. - Border Lynx! - Oh, dear. You shed crocodile tears on the train to Shanghai! Don't expect me to have mercy on you! Wait, sir! I know the whereabouts of the thing and the woman you're looking for. The thing is already in Switzerland. He said that a mole in your agency did this to you. The mole is... How could you, Boss? Switzerland? A mole in the agency? Mr. Wang! Stop! I need more answers from this tongue. Then I'll cut it for you myself. What's this? It's me! He's like the wind. Dachimawa Lee... Hurry! If we had met in good times we could have been friends. It's a shame. No way. We couldn't be friends anyway because of our age difference. Mister. Girl with no name. It's time for goodbye. Take this to remember me by. This was mine. Mister, Now that your memory is back, please tell me your name. Mister! Mister! You'll always be in my heart! I have no regrets now! International Conference Venue, Underground bunker, Switzerland Dachimawa Lee! What happened? Where have you been? I had a slight problem so I took a little detour. What about Agent Mari? Oh, no... Something doesn't add up. Only Agent Mari, you, Agent 6, and I knew about this mission. According to my sources, we have a mole in our midst. Where did you get that information? 3 minus 1 is 2. You and me makes 2. 2 minus 1 means one of us is the mole. Why don't you show your true colors? After you contacted me, I got busy and found out that the statue and the money will be taken from a secret safe and exchanged in Geneva. It won't be too late to continue our conversation there. What makes you so sure? The confidence of someone who holds the key to the truth. That's a rare commodity. You can't dodge an unexpected bullet. I leave the rest to you. Swiss Secret Dairy Bank That is the meeting place. Only the main participants can go in so you won't need back-up. So the truth will out. We'll see when we open it. Whether it's a treasure chest or a Pandora's box. Wait! You follow that Japanese fellow. I shall follow the Shadow Man. Chances are the statue is in the Japanese man's bag! Get the bag and meet me at the opera theater we talked about! The opera theater! I must hurry. All righty, then! Oh, beautiful. Oh, my God. Lamb? Oh, no, lamb. Oh, my God, this lamb! Oh, no, boring. Hey, lambster! Lambs out, fleas! Stop following me! Stop following me! Come here! Damanegi! - What's that freakin' snowball! - l don't know! Sayonara. Damanegi! Damn! That slippery little eel. Almost there! Why, that little-! Take that! All right! - Farewell! - My secret weapon! What a loser... Swiss National Opera Theater Over here! You're...? Shh! They might be listening to us. What happened? Everything was a plot. A plot? The mole in our agency is... Oh, no! Hide! That treacherous... So how do you feel now that your secret is out? What! You still have no idea... - Enough of your lies! - Look at this first! What! Yeon-ja! You still don't get it? The mole is none other than- So your efforts paid off. No! No! Not after everything I went through to find you... It can't be... I was one step ahead of you. Save your second rate drama for your buddy to hell! I faked my death. A precaution to counter the intel that the agency was tracking the mole. Actually, she's the daughter of the traitor. Then... I'm dying here! Unfortunately, Agent 9 lost his life to save mine. So instead, I became Agent 6 and continued with the mission. Then who are you? The real me? This is who... I really am. Then... That motorcycle was rigged. And you made me drive it on purpose even though I had the wrong license. Those bandits threw only rocks yet blood burst forth from your chest as if it had been hit with a bullet. Then the sidecar fell off. Everything was planned. One more thing. She was disguised as the Shadow Man but I found out who she was. And having lost the money to me and getting shot she came here to use you. Then what happens next? Seeing as you're still talking you're not the type to go quietly. Look at me. Who do I remind you of? - But you can't be! - Are you... Madam Jang, who died at your hand! She was my sister You two caused everything! That's not our fault! You can't say it's not your fault when she died in your hands. If you don't want a hole in your chest, give me the statue in the bag. I'd rather take this to hell where your sister is. No! Give me that! - lt's for indigestion! - l can't let you die twice! How touching. Let me! No! Enough of your tactics! No more warning shots. I have one last thing to say. I'm not interested. I know that you won't shoot me. Shut your trap! No! Love for your country may have faded but not the love you have for me! - Enough! - Take it! - Stop! - No! Mari! I hate you. I don't want to die. No use regretting it now, is it? Stop that. Just as my heart was finally ready to let in a new tenant... lt's getting dark in here. It actually is dark. I don't want it to end like this... The silicon in your breast will save your life. Don't lose hope! You have dreams no silicon can ever replace! Being with you in my final hour makes me feel like my dirty soul has been saved. Please know this one thing. Let us not say anything more. Mari! When you're tired with a scent, you replace it with a new one. Dogs attract dogs and blood draws blood. Just throw down your toy gun. Don't worry about me. Just shoot him! Feisty as usual, kitty cat! I'll let you live with the guilt of having killed Mari! Stop! Where's..? There's no need to hurry. I have a plan. Swiss Spy Hotel Hey, you! is the international spy conference being held here? Ah! Stop! Stop! Ok. Then please check this. Serve this specialty tonight to the people on this list. Make sure you put this in their drinks. Our company made a special list of people with jetlag. and giving vitamins as gifts. Yes,sir But how's the Golden Buddha? I'll take it. - Move it! - Yes, sir! We got the statue, so our mission is accomplished. I'd like to see the statue with the list of people who have been bothering us. Well, I just happen to.. have it right here. Oriental Express from Switzerland to Shanghai How can you laugh at a time like this? Our agents' lives are in danger. I can't believe you! How would they know our agents? What? Are you kidding me? Did you hurt your head? We lost the Golden Buddha again! Would this be it? Great! May I look at it first? Of course. What a big catch! But... Did Korean agents all get Japanese aliases? Let me see! International Spy Conference Japanese Delegation Kakemochi. Denkang. Nimai. Sumu. Idiot! This is cheap gilding. We're fucked! How could you not check it? It can't be! You'll be executed for disclosing top secret information and killing agents. Then you switched the list of Korean agents with Japanese agents. The mission felt wrong right from the start. So I set a trap just in case and Damanegi fell right into it. You didn't suspect me, too, did you? I'll have to choose my answer wisely. Wait, what happened to the money? It was the Japanese agency's anyway, so let's consider it gone. Too bad. So the mission was to lose both people and money. But we found each other. You're so handsome. Yeon-ja. - Come here. - This is exciting. This feeling of security. Many were sacrificed The Yalu River but we protected it. So it is indeed 'a sweet reward at the end of the road' We were all 'in synch' and our voices were 'as one'. But wait a minute. Where are Comrades Lee and Geum? Falkner Wind Power Plant Fleming Ranch, Pennsylvania, USA So this is how it all ends. After all, the mighty change history. Money and brains empower you, not your fist. Too bad for those who aren't aware of that. You mean life is all about deceiving each other? . While we take over these US plains, they'll forget about this money, and then we go back home to take over the positions left? It's a brilliant plan. What? - Excuse me, sir. - Who are you? Hold on. Hold on. What's the problem? There's a problem with the money you're spending. What? It is cash! I'm sorry, but they're counterfeits. Made in Japan. You lose. You can't be? It's a great day for a trip together. You backstabbing villains! How could this be? Then you are? They call me... Dachimawa Lee! Please, spare my life! - Men of evil! - l have to live! - Take the last - l have a reason to live! - express train - We are fellow countrymen.! - To hell! - No! What are you doing? What the... One, two, three! Keep spinning, you jerk! That's good! Spin him. round and round. A-ha! Bull's eye! Oh, my gosh! Oh, dear! They're gone. My lady. Why are you looking at me like that? Am I wearing too much make-up? No. Finally, everything is over. What about Mari who formed a love triangle with us? The only triangle in my life are triangular dumplings. Then I'll be the spicy filling in your dumpling. Even in the face of death? Nonsense. Don't say that. You must have resented me. How did you guess? Yeon-ja. I think it's time we said goodbye to this place. With you, always, Dachimawa Lee. Yeon-ja... Oh, my. - Finally... - l'm trembling. You tease. Help! Farewell. Action! So handsome! Previously on CSI Lou Gedda is getting away with murders. Warrick is a loose cannon,He was in Gedda's strip club, - conducting his own police investigation. - What do you want? Everything. No! I did not kill her. Grissom,you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl. You take this suspention,or you are fired. Guys like Lou Gedda,they don't skip on murder or extortion by being lucky. - I got an update for you. - Good work. Crime scene at the funeral. Can't get much deader than this. Liver temp certainly couldn't. He is being dead more the 24 hours Any indication what he died from? No,not a sign of trauma. I spoke with Mrs. Bell,she has no idea who the other DB from the casket is. Okay,thanks. That has got to be the biggest casket I've ever seen. This is the Alvis model. We are a fat country, Nick. Here is our proof. You don't think they come out the factory room for two though. No,the extra compartment is custom addition. This board is what seperated the two bodies. Top guy was just too heavy. Maybe it's the scandle to save money. Mortuary is obligated to bury indigents of no charge. Maybe save a burial plot by burying John Doe with John Smith. Go ahead,man,put him in a van,how dare you. - Stay here. - Guys,I'm just a coroner assistant. Caught you **,you are not going nowhere,man. Hold down,hold down now fellas,he is just doing his job. Mr. Bell is our first priority. We are gonna have him back here as soon as we can. Ok,you guys go help with the funeral band too? Yeah,buy another casket? 'cause that was donated by the community. - We'll pay for a new casket. - We will? Oh,man,this is disgrace right now,man. Hey,whoever put that other body in the casket is the one you should be angry with. Not us.Let us do our job. We'll put him in jail. This isn't right, man. Just go ahead and don't move yourself in. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Please,just... let my husband through. Please. CSI Season08 Episode17 For Gedda You are the mortician You are the one putting bodies into coffins So what, you have a two-for-one sale? Who is the extra stiff? You don't want to say anything,that's fine I'll just shut down the mortuary Maybe I'll book you on suspicion of murder For all I know,you killed the guy before you stuffed him in the coffin Lawyer You're under arrest Got to admit it's a pretty clever way to dispose of a body Who is gonna look under somebody else's tombstone Well,it's not exactly a new technique In the 1920's,Joe Bonanno used to dispose his hits in a double decker coffin What is this? More research for your mob book? I hope you are not starting to admire those slugs I don't admire them.But I'm grateful For what? Well,my book is done I have meetings with three different publishers in LA And I fly out the day after tomorrow I heard you were in here - Need any help? - Not really I've already collected trace off the body.I'm almost done with the coffin here Chaparral High football coach,ah? Hey, by the way, how much do I owe you I don't know, Warrick, don't worry about it. I always pay my debts.This should cover. What exactly about the Chaparral High state champs reminded you to pay me. Football always reminds me money. This is not football season. It's baseball but I don't bet baseball. Pure paycheck, babe. Hey Doc, you figure out what killed this guy yet? Yeah,found some petechiae consistent with suffocation Yeah, this should do it. You okay? Yeah,I know this guy. Or I knew him.He was a PI. You just saved yourself some work. His prints will be in the system. Thanks. Lenny Harper. We were in patrol together twenty some-odd years ago. Class cop. You sure we are talking about the same guy? I mean this guy got a list of complaints going up for right. until about the day he retired,at age 33. Vegas was a different town back then. You ruffled feathers, you got the boot. I... But soliciting prostitutes,extorting businese man and insurnce fraud. Kind of looks like he deserves to get the boot. Lenny always said the complaints were trumped up. This file,doesn't change the way we treat this case. Lenny was a cop.Cops are a priority. I want every man you got on this. Either this guy is a neat freak, or he's got one hell of a cleaning lady. Left his computer, that helps. Hey,Nick,is there a trash can under that desk? Yeah. - Is there a liner in it? - Yeah,why? There is no liner in this one. And the paper shredder has been emptied. Looks like somebody cleaned up after they cleaned up. This care is as clean as a whistle. The floor mat's still damp. I think it has just been detailed. What if the killer used the victim's car to transport the body? He drives the victim's own vehicle back to the funeral home. Stuffs the body and double deckered coffin, hits a car wash comes back, cleans out the office, and leaves us the keys. It's pretty considerate. Or very smart. How did you get this number? Is this some kind of a joke? What the hell do you want? Should I bring my own shovel? Get anything off that computer? No, hard drive's been wiped clean. What about the shredder? Nothing but a couple of strips from a folder and a few receipts. But I got a court order on Mr. Harper's email accounts. He had quite a few. One that handled mostly family stuff. One that handled new customers. And a work account. The work account have online backup systom. That's what I'm in now. So you basically got everything that was on his computer? I even have stuff he erased. There's a file in here you might think is interesting. P.I.'s like to use a lot of audio and visual surveillance. Insurance policy. This one was even taping his own meetings. Really? All right, so it's March 17, 2008. Meeting with Client #333. This is from inside his Escalade, yesterday. She did it with a cop. I spit on her, she deserve what she got. This's as close to a confession as you ever gonna get. I'm gonna bury that guy Lenny, I'm gonna bury you. Warrick couldn't investigate Gedda himself so he had the PI to do it for him. Archie tracked down thousands of photos, sound byte files, videos. Everything is connected to Lou Gedda. I thing Gedda caught Harper to spying on him, killed him, and had the mortician put the body in the double-decker casket. This is Waccick Brown. Leave your name and number Warrick, call me, now. Anybody hears from him, I want to know. You got it. Where the hell have you been? Grissom, I got to talk to you. - Where are you. - Pigalle. What are you thinking. I don't know. I don't know. You don't...you don't know what? I don't know what I did here.I don't know what happened, - I just woke up... - Police! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! - Warrick? - On the ground! Now! I'm a CSI! Drop the gun! Warrick Grissom, I... I don't know what happened. Local merchant heard gun shots, called 911. I responded code 3 with back up. There was no one else in the building. Thanks.Listen, could you give us just a minute? What happened? I don't know. My head is throbbing. - Is that your gun? - Yeah. Are those your cuffs? I guess so. We need to get you a lawyer. - Grissom. - Don't say another word. - Jim... - Just get on your feet. Listen to me.I don't know what happened. It's for your own good. Keep your mouth shot 'till we get to the station. You couldn't just let it go. The 419 went out as as officer involved no details. We got here as quick as we could. What the hell happened? Gedda is dead. Put your kits away. Day shift will be processing the scene. IA is taking the case from now on. Turn around. Hands up, I'll check for GSR. - Get a lawyer. - I don't want one. This isn't going away, Warrick. 48 hours they're gonna charge you. I wouldn't know what to tell a lawyer anyway. I'm have to take your cloth. Sign here. OK, thank you very much. - Were you just talking to IA? - Yes. What'd you tell'em? I'm not supposed to talk about it,I signed an admonishment. I don't care.What did you say? I said that i saw Warrick sitting in Grissom's office in the dark. So what? So he got a phone call, and he got rude pissed at the person he was talking to. So what? Then he was found a hour later in a pool of Gedda's blood. You don't know what happened in there. Look, Nick, All I did was tell the truth as I saw it. It's what we are supposed to do, right? I don't remember what happened. Is that what you are going going with? Really? That's what the truth is. OK, for the record then. Are you claiming memory lost from possible concussion or the hysterical amnesia following a traumatic incident. Like I told you, I just don't remember what happened. You remember hiring Lenny Harper to investigate Lou Gedda? - In violation of direct orders? - Yeah. You think Gedda was responsable? I'd bet on it. I've heard that about you. Is that why you went to Pigalle? I went to Pigalle because Gedda called me. Your coworkers corroborate a call, so we pulled your cell records. Came from a disposable phone which meas it could come from anybody. No, it came from Lou Gedda. I suppose that's possible. We do seem be jogging your memory. Let's keep that ball rolling, what happened next? - I went down there. - Alone? Yes. Unarmed? No. Gedda, you called me. Next thing I remember... I don't remember anything that happened out there. Uh...you left out the best part. I guess that's the ...amnesia. You want me to fill inthe blank? Your gun... with blood, tissue and hair at the scene. Your handcuffs on the vic. You... covered in blood. You went to pigalle to get revenge by giving lou gedda a taste of his own medicine. You're a csi. What's the evidence telling you? The evidence is... the evidence is suggesting that I did it. Okay. You think this is some kind of a joke, eh? - You think this is a joke, right? - You're making a mistake. - I don't know what happened. - You're digging a hole. You understand what I'm saying? - I don't know what happened! - Let go of my jack. okay, the rods are in place according to the autopsy report. Conrad. Gil, we're processing warrick's case evidence. You shouldn't even be in here. I'd like to see the files. Well, they're not done yet. We're still finalizing our conclusions. Yeah, but if I could see the raw test data, I could draw my own conclusions. I'll get you copies of the reports. - You'll have them in a couple of hours. - Thanks. Excuse me, detective. May I have a few minutes with csi brown? Why? I'm a friend. Well, he sure needs one of those. - Be my guest. - Thank you. How you holding up? That depends. Do you think I did it? I can't discuss the case. Yeah. I don't know, I think I'd just feel a lot better if I had a change of clothes. I hate being dressed like a convict. I'll take care of it. Stay strong. We're not through yet. Okay, um... let's... let's back up a little bit. You get involved with a pretty young thing. You go away to do your business. She winds up dead. You ever think about that? I think about joanna every day. There's not a day that goes by I don't think about her. No, I'm sorry. I was talking about holly gribbs. You remember holly, don't you? Rookie csi you left alone at a crime scene eight years ago to go place bets for a crooked judge. Suspect came back and shot her. I remember. Poor innocent girl just trying to do her job. She winds up dead because of you. That has nothing to do with this. Do two points make a straight line? It's a pattern of behavior. Reckless, obsessive, compulsive, self-destructive behavior. Twenty Four Year Old Pigalle Blvd.Stripper Found Slain in Parking Lot. What are you doing here? I just stopped by to get warrick a change of clothes. All right, take something out of the drawers-- nothing laid out or in the laundry. Detective: You get holly killed, then you get joanna killed. You just can't take any more, so you kill gedda. That's how a jury's going to see it. There's nothing I can do about that. Sure there is. Look, lou gedda was a slime ball. That's common knowledge. That was a problem for him. What's not to be proud of? You pay attention. You're hungry. Most of the time you know what you're doing. I've noticed that. I appreciate that. Now, I don't want you to think I'm being insensitive, but we're going after American Airlines. Well, it's... I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. Okay. I'm meeting at the University Club with Shel Keneally. Tonight, actually. Get everything rolling. If anything, I'd like you on board. I want you leading the way on this thing. I think I am uncomfortable. I don't think I should do that. It just happened. I haven't even cried yet. Of course. It was inappropriate. I'm sorry for your loss. Can you come in here with the papers I asked for? Sweetheart. You mind? I need you to set a meeting. A quiet place, but public. Have a heart-to-heart with Henry Lamont. Why would I do that? Because we're cutting him loose. Duck's having a meeting with Shel Keneally from American Airlines tonight. He's letting them know that Mohawk is over. And that gets us a pitch? It sends a signal that we're serious. And that we're willing to do whatever it takes. He has nothing. And this is more of it. - It's desperate. - Come on. You should be salivating to rip these guys away from DDB. And even if we don't win this account, we're going to be on a list in the New York Times of big boys pitching for this business. We have an airline. What kind of company are we going to be? The kind where everyone has a summer house? I can't believe I look like an idiot for wanting to be loyal to these people. Take off your dress. You get a chance at American Airlines, you take it. End of discussion. Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone? Of course. Forget it. Mr. Campbell. Don. Do you have a minute? What do you want, Campbell? I just was... I don't know. It's not a good time. If you want, you can leave him a note. People do that. No. Thank you. Good night, Joan. Did you see who did this? No. I never would have guessed you were in your 30s. People should not bring their personal problems into the office. I agree. Is it so hard to just leave everything at the door and just do your job? I look forward to it. They can't stand it. They'll drag you into the garbage out there. They just want you to be as miserable as they are. I say let them have it. Thanks. How are you, Don? Henry. Sit down. Can I get you anything? You know, I'm glad you picked this place. It reminds me of Pearl Harbor. For many reasons. Do you think you're not going to have to say it? Sterling Cooper has decided to end its relationship with Mohawk Airlines. Sterling Cooper. I'm sorry. It wasn't my decision. You know, when we came in there, they all said Sterling Cooper is Don Draper. That's what you get. That talk you gave me about us growing together. You said Sterling Cooper didn't need a big airline. You were going to make us a big airline. I wish things hadn't worked out this way. I'm almost embarrassed to say this. You fooled me. Stockholders weren't remotely impressed with firing our head of ops. So this agency change, well, that's going to be a process. And to be part of that process? - Listen, we're here talking, right? - Of course. But it's hard for me to leave here comfortable unless I know what your objections are. Well, we're a few steps away from objections. We're just sticking a toe in the water. Well, we're not. We jumped in. Pete. It's good to see you. Shel, this is Pete Campbell. I don't think he's our best. I think he's the best. Pleased to meet you. You as well. I was just telling my buddy Shel here how we've really cleared the way to be in this. I was telling Duck here we don't know where we are yet. I don't think you're aware of the level of commitment and enthusiasm for this project at Sterling Cooper. It's true. We've got writers bucking the gate. I've already got a stack of ideas on my desk that I think you'd love to see. We understand how delicate the process of rebuilding the public's confidence will be. Not just the public. Our stockholders. Well, I want you to know that, should you decide to bring us your business, there will be someone on your account who knows exactly what you're going through. My father was on that plane. My goodness. Sorry to hear that. Yes. Well... it's a horrible thing. Hopefully, something good will come of it. That is something I will pass on. Shall we grab a bite? I put our name in. I'm not your waitress, but are you all set here? Excuse me? You've been sitting alone a long time. Can I get you a menu? I don't think so. I have to drop this off, but I can swing back around on my way out. Not tonight. Would you hold him for me? Thanks. Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA Synchro: Hutch Season 2 Episode 2 "Flight 1" Sounds like the place. I couldn't believe there were two parties on this block. I have no problem with Negroes. I'm just worried about the car. We can still go home. This was your idea. It's important that we're here... for you. - For the people that work for you. - Lovely, go easy on that. - Some of them don't feel that way. - Is my nose running? - How are you? - Hi. Sorry about that, buddy. What did you do with your coats? We left them in the car. When we called to get directions from somewhere else in New Jersey, Paul gave Harry the idea. I took my purse. I smell alcohol, but I Don't see it. - It's him. - It's a party. Cosgrove's doing great. - Let's go get a drink. - I'm going to stay here. Come with me. So you work for these stuffed shirts? I work with them. - Glad to see a familiar face. - Yes. How are you? Introduce us to your friend. Eugene, whom I just met, was telling me that at Princeton Paul used to dress up like a girl. According to him, that's the way Shakespeare did it. Looking stunning, as always. Much too good for him. What are you doing out here? Not enough subterraneans in the Village? I'm here because this isn't Greenwich Village. This is America. How do you get to the city? The number 33 bus takes you right to Port Authority. Trust me, Montclair is the knees. We have Globe Trotter Antiques. We have the Wellmont Theater. Silent movies with organ. The Montclair Art Gallery. George Inness. - Have you heard of him? - Of course I have. Come. Enjoy. Imbibe. You're a button, you know that? And you're drunk. Can't get Donna here on my desk because she keeps refusing. You're not allowed to do that. I can't feel my cheeks. I can. I feel them fine. My mother says when you can't feel your cheeks, it's time to stop. Well, whatan I do with this? There. That works. My God. Don't you and Kitty have some place to be? Apparently, when they say "on call," it does not mean "available by phone." You have to be in the hospital. I'm sorry he didn't make it. I'm looking forward to meeting him. I've been having this pain right here. - You've met him. - How could I forget? Big, handsome, saves people's lives. Why did you get the nice glass? Because I have the *Rhône Gallagher*. Fine. What is it? There's a ship that went down in 1871, and the casks of Rhne were on it. It was a very good year. And it sank, and they washed up on shore two years ago, and they sold 180 bottles, and I have one. But not a sofa. Joan, I want you to meet someone. - My baby... Sheila. - Sheila White. - Joan is our senior secretary. - Office manager. Sheila's an assistant manager. At the Food Fair in South Orange. - She's saving for school. - Kinsey! - What? - The man upstairs is here. God? It's, uh, Mr. Hoffenburg. He wants to talk to you. He smells marijuana. Don't talk until I get back. I'm serious. I Don't think we have a Food Fair in Manhattan. - Is it a big market with a parking lot? - It is. One day you'll drive in in a station wagon and be a customer. I grew up out here. I've already been a customer. It was fun to meet the boys, put faces with names. It's good to see you and Paul together. I have to say, when Paul and I were together, the last thing I would have taken him for was open-minded. I love your purse. Thanks. I just got it. What's that? Marjorie. Works at the Newsstand. I like. But behind her. You stole that. That's from the office. That dumb girl almost got fired. But she didn't. I'm a writer. I need it. Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me. Why not? I live alone. Why should I? Because I like you, and we're having a good time, and I'm a good kisser, and you know you want to. Eugene. I'm in the persuasion business, and frankly I'm disappointed by your presentation. Oh, come on. Fifth Avenue's a parking lot, in both directions. Traffic makes the parade look bigger. What parade? Colonel Glenn. It's incredible what passes for heroism these days. I'd like ticker tape for pulling out of my driveway and going around the block three times. It's not like people were shooting at him. I think he's a winner. Square jaw, false modesty. Looks like he just took off his letterman jacket. You going to go down there with your autograph book at lunch? Can I just fire everyone? Excuse me! Excuse me! This is a place of business. Colonel Glenn will be on Earth for the rest of his life. Plane went down. American Airlines Flight 1 to Los Angeles. Crashed in Jamaica Bay. ... had suddenly become locked in a death dive into the bay... There could be a hundred people on there. Just fell out of the sky. ... turn prescribed by Idlewild Airport rules. Turn it off. Pull all Mohawk ROP. And anything in production, stop it. But it wasn't a Mohawk plane. We don't want people opening their morning paper and seeing a Mohawk ad next to a picture of a floating engine. The rest of you, stop crying and figure out how we're going to hit the ground running in three weeks with new work. Excuse me. For one thing, we should probably avoid the term "hit the ground." How about "Idlewild to Rockaway in less than eight minutes"? Answer the phone, sweetheart. Some of the passengers were on their way to a golf tournament. Apparently, the minute the plane hit, the bay turned plaid. Get back to work. Jets are made for dropping bombs on Moscow, not French cuisine. Although I like those little girls they have. You know, they're completely captive. Mr. Phillips to see you. Send him in. Someone should tell Draper to pull everything from Mohawk. He knows that. I just had an interesting conversation with Shel Keneally. He's inside of American Airlines. Is the plane still crashed? Shel was a client when I was at YR in London. We had some times together. It's complete chaos over there. - They have any idea what went wrong? - None. Normal takeoff, perfect weather. The thing just nose-dived, exploded. That's not comforting. Shel says they're going to need to make a fresh start. Did he say fresh start? A few times. That is an interesting phone call. Yes. Yes. I can't talk right now. Mr. Campbell, are you all right? Mr. Campbell? I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? What's going on? I just got off the phone with my brother. It's the strangest thing. Apparently, my father was on that plane. What? My father, he was on the... the plane. God, I'm sorry to hear that. I don't know what to do. I just saw him at the barber. Paul Molé on Lex. What does one do? Make arrangements, I guess. What am I supposed to do? What people do. Go home. I don't even think I know how old he was. Someone's going to ask that. - I Don't know. I suppose. - You know what? I don't think I'm going to tell anyone. Am I going to cry? You just had a shock. I wouldn't... worry about what you're feeling. Go home and be with your family. Why? Because that's what people do. Is that what you would do? Yes. Really? Yes. Everything's exactly the same. You should go home. What about the Stouffer's meeting? I'll cancel it. It's not hurting anything. There's life, and there's work. Hey, I got one. Mohawk Airlines: when you need to make it past Jamaica Bay. How about "American: pioneering vertical flight"? Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper would like to see you. I spoke with Hank Lamont over at Mohawk. How are they doing over there? He says they can weather it out. I always get the feeling that man opens his front door and money comes in. Always cleaned me out. Best poker player in the South Pacific. Duck, tell Don here about your phone call. Well, I put in a call to check in with Shel Keneally over at American Airlines. He used to run International. We're old pals. He picked up the phone? What's going on over there? Shel says it's bedlam. Anyway, he was quite clear about the fact that they're going to want to make changes if they want the dust to settle fast. - What does that mean? - It means they'll be looking for a new image and thus a new agency. What's it been, four, three hours since the plane went down? You'll have to forgive me for not looking at a bunch of bodies in Jamaica Bay and seeing the opportunity. Adding a few hours or a day or a week doesn't make this any more of an opportunity. - We already have an airline. - We don't have American. That's right. We have the one whose planes didn't just fall out of the sky. That's good. I'm sorry. Is there an issue? $1 million. $7 million. Am I missing something? Did you sign American during this phone call? No, but Shel made it very clear that if we can get rid of our conflict he'd love to hear our ideas. It's a serious foothold. A foothold. I'd do anything for a foothold. This is how it works. We got a regional airline so we'd have a shot at a big one. I know how you had it in your head. The president of American Airlines sees a Mohawk ad, falls in love, and says "Get me that guy." Well, I'm sorry it didn't play out that way. Easy. We have a good client who trusts us, who likes our work, who pays their bills on time. They don't deserve to be thrown out the door for a wink from American. I can't believe this. Anything else? He'll be fine. I'll need to cancel my reservations to Sarasota and, of course, Andrew's return flight. But I... - I can't possibly expect... - I'm sure that's taken care of. Dunham's taking care of all that. Bud's on the phone with him right now. I'm sure he'll forget something. There's no way that he can remember everything. Bud's very good with things like this. Is he aware there is no way to have a funeral without the remains? What's the difference? You're right. There's just so much to do. What is that? - What? - That. That. What is that? Take it. I want you to have it. He was such a fine man, so well-mannered, civic. My father admired him. What a nice thing to say. I like to offer a nice bouquet of thoughts. Did you take care of everything? They do this all the time. What? I took care of it. Give me another one of those, a big one. Dunham had some unpleasant news. Dad was insolvent, broke. Is there enough for a funeral? As if the idea of a will never crossed your mind? - We weren't going to get that. - You weren't. What about her money? The Dykeman Trust isn't as solid as one would hope. A lot of loans were taken out by the president... and recipient... Daddy. Really? For what? I asked Dunham if there was a woman. He said no. It's all oysters, travel, and club memberships. Does she know? You want to tell her? Go ahead. Everything's been taken care of. Boys. Father called you salt and pepper. That's beautiful, Dot. Hi, Daddy. I made you a ham sandwich. What is this? Carlton and Francine are coming over for cards. Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that? We haven't done it since before Christmas. And they keep inviting us, and we never go. - Can I play cards? - I want to play. I'm going to lie down for a minute. I have the chenille bedspread on. Pull it back or they'll see the marks on your face and know you were sleeping. You can say hello to everyone, then it's off to bed. Muddled. That means smash it. It'll be nicer on the second one. You did a wonderful job on mine. Thank you. Go take Mommy and Francine's orders. Bobby, that is your last one. All right, come on, go. Watch TV. They're growing like weeds. That's true. We have the Caruthers girl over to baby-sit already. Can you believe that? - I don't think we know her. - You'd remember. Goes to Immaculate Heart. I've been out of high school a long time, but, honestly, the way these girls dress, and those uniforms. - Carlton. - What? I'm enjoying this story so far, but I have a feeling it's not going to end well. I think that Francine brings her in to torture me. I mean, everything I do rubs her the wrong way. I got rid of the apartment in the city. I'm taking her to Nassau. There was a pie cooling in the windowsill, and I'm not even supposed to smell it. - It's Darkness at Noon. - What do you want to hear? Now, come on. Don't be like that. Two Tom Collins. Okay, you don't smash the cherry on that. Just plop it in at the end. Try to keep it in the top of the glass. Gin. Oil issues showed some signs of life today when the Department of the Treasury announced plans to ease import quotas on residual oil. By the end of trading today, Texaco added 1/4, Shell... Oh, good, you didn't wait. We couldn't. It's late. Work. Your hair looks nice. It does, and she fought with Mr. Pierre every minute of it. Monsieur. He's got some funny ideas. - You want something to eat? - No, thank you. I already ate. Connie Griffin was in her yard, hanging laundry in Bergen Beach. - She saw the whole thing. - Can you imagine? WLR said there were sharks eating the victims. That's worth reporting. You want toast? Mama, I already ate. You say you'll come to dinner, and you already ate? I came because I wanted to see you. We never see you. I'm here. Right now. Such a pretty face. Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church. Babe saw your brassiere ads in the newspaper. You should see poor Donny. His skin is horrible. Clearasil. - He's beyond that. - It's a shame. He's a handsome boy. Lots of people was asking me about you. Doesn't mean the same thing to me that it means to you. I think your father would like it if you lit a candle for him. I pray for you. You know she lies and tells people you're out of town on business. She has some made-up church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where you go to mass with a friend of hers. No one asked her to lie. She's not gonna be here fover. Would it kill you to go? I don't want to. And I'm capable of making my own decisions. Really? State of New York didn't think so. The doctors didn't think so. - Did you bring the vacuum? - Yes. - Did you empty the bag? - Yes. How do you let her get away with making a bid of 150? She usually overbids. How was I supposed to know? I do not overbid. I'm cautious. I hear it's gonna be a row of apartments all up Cedar Lane. No more cedars. No parking around the school. You know, I could've had that property for a song? A song and a half, tops. I thought he was crazy, but there you go. I'm sure we have something else to talk about. Did you hear about that jetliner? Terrible. It's terrible. I was supposed to fly to Cleveland. Now I can't. I have to take the train. Nine hours. You have got to be kidding. Sorry. I love the train. You do, too. Bobby. Go back to bed. I'm scared. I heard something. Everything's great. Go back to bed. Bobby. Come on. Do what your mother says. When I was a child, I would've been way more afraid of my father than of going to sleep. I hated going to sleep when I was a kid. But I bet you did when you were told. With a stack of comics and a flashlight. I don't care what they do when they're up there, I just like a few hours of quiet. Ernie tests my patience. Said they saw a ghost. They were scared. He's a little liar. He is? He drew the most amazing picture of George Washington the other day. His teacher was so impressed, - she put it up in the hallway. - It really looked like him. Well, obviously. Because he brought it home, and I noticed the exact same image of Washington on the cover of one of his books. He had traced it. What happened? He brought a book to school so he could trace it? Well, I don't know. Maybe they had it there. I mean, the point is, it was dishonest. My whole art department is run on tracing paper. Why reinvent the wheel? I've got the rest. I don't care about tracing. What about all that praise he accepted for something he didn't do? Well, the book says they start fibbing at this age. Want to see if they can make it come true. I Don't need a book to know what little boys do. You have anything you want me to take back to the library? Anything you want me to pick up? No. I have to renew The Agony and the Ecstasy. It's taking forever. I should go. I have to work tomorrow. Busy bee. Aren't you going to say good night? Hi, Aunt Peggy. Marilyn says Helen Bishop's trying to stop them from putting parking meters at Depot Plaza. Apparently, she got chummy with some administrator at the high school. Big, fat fellow. Carlton's put on a few. I think it's nice he's filled out. It shows he's happy. I wouldn't say that. Why not? Did he say something? What did he say? He didn't say anything. He should be happy. Okay, maybe he is. He should be happy and grateful, and showering Francine with love after what he put her through. Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight. I'll say whatever you think I should say, but I'm not going to fight with you. What, sweetheart? You laughed. What's funny? I just... I was just thinking that the last conversation I had with him, we were arguing about whether Barney Kellogg bred Boston terriers or French bulldogs. I'm sorry you were arguing. Those ugly little pushed-in faces. The labored breathing. He said they were French bulldogs. I said they were Boston terriers. He was angry about it. Peter, neither of you knew it was the last time. "Fighting about facts," my mother calls it. We do it all the time. Argue over something that's actually one thing or another. What do Barney's dogs look like? Just beige. Kind of like pugs, but with big ears. Those are French bulldogs. Really? When I woke up, I felt fine for a minute. Then I rembered. You should be thinking about the good times. Right. So they go out a third time, and now the restaurant's even worse... Indian food. But she really likes him. I told you he worked for City Hall, for the Mayor. - So, what happened? - I need three copies. One goes to Mr. Robinson, one to Mr. Fairbanks, and one to Mr. Smith. The strange one. - That doesn't narrow it down. - Thank you. Mr. Kinsey. Is something wrong? I'm avoiding you. Or haven't you noticed that after three days? Are you worried about the typewriter? I'm not going to tell anyone. Although you were so brazen, you don't deserve clemency. What did you say to Sheila? - Who? - Sheila. - My girlfriend. - Describe her to me. Very funny. I know what's first on the list. Oh, my God. I knew you were a lot of things... I'm not a phony. You're so proud. It's so obvious why you're seeing her. A supermarket checkout girl? Conversation must be stimulating. Lettuce costs a nickel. What a relief. You're just jealous. Because you're the one who got away? You, out there in your poor-little-rich-boy apartment in Newark or wherever. Walking around with your pipe and your beard, falling in love with that girl just to show how interesting you are. Go ahead. What part is wrong? Pete? Duck. Come in. Where's the girl? She's supposed to tell me if she goes anywhere. When my old man died, I went on a hell of a bender. You heard about that. I had to read about it in the Times. I wish you felt that you could talk to me about it. You should be able to. We're practically family here. Oh, I don't know, Duck. There's not a lot to say. No. Of course not. Your old man was in advertising, right? Boston. Used to talk about the'20s like we're idiots. My father wasn't. Of course, it turns out I really didn't know anything about him except that he did not like advertising. Ah, that's his style. I'm sure he was proud of you. Some people have trouble saying it. Yes. That was a problem for him. What's not to be proud of? You pay attention. You're hungry. Most of the time you know what you're doing. I've noticed that. I appreciate that. Now, I don't want you to think I'm being insensitive, but we're going after American Airlines. Well, it's... I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable. I'm meeting at the University Club with Shel Keneally. Tonight, actually. Get everything rolling. If anything, I'd like you on board. I want you leading the way on this thing. I think I am uncomfortable. I don't think I should do that. It just happened. I haven't even cried yet. Of course. It was inappropriate. I'm sorry for your loss. Can you come in here with the papers I asked for? Sweetheart. You mind? Need you to set a meeting. A quiet place, but public. Have a heart-to-heart with Henry Lamont. - Why would I do that? - Because we're cutting him loose. Duck's having a meeting with Shel Keneally from American Airlines tonight. He's letting them know that Mohawk is over. And that gets us a pitch? It sends a signal that we're serious. And that we're willing to do whatever it takes. He has nothing. And this is more of it. It's desperate. Come on. You should be salivating to rip these guys away from DDB. And even if we don't win this account, we're going to be on a list in the New York Times of big boys pitching for this business. We have an airline. What kind of company are we going to be? The kind where everyone has a summer house? I can't believe I look like an idiot for wanting to be loyal to these people. Take off your dress. You get a chance at American Airlines, you take it. End of discussion. Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone? Of course. Forget it. Don. Do you have a minute? What do you want, Campbell? I just was... - I don't know. - It's not a good time. If you want, you can leave him a note. People do that. No. Thank you. Good night, Joan. Did you see who did this? No. I never would have guessed you were in your 30s. People should not bring their personal problems into the office. I agree. Is it so hard to just leave everything at the door and just do your job? I look forward to it. They can't stand it. They'll drag you into the garbage out there. They just want you to be as miserable as they are. I say let them have it. How are you, Don? Henry. Sit down. Can I get you anything? You know, I'm glad you picked this place. It remds me of Pearl Harbor. For many reasons. Do you think you're not going to have to say it? Sterling Cooper has decided to end its relationship with Mohawk Airlines. Sterling Cooper. I'm sorry. It wasn't my decision. You know, when we came in there, they all said Sterling Cooper is Don Draper. That's what you get. That talk you gave me about us growing together. You said Sterling Cooper didn't need a big airline. You were going to make us a big airline. I wish things hadn't worked out this way. I'm almost embarrassed to say this. You fooled me. Stockholders weren't remotely impressed with firing our head of ops. So this agency change, well, that's going to be a process. And to be part of that process? - Listen, we're here talking, right? - Of course. But it's hard for me to leave here comfortable unless I know what your objections are. We're a few steps away from objections. We're just sticking a toe in the water. Well, we're not. We jumped in. Pete. It's good to see you. Shel, this is Pete Campbell. I don't think he's our best. I think he's the best. - Pleased to meet you. - You as well. I was just telling my buddy Shel here how we've really cleared the way to be in this. I was telling Duck here we don't know where we are yet. I Don't think you're aware of the level of commitment and enthusiasm for this project at Sterling Cooper. It's true. We've got writers bucking the gate. I've already got a stack of ideas on my desk that I think you'd love to see. We understand how delicate the process of rebuilding the public's confidence will be. Not just the public. Our stockholders. Well, I want you to know that, should miners died. Somebody broke the ice intentionally. Who? I couldn't see his face. I'm telling the truth! Oh boy. These two say that the book isn't theirs. You claim that somebody broke the ice. What the hell is going on? The special guard of the ice house. What are you doing in a filthy place like this? I'm just saying hello. Duk-moo. Father. Why did she wanted him to escape? Today we had Seyit Durak's hearing..obviously they thought they would not get another chance.. Do you suspect something else? I don't know Adnan.. I don't know Feride manages to suprise me again... Why did she want to support the man who attempted to murder her father? All I know is that we have to get a hold of that evidence immediately Of Course OK then. Don't waste any time.. go and help Selim I want you to come back with good news... I want this matter to be over soon. Of course sir BTW Adnan, If Feride really helped that thug, then I want her to be punished for her deed... Whatever the punishment may be... I understand sir There's everything in the kitchen.. tea.. soup.. whatever you want.. I must get going now. Are you going to the neighborhood? Of course.. I can't let the place be vacant Be careful Orhan.. You have to have two eyes behind your head from now on I don't like that this Turgut has been wandering around claiming that he's the new kabadayi now. Be super cautious. Don't you worry brother.. don't preoccupy your mind all the guys are well trained. we will look around with 4 eyes. he can't dare do anything. I'm off. Komsir Well Mahir. It's been a long time since we two had a chance to talk to each other I guess we still can't. This is the call you've been waiting for. Hello Mahir? It's me I found the address Tell me right away, I'll write it down NO, I won't give you the address Why? Because if I give you the address you will not take me there, I know. I know you very well, Mahir Kara And you know me. You know how stubborn I can be Feride, is it time for stubborness? If you want the address, be at the post office that is near Minet Ortakoy after half an hour, and I will be there right away Don't Feride! This isn't a game! I cannot throw you into danger! You have a half hour, Mahir What did he say, Feride? What can he say? He got angry But I was right. He was going to take the address and not take me. Now he's forced to He's just trying to protect you. Understand how much he loves you and cares for you Let's go, Suna, enough talking. Let's get out of here, this place is too confined. I feel bad as it is Okay, lets get out Will you always be like this with Mahir? You won't tell him at all that you're pregnant? Never! He will never know! Why? Because there's no future for Mahir and I... I will give birth to my child and raise him alone Even if he knew it doesn't change anything. Mahir will go back to prison after we find the evidence And if he doesn't go, they will arrest him This is not possible! What do you expect me to do, Suna? You should tell him taht he has a child. This is his right! Will that make everything better? Will he not burn with longing for his child? Will he not be sad? Will he not be devastated? Feride! I thought you didn't want to tell Mahir because you were angry with him I can't be angry with him... I can't give up on him.. I am only his, Suna. And I will be only his forever When they'll arrest my dad, I will leave from here anyways I thought a lot about it. This is best for both of us Tamam, I'll shut up Anyways, I will drive you to the house on my way -Hello all -Should I bring you a cup of tea abi I've had my tea already, Ne...are there any news? No abi, .. everything's fine.. the guys are on duty That's good There's only one thing What is it? -That lowlife Seyis... -And? We had our guys follow him We heard he went to Yusuf's office to meet Turgut I knew that this dishonorable man was doing things behind our backs.. it was obvious that he would sell us in a blink of an eye Let's go, Osman and tell Dalyan abi. Tahsin, I'll entrust this place to you Just drop me off here and I'll take the taxi Where are you going? Home? No.. it's better for me not to be home tonight.. I'm sure Adnan is looking for me everywhere.. he probably wants to interrogate me.. I'm sure he's figured it out by now. What do we do Feride? Don't lose your calmness. just be at work on time and leave the rest to me.. OK be careful I know.. where are you staying tonight? I have a relative.. I'll stay with them.. I'm so sorry Suna to have you involved in this as well Stop the nonsense Feride,.. Just drop me off by the taxi there Who are you? -Who are you! ? -Shut up Help ,... -Take her -Let me go Is she ok? She's ok..she just resisted a bit OK then follow us Shhhh... the guard is on duty you stay here Feride, Don't. Don't be stubburn and just give me the address Let me go and take care of this in my own way NO way, Mahir. Either we go together, or I'll find another way Feride, don't make me go crazy! Go crazy if you want, Mahir I went crazy a long time ago. Besides, you cannot have everything under your control all the time My father is the cause of all this.. NO offense, but it will happen as I want it! Tamam If this is how it will be, then come on, Let's go You can be a little more gentle, can't you? Hisbinallah! Allahim! If you give me the address we can know where we're going Go in the direction of Ferikoy -To which area in Ferikoy? -You just go, and I will tell you What does this mean now? You don't trust me? Yes, I don't trust you Because you can pull over to the side of the road at anytime and drop me off But I will not allow that And please do not stop so abruptly, I don't like it! Alright, Hakime Hanim, as you desire! I'm going to take out the trash That's good. I see that you've adapted to your job ver well. Yes but it's not permanent yet. He asked me to work for a few days to test me out first OK don't worry. I must get going now. He's not asleep yet. he might suspect why a simple trash disposal is taking so long. tamam.. hurry and go Very well.. this is for child support.. this is for the salaries.. and this is for the bribery come on in -Good evening, abi -Good evening I need to talk to you You take care of the rest.. what happened? It turned out as I had thought.. this dog, Seyis has sold us out He met Turgut today... they're doing things behind our backs I don't like this at all.. apparently he's playing a double game now well, we also know how to play this game as well Don't worry... we'll be informed soon The sooner we find this bank, the better.. We shouldn't upet Mr. Minister.. we both know very well what he's capable of doing.. Come in I found out sir.. Vedat has rented a box in the "Istiklal" bank, at the Tamiz branch.. OK you may go.. let me give this good news to Mr. Minister Here, Mahir The third floor. The lights are totally off, hopefully they're at home He probably went to sleep. He wakes up early in the morning to go to work You stay here, I will get the director and come Then we will all go together to the bank. We will convince him somehow and make him open the safe box I told you to wait in the car, Feride And I told you that this matter will happen as I want, Mahir. We will take every step togther Hadi, Mahir! you're not gonna use your gun, right? You're just going to flash it and scare him right? God forbid It's enough that you show it to him. That will scare him off. Here you go Hakime hanim I think it's better to keep the police out of this, Selim What for? If any of them opens his mouth it will cost you a lot. Let's handle this a little differently this time You're right. But how else can we do this? I have my own thugs. I'll ask them to steal it from there.. simple as that. That will be great... all I care about is to get the evidence. That's all We can't enter the house like this Mahir What else can we do Feride? I don't know.. let's ring the bell and try to explain to him how sensitive this matter is. We might manage to convince him... is that the reason you asked me to escape... was it to talk to him and convince him? - yes, you're right, but... -I know you're scared.. but I promised you that nothing will happen.. once we open the safe and get the evidence I will personally escort him back to his home, OK? Was I snoring again? I will remove my hand now.. but if you scream it will be bad for you if you want everything to be all right, just do as I tell you tamam.. Hakime hanim. What do you want from me? Have you lost your mind? Just wear this. We are heading to the bank It's for the safe, isn't it? Stop talking,. Just wear your clothes.. Hurry I'll wait outside That's perfect.. I just don't want any problems.. Yes. they'll rob the bank momentarily.. I dispatched the entire unit from that neighborhood so there won't be any issues This is crazy.. if my wife finds out I'm not there she will call the police.. We won't take long Mr. Director I know it is really hard for you to understand but the evidence inside the box is extremely important to us. I am forced to do this in order to achieve justice Please don't do this.. you're a grand judge What kind of justice is this? You want to accomplish justice by kidnapping an innocent man from his bedroom and stealing a deceased person's belonging? I have serious questions about your justice.. Forget about the questions.. just give us what we want my friend and then we'll take you back home Hello Kemal, is there any news about Mahir? NO.. nothing about Mahir... they're still looking for him They've dispatched the entire unit to vacate a neighborhood around this particular bank Come pick me up immediately Kemal We wanna go to Seyis's farm tomorrow dad. I don't understand, Son He has to understand what it means to betray us we will interrogate him. Dad, I want your permission in order to take my sister out of there Open the door.. police They came after my brother Hurry I'm coming too We are going to enter the bank quietly.. you will open the safe and give us the evidence and then i'll return you home Aren't the safes there? Yes, but the key is inside my office Don't you dare.. I told you I won't harm you. Don't force me then so just open the safe and let us be done with it OK OK, the keys Hurry It's here I can't believe he killed my mom with this.. this was his birthday gift from me Are you OK? i won't be OK until he's arrested and pay for his crimes, Let's go I hear something Who are they? They probably found out that the evidence is here.. -is there a back door here? -there is Just grab this and go Feride I will never leave you alone here We have no time to argue.. just get it and go the most important thing is to hand over this evidence to a trustworthy source you go with her too I won't go Mahir.. If you don't come with me, I won't leave I will distract them so you and the director can exit from the back door... I will follow you right after What if something happens? Hurry Feride.. I'll meet you at Orhan's place Hurry, Go... If you hesitate, you will endanger the evidence, go... He's right.. we should leave here immediately.. -come this way -But I can't For the sake of the evidence Feride hanim.. let's go I guess he's out of bullets.. Let's go get him Don't move.. Don't move.. Stop you should've been in your bed now.. now you won't see the sunshine in the morning.. what a pity Police.. hold your hands up... are you OK? Mahir... Where's the evidence? Let me see it I don't have it with me.. Feride has it It's a letter opener and probably her father's fingerprints are on it Let's go abi... the police and ambulance will arrive at any second now OK, Let's go Look, uncle.. we will eventually find him no matter whether you tell us or not where he is but if you helped us, nobody will get hurt I'll open it.. Feride.. What happened? Come on in I have to find Yasin immediately dad.. Orhan gave me a number to call Feride Orhan.. a bunch of guys walked into the bank... Mahir got stuck there I have to find Yasin immediately OK got it.. Don't worry Feride.. My brother is OK...he's hiding Oh thank God... Please take me to him I have to safeguard this evidence till morning -be careful son -don't worry dad. What do you mean there's no evidence? How is that possible? What is this incapability? Unfortunately our guys were arrested by a police officer... it was totally an accident cause I had dispatched all the units to vacate the area.. the robbery was planned while this police officer arrived and arrest them Where's the evidence now? I couldn't quite understand it.. but apparently they had a clash with a guy that matched the description of Mahir Kara. it's obvious that he's got the evidence... Find both Mahir and the evidence and bring them to me Yes sir. Feride's not around either.. it's obvious that they're in this together find them both.. and bring the evidence to me You are a servant loved by God, abi. The bullet just grazed you. Forgive me. Did I hurt you? Bandage it, Yasin. Bandage it fast, I need to find Feride. Why abi? you talked and agreed to meet here.. Where will you find her? The evidence is with Feride. Those men are after the evidence. I need to find Feride before they get to her Who is it? It's us. There's no problem Mahir! What happened to you? I mean, what happened to your arm? You were wounded? Did you examine it with a doctor? Don't worry Feride, I am fine.. There is nothing to worry about Feride, the evidence is with you? Yes, it is with me Tama, since everything is ok, we will go. Right, Orhan? Abi, I don't have to tell you, but they are looking for you everywhere See you You can go abi.. but I'll stay here.. I just wanted to give them some privacy otherwise I would've stayed too.. you may go. I won't disturb them. Let me help. NO, thanks, I got it Get well soon What will you do now? I don't know. My mind is very confused But he must not find out that I have the evidence It's like you are around with a ticking time bomb, Feride Like that exactly, actually The only thing that will destroy my father is that letter opener That is why he is looking for it everywhere. He is using all his resources. And he will destroy it the moment he finds it The whole state is at his command He is immune, and if I don't act carefully he will escape form this matter somehow and with the appropriate spin on things yet again That's why everything has to be very secretive Alright, who will you give the evidence to? More correctly, who among the ones you know do you trust? The bassavci He is one of the most honorable people I've known in this life But he will first ask me to prove that the fingerprints on this murder weapon are my fathers And how will you do that? Please don't stand this close to me If I take three steps back, will I be far enough? I need to rest, Mahir But I can't go home with this evidence in my hands.. He will probably question where I have been at this hour He might suspect If there's no problem for you, I mean if you allow me, can I sleep somewhere here? I will lay down in any place How many hours until the morning anyways? I'll sleep here Let me cover you with this I'll do it, thanks You didn't go? I didn't go, Abi. I wasn't reassured enough to go Why did you come out? It is forbidden for me to touch her and love her There is, Orhan... It can be forbidden, so he has to put a barrier in his heart Why, Abi? If I am beside her today, then I cannot be tomorrow... And the reality is that I want to spend my life holding her But I cannot give her any promises and I cannot ask her for any promises Our story ends here That is why the sooner she forgets me, the better. You're awake? I... came to check on you... I'll go wash my hands and my face Good morning Abi. Is Orhan in? He's not, What's up I went to visit sister Zehra.. Orhan asked me to visit her every now and then But no matter how long I've knocked on the door, she won't open. Did you ask the neighbors? I did, they said some guys came to the neigborhood and took her with them by force What are you saying -Good Morning brother. -Good morning abi where to abi? First, we're going to drop Feride off at the courthosue, then I'll go back to prison What happened dad? Where have you been daughter? It must be very important matter that made you all gather around me You're the one that has some explaining to do according to prosecutor Adnan, You've helped Mahir to escape What kind of proof does the prosecutor have for this accusation? I'm really curious to know OK then.. now that I've been accused of such a serious matter, I have to sit and talk to the head prosecutor Yes, .. apparently so dad would you like to accompany us? Apparently you also have no doubt that I'm behind this I wouldn've preffered not to have any doubt Thanks to you, I won't be worried in there Say hi to dad and Songul. Watch out for Ilknur Don't you worry brother.. let me know if you had any problems My strong man.. what happened yasin? What's going on? This pig-faced prosecutor has set a trap for Feride with the help of her father, he kept interrogating a lot of people he's compiled a big file regarding your escape. and he's accusing Feride of helping you I will... Anyways I came to inform you about it.. I barely managed to sneak out of the courthouse Feride has the evidence ant that pig-face prosecutor and her father are by her side if they find the evidence, they'll destroy everyone.. we have to go to the courthouse and somehow stop them 901: 01:57:51,800 -- 01:57:52,700 Come on in Mr. Head prosecutor Welcome Mr. Minister and Hakime hanim We have to take a few minutes of your time Mr. Prosecutor What are you saying? What's the problem? Prosecutor Adnan has made an accusation of me and my father as a minister is worried about it that's the reason why he's also joined us here Really Yes.. Prosecutor Adnan would like to share his concerns with you and I'd like my father also to stay here with us -Please bring tea for all of us -Yes Sir Well, I'm listening to you Adnan bey Brother, Feride is in the courthouse right now There are a lot of police officers and also her colleagues around her I don't think they can do anything to her there If they dare try to do something to her, then only God can help them I won't let that prosecutor and her dad live. Push the gas pedal Orhan These are the testimonies of the soldiers... you may review all of them it's obvious that Feride hanim has assisted Mahir to escape What do you have to say about this Feride hanim? The statements are correct.. I wanted to meet Mahir Kara But not to help him escape. He attempted to murder my father I just wanted to talk to him face to face I wanted to scream to him and tell him how much he's made me suffer but I guess I've cause this mess instead. I know I made a big mistake therefore I am now asking you to accept my resignation Are you sure about that? That's a major decision you're about to make Yes sir.. I'm sure... They'll take me for interrogation, Everyone will be suspicious of me Everyone will believe that I've helped a prisoner escape I can't bear such a thing after going through so much suffering. with your permission father.. Mr Minister, Mr prosecutor, if you allow me I would like to have a few words with Hakime hanim because this is such a sensitive subject, we need to speak in private Look, you see his fingerprints Yes.. you're right.. you can see it clearly it's funny how we were trying to figure out how to get his fingerprints for the last half hour or so and then he walked in to the trap with his own feet.. You finally succeeded Hakim hanim Yes.. it was very hard, but I succeeded Yes.. and you've paid a big price for it. Yes.. maybe I helped Mahir escape unintentionally Mr. Prosecutor. But for me, what's more important than my profession is to accomplice justice therefore I'm hereby requesting you to do everything you possibly can to prosecute my father Thank you to all the translators providing translation for eps 108 - Are you going to say hi? - Maybe tomorrow after my final. Right now I've got to become an expert on marginal productivity theory. I'd ask you what that is, but then I'm afraid you'd tell me. You need anything? I got ups, downs, sideways. That's very supportive. What's a few meds between sisters? Huh? You were in the park today, weren't you? You promised you wouldn't. - You know what? I'm sorry. I just... I try. Every day How would you feel if I came home drunk? I'd hate it. That's right. You'd lose your shit. So don't tell me not to be mad. I got it! Hey. Billy's cousin gets in tomorrow and we need to know about dinner Sunday night. Oh, right. Hold on. Instead of waiting to get better before you meet a guy, why don't you meet a guy and see if that helps you get better? Please. It's one stupid dinner, and he's really cute. I promise. And he's smart. You'll like him. I know it. We'll let you know in the morning, okay? - I got to move your car. It's blocking mine. - Here. Drive mine. Thanks. Don't work too hard. Ah! There you go, sweetie. Hey. Hey! Relax. Relax. Settle down. - Okay, I'll do it. - - Do what? I'll go to dinner with you guys. - Yay! Thank you. - What's the worst that can happen, right? - You have fun. Ew! - Are you going to bed? - Yeah. I'll finish studying in the morning. Wake me up when you get home, okay? - Okay. It'll be 6:30. - That's perfect. Ooh, and bring me back something sweet so we can get fat together after my test. Okay, it's a deal. - Hey, my other line. It's Billy. - All right, sweet dreams. Love you. - She said yes to Sunday. - Oh, that's great. And the next sound you will hear is me brushing my teeth. Pretty please. No way. If I come over now, we won't get to bed for hours, and I still have a ton of reading to do. Fine. Fine. I'll just have to hug my pillow. You leave that poor thing alone. Or I could drive over there right now. - In and out, 10 minutes - Oh. That's very considerate. Good night, Billy. Here's the damage. Thanks. Sir, do you want anything else? Just the check. - Here you go. - Great. Three grilled cheese. - Hey, did you go to Prospect? - Yeah, when you were in sixth grade. Really? You don't look that old. Dude, give it up. You got no chance. Plus, hello? I'm right here. I know I've seen you before. Are you famous or something? Yeah. That's why I work here, to keep myself humble. It's your lucky day. Look what I got on a cup of coffee. - Look what he gave me for nothing. But that's not your station. He usually is. He's a regular and he's moving away. See what happens when you're nice to people? Good things happen. Okay, I'll see you Monday. - Hold on. I'm going to walk you to your car. - I'm right outside. What, you don't believe me? Sleep sweet. Good night. Rise and shine! Time to get up. Molly? Do you hear that sound? It's me not laughing. Come on, Molly! Hey, it's Molly. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this. Immediately, no matter what. Okay, bye. Hi. I'm too cool to come to the phone right now. Billy, it's Jill. I just need you to call me when you wake up. Thanks. Bye. Sergeant Powers. Jill. Hi. I'm a little busy right now. - It's urgent. - Okay. - Right here? - Why not? Uh, he's back. He came back for me. He broke into my house, took my sister because I wasn't there. That's my sister, Molly. Um... Well, I moved into the house about six months ago, and about a month ago, Molly called me, saying that it was too expensive for her to live alone and asked if she could live in my house. But I don't think he ever knew that she lived there. Miss Conway, what makes you think your sister's been abducted? Because I spoke to her last night on the phone at 11:00. She was going to bed. And I don't think that she would just run off in the middle of the night without leaving a note. Especially after what happened to me. She had a final exam today that was really important. She was studying. She left all her books just laying out, and she was wearing a pajama shirt and boxer shorts, and they weren't at the house when I looked for them. I know she's still wearing them. Nobody's writing anything down. - Anything else? - I found her earring on the floor. It's a little diamond post stud from my parents that they gave her for her graduation, and I know she was wearing them when I left. He's back. This guy is back. I know he's back. Jill, calm down, okay? Please have a seat. Was there any sign of forced entry? No. There wasn't any the first time, either. No one could figure out how he got in. What about Molly's car? I drove her car to work, and I left my car in the driveway. That's why I think he assumed that I was home alone. And Molly's cell phone? It's... She keeps it in her purse. She uses the landline when she's home. - Where's her purse? - It's gone. When you were abducted, was your purse taken? - No. - Is there anything else missing? No. Yes! An old photo of her taken from her yearbook. When you were abducted, did he take one of your photographs? No! No. Does Molly have a boyfriend? Yeah. I called him. He's sleeping. He... Molly could be with him right now. No, not on the night before a test. She had a lot of studying to do. - So, it is possible? - No. No. The answer's no. Jill, there are a million other girls that this guy could victimize. Why would he come back for you? Because I'm the only one that got away, because I know his secret. I know what he's doing in Forest Park. He could have taken any one of these girls. They're all missing. If you hear from Molly, give us a call immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you back here on Monday morning. Monday? It's Friday! It's Friday. Last week, a college honors student disappeared into thin air. Her family said she must have been kidnapped because she's a very responsible girl and would never, ever run off without telling anyone. It turns out "thin air" was a motel room in Walla Walla, Washington. She met a boy at a party and decided to be impulsive for once. Miss Conway, adults have the right to disappear. When he came down to kill me, it was the end of the day. He said to me, "it's time." That's what he said to me. "It's time." He's going to kill Molly tonight. Please. She's the only family that I have. - Come on. - You heard what the lieutenant said. - No! Jill, please stop it. You've been up all night. It's all in your head. Please go home and get some sleep. Jill. I'm new to this unit, but I'm going to pull your file right now. I'm Detective Hood. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call. Here, give me your number. Punch it in. She's committed to her story. Hey! If my sister dies, it's your fault! I bet that's Molly right now. - Hey, is Molly with you? - No. Why? I came home last night and she wasn't there and she didn't leave a note. Oh, shit. You don't think she slipped, do you? Do you think she's drinking? Uh, no. I'm at the police station, so I'll call you back. She's not with her boyfriend. That's because she might have two of them. Did you ever think of that? Look, Jill, why don't you just go home? Get some sleep? I'll sleep when he's dead. She's not going to go looking for him, is she? Don't worry. She won't find him. He doesn't exist. This time last year, a few days after Easter, a hiker spots Jill at the north end of Forest Park. She's covered in mud, about half froze to death, screaming about how some guy broke into her house, snatched her out of bed, threw her down a hole out in the woods someplace. Homicide was called in because she said she wasn't the only one, that there were human remains down there. So, of course, we throw everything at it, search teams, dogs, aerial units, the whole nine. And guess what? Nothing. No hole, no scene at all at the house. Tests come back on Jill. No defensive wounds. No sign of sexual contact, no foreign DNA of any kind. And she can't ID the guy at all. I mean, all day in a hole, she never once saw the guy's face? And then she's got this mental history. A couple of years back, she lost both of her parents within a few months of each other. She ends up in a psych ward on a suicide watch. Understandably. We start poking holes in her story, and she flips out. We had to ship her off to St. Joseph's on an involuntary commit. They held her for a couple of months. - Oh, man. - Yeah. But she stuck with her story. And now every time a girl goes missing, she thinks it's her guy and she's in here breaking my balls. She could always move in with me. I like them a little crazy. You want to work with me, Hood? Get your mind right. If you want to chase split-tail, then go be a firefighter. You feel me? Yes, sir. All right. - Hi. - Any word from Molly yet? - No. I would have... - I checked her gym. She hasn't been there. So now I'm thinking one of her friends from econ class dragged her off to a study group. - In her pajama top and boxer shorts? - Maybe she took a change of clothes. - But all of her books are here. - And you're sure this is all of them? Well, no, but... If I can find a class list, I can call some of the other students. Uh, I would check her desk. Right. Man, she's organized. I told the cops that she'd never leave without telling me, but they didn't really care. Here we go. - What time's her final? - Noon. Okay. Well, if I don't find her, I'll go to the exam, see if she shows up. Okay. And you're positive she didn't go out drinking, right? Yeah. Aren't you? What's that? You said she was still wearing them. - Different ones. - But those are the only pair she has. No, she has another pair that's off-white with blue stripes and the same flowers. - What? - I've only seen just those. But I know what she was wearing, Billy. - They have blue stripes on them, Billy. Mrs. Cermak, I was wondering if you could help me with something. You haven't said one word to me since the day you moved in, and now you want my help? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be unfriendly. I just... I'm a pretty private person. What is it, dear? What's the matter? My sister, Molly, she disappeared while I was at work last night, and I just... I was just wondering if you had heard something. It was after 11:00, maybe. Oh, good Lord. I'm sound asleep by 10:00. So is Herb. We're dead to the world at that hour. Okay. Have you called the police? Yeah. They don't care. Well, you know who I would talk to? I would talk to Conrad Reynolds over there. He's up all night. He hasn't slept a wink since his wife died, and that was 12 years ago now. Okay. But be careful. He's real squirrelly. - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. What do you want? Hi, Mr. Reynolds. My name is Jill Conway. I live across the street and... Someone stole my bike from my backyard when I was sleeping, and I was just wondering if you happened to see or hear anything unusual last night. I mind my own business. You ought to do the same. Wait. I mind my own business, too, but if there's a prowler around and if he's brazen enough just to steal my bike off my back porch, I mean, what's next? Think hard. Please, Conrad. Did you see a stranger walking by or a car that you didn't recognize? Nothing? All right. Thanks anyway, though. There was a noise. Some asshole honked his horn twice, real loud. - In the middle of the night? - It was after around 1:00. I know because I was watching my Scrubs. Did they just drive by? No, they were parked in front of that yellow house there. That's my house. Were they in my driveway? Yeah. Sat there for a little while and drove off. - Did you see the driver? - Too dark. But the van was blue and gray. A locksmith or plumber, I think. It said "all hours" on the sign. I don't know why the hell a plumber would want to steal a bike. Yeah, neither do I. Thanks a lot. If you talk to him, you tell him I didn't appreciate that honking one goddamn bit. I'm all alone here since my wife died. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. It must be really hard to sleep alone. Impossible. Thanks. - Do I know you? You almost got us killed. - Sorry. - What the hell are you chasing me for? I wasn't. I was coming here. I just got stuck in the wrong lane. Come on. The boss is inside. Customer! Back already? Grabbed the wrong Kwikset. She wanted the 665. Henry Massey. What can I do for you? I need some information, actually. All right. Did you have a job last night on Hardy, off Parkway, at around 2:30? No. Are you sure? Can you check? Don't have to. My son works 6:00 to midnight. If a call comes in after that, I get paged at home and take it myself. Last night was quiet. You sure don't look like a cop. Why don't you head across the street when you're done? I'll meet you there for lunch. Sounds good. - So what's this all about? - No, thanks. It's sort of a long shot, but... Um... At 2:30 this morning, a car horn woke up my grandmother, and she looked out the window and she saw her Cadillac facing one of your vans in the street. Now, her car had been stolen, and the guy that was trying to make a getaway was blocked by your van. And they crawled past each other, and I just thought maybe your driver got a good look at the guy. - Said it was one of our vans? - Yeah, definitely. Nick, wake up! I need to talk to you. - Have I ever been out to your place before? - Nope. - Hmm. Say hello to our visitor. Hi. I'm going to ask you a simple question, Son. Lie to me, and I'm gonna ship you back to your mother, you understand? Yeah. Did you drive the van last night? No. Like I said. One of your vans was on my block last night, and it's really important that you tell me how it got there because a crime was committed. What kind of crime? What the hell does that matter if you didn't drive it? - Well, I'm just curious. Damn. - Never mind about that. It seems your grandma was mistaken. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Stay back! Jesus! You crazy bitch. What did I do to you? "Bitch"? Is that what you called my sister when you pulled her out of her bed? - What? What are you talking about? - This receipt! At 7:04 last night! You started work at 6:00! You couldn't have been driving that, but you were driving, because you lied! Okay, calm down. Somebody else was driving the van. This guy came in. He needed to move some tools, all right? He gave me a couple hundred bucks to use the van for a few hours. By the time I got back from the club, this van was right here, all right? With the key on the tire. - What was his name? - Digger. Oh, what, is that a first name? I don't know. His name was Digger. That's what he said. - What did he look like? - He was tall. He wore a hat. That's it? You don't know where he lives? - He was there for five minutes. - Think! Nick, where the hell did you go? Hey! - Hey, stop! Jesus! Yeah, you better get your ass out of here! Man, Sarge has a short fuse. I told a stupid joke, he practically ripped my head off. No, he's not bad. It's just that you got soft. How long were you on disability? - You homicide? - Yeah. And it's his third day, so be gentle. What's up? Jill Conway just broke into a locksmith's van over in Oakdale. When the locksmith's kid busted her, she pulled out a .38. Shit. You know what? I have a better idea. Why don't you listen to me, okay? Because I'm the only one that's actually trying to save my sister's life. All right, what's on the receipt? Hurry up. Okay. Three rolls of duct tape, plastic sheeting, 50 feet of rope, kerosene, and a lantern, all bought yesterday by the same guy whose van was outside of my house this morning. The locksmith's son said he rented the van to a guy named Digger. "Digger"? You get it? I sure do. Hold on a second. Jill, are you carrying a gun? Hmm? Listen to me very carefully. You were involuntarily committed to a mental health facility. That means no firearms. So you get down here with that gun right now, or it's going to get real bad for you real fast. Okay? Jill? Jill, I do not have time for this. - Shit! - What do you want? - It's Hood. We're off speaker now. Listen, I took a look at your file, and I think you're right. I think the same guy who grabbed you grabbed Molly. I talked to my boss, to Lieutenant Bozeman. - And? - I laid my ass on the line for you, all right? I convinced him. He gave me the case. I'm the lead investigator. I'm going to find Molly. We'll do this together. Hello? Are you there? - Yeah. - Tell me where you are. I'll come right over, we'll get that gun squared away, and I'll take a look at that receipt. We'll pay the hardware store a little visit, okay? Maybe even take a look around Forest Park. - No, we won't. You'll lock me up. - What? No. I want to help you, Jill. You have to trust me. You can't do this alone. Just watch me. We got a 12-34 out there waving a gun. You know what that means? If she drops someone, it's on us for wrongful death. Bring her in. Jill deactivated the GPS on her iPhone. Have Marvin call up her tag, then put out a BOLO. - Check the cell tower on that last call. - Okay. She married you anyway? What's wrong with her? Well, because I didn't tell her about it. Oh! Okay. Portland Dispatch to cars, stand by for Attempt to Locate. I mean, what was I going to say to her? "Baby, I banged your sister five years ago, but if I'd known I was going to marry you someday, I wouldn't have done it." Attempt to locate Oregon license 216 David Charlie Boy. A blue 1988 Saab registered to Jillian Tyler Conway. 5'4", blue and blond, should be considered armed and dangerous. - So her sister kept quiet? - Yeah, to the grave. 'Cause she knows if she breathes a word, I won't do her again. No, she's not at her exam. But you know what's weird? Neither is Trey Burgess. Who is that? They did a project together at the beginning of the quarter. He was always hitting on her, trying to get her to smoke weed. The TA gave me his address. He lives in a dorm. - Willard Hall. - I used to live there freshman year. I'm five minutes away. What dorm number? - You sure? - Yes, give it to me. 713. What about you? You find out anything? Maybe. I'll call you back. Hi there. What can I do you for? This is going to sound kind of strange, but my grandfather disappeared last night, and I was hoping you could help me find him. He's got pretty advanced Alzheimer's. Here's how I see it. The first time a man hits his wife, she's a victim. The second time, she's an accomplice. Harsh. Hey. Isn't that our BOLO? The Saab? 216 DCB. Sure is. - 641, Dispatch. - - Go ahead, 641. We have our suspect vehicle. His next-door neighbor said he saw him leave about 3:00 with a friend, but I have no idea which friend he left with. But I did find this receipt from here. It looks like they were here about 7:04. Do you have a surveillance camera? Oh, no. We're not Home Depot. Were you working yesterday at 7:04? I'm always working, dear. I own the place. Maybe you remember my grandfather and his friend? - Hmm. - 'Cause that was... Sir, if you wouldn't mind, checkout is right at the front. - Thank you. I will. - You come back and see us, now. - Do you have a visual? - Negative. Can't tell if it's occupied. Non-emergency off the air until cover arrives. Standing by for cover. Start us more units. - It was a pretty big sale. - Oh, yeah, I remember this. Only it wasn't two guys. It was only one guy. He wasn't your grandfather. He was only about 40. Oh! I know who it is. I think it's the guy my grandfather used to go fishing with. - His name is Digger. His nickname's Digger. - Mmm-hmm. I don't know his real name, though. Did he use a credit card, by any chance? - Nope. He paid with cash. - Do you remember anything else about him? - Well... I know that he drove a 1990 Chrysler Imperial with 176,000 miles on it. I only know that 'cause he told me. Pretty proud of that crate. No idea why, but he parked it right up front. - What color was it? - It was kind of a burgundy. Can I give you my phone number in case you remember anything else? You know what? I know where he lives. How's that? He told me that the powers that be at the Royal Hotel evicted him because his car took up two parking spots. - They can evict you for that? - I figured he was pulling my leg about that. I don't know. I've never heard of that. Royal Hotel? - It's up on Halsted, I think. - Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I hope you find him. Uh... Female emergency. Do you have a restroom? Sure, yeah. Right this way. It's in the back. There you go. Officers, what's going on? We're looking for the owner of a vehicle parked outside. It's a young woman, blonde hair, blue eyes. I don't know if it's who you're looking for, but there's somebody like that in the restroom. - Where is it? - She'll be right back out. Show me. Can you please hurry it up in there? Hello? We have shots fired! One from inside the bathroom! Police! Open the door now! On the floor, on the floor! She's gone. She bailed. She went out the south side of the building. - Hey, can I bum a cigarette? - We don't smoke. Sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't, either. My mom died from lung cancer when she was 47. It was the worst, most tragic thing ever. How do you guys like this neighborhood? I'm thinking about moving in. It's okay. Our school's two blocks that way. We eat lunch at home. How lame is that? There's hardly anything to do here, you know? The nearest mall is really far. Yeah, I hate that. Anyway, bye Hey. I know something that would be totally fun. How would you like to see Justin Bieber at the Rose Garden? Are you serious? He was just here. I didn't think he was coming back. Oh, yeah. My brother's his tour manager. I've had dinner with him three times. I can get you backstage passes. - Oh, my God! - You're not serious. So what's Justin like? Where's bad cop, huh? Is he typing up my arrest warrant? Jill, it's Hood. Listen to me. You know what? If you don't want to do your job, that's fine. - Listen. - But you got to stay out of my way. My mom. - I thought she died of lung cancer. - It's a long story. - What? Leave me alone. - Trey, it's important! Open up. I'm not leaving. - What do you want? - You missed your econ final. Yeah, I had a gig last night. I overslept. Who the hell are you? - I'm Molly Conway's sister. - Who? Oh. - Yeah, she missed it, too. - So? - Was she at your gig last night? She hates me. She thinks I'm a drug addict. Why would she be at my gig? - I want to come in. - She's not here, all right? Hey! What the... Molly? Molly! Crazy bitch. Okay, let's call it. Units can go mobile. - We lost her. She's in the wind. - Maybe not. Hang on. Her last call just pinged off the Tyler Street tower. That's inside the perimeter. She could be just laying low. Who needs this shit? Call the cab companies, call the car rentals. Get her ass in here! Shit. Excuse me. Hey. - Do you live around here? - Yeah. I was hanging out with a friend the other day, and this guy came and clipped my car and just drove away. Her little brother looked out the window and said he saw this crate. - A dark red Chrysler Imperial. - Yeah. That's Jim Lapointe. - Who is that? - He lives right below us. 2A. Awesome! Thank you. He's okay, right? He's not going to shoot me in the head if I knock on his door and ask for his insurance, right? He might. He's pretty weird. My girlfriend says he's got "rapey eyes," so I don't know. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. Hello? Help! Help! Help! Someone, help me! - Can I get you anything else? - Just the check. - Hey! - Hey! Hey! I'm the janitor! What did you do that for? I thought you were someone else. You have no right to put your hands on me. Well, you have no right to be snooping around on private property! - You're right. Sorry. Are you okay? No, I'm not. So, this guy, Mr. Lapointe, did he leave a forwarding address? Nope. He moved up north. - Where? - Man, you really messed up my wrist. Did he say where? He just said he was going to tie up some loose ends and head north. What, does he owe you money or something? No. He used to do lawn work for my aunt and she died. She left him $20,000 in her will. - Oh! That's some lawn work. - Yeah. She was crazy. And mean. She was really mean. She didn't give me a cent, actually. I did everything for her. Of all the days for my car to break down. - Do you want to make some money? - Always. - Do you have a car? - Barely. It's a hunk of junk. I always figured if I met a girl as pretty as you, money would change hands. I just thought it would be in the other direction. I must be crazy. - This time tomorrow, right? - Yep. Key under the right rear. - You swear? - Yeah. - What if you don't show? - It means I'm dead. - I can't believe they involved you in this. - Jill, it's my job. If I needed you, I would have called you. You know that. Yeah, under normal circumstances, of course you would. Just tell me what's happened. We always talked about him coming back like it would never happen, like it was just me being paranoid. But we were wrong and he did come back and he took Molly. And if anything happened, I swear to God... The police tell me that you're carrying a gun. Yes, I'm carrying a gun! But if I turn myself in, then no one will be looking for her, and then he'll kill her! Shh, sweetheart, listen to me, okay? Just breathe and listen. You have suffered terribly this past year, but you came to understand your anxiety, and that it was never to be acted upon. Isn't that what you've learned? Now, the police, they don't believe he ever existed. I do believe he exists, and I know what happened to you was real. - You believe me, don't you? - Yes. But at the same time, I know that he hasn't returned. When Molly behaved irresponsibly, when she wasn't home when you expected her to be, it triggered memories. Oh, God! Jill, he's gone and he is never coming back. He belongs to your past now. No. Sweetheart, come in right now. Talk to me. Before you hurt yourself or somebody else. I'll come up. - But only if you do something first. - What? Tell Sergeant Powers to leave, and when he's gone, I'll come up. What are you talking about? There are no police here. You're a liar. - No, I... - I'm parked downstairs, and I can see his unmarked cop car right in front of me. - Jill. - My judgment isn't impaired. She's downstairs. Suspect's vehicle downstairs. Take her. If it's rolling, put a stop on it. Hold up. - Ready or not, here I come. Where are my boys? I can't find them anywhere. Is one of my boys at the door? I need to talk to you. Come on out, boys. My friend is here. We'll play hide-and-seek later, okay? Why don't you watch some TV? Good spots. I never would've found you. Go ahead. I never would've found you. Have you been to sleep yet? Molly disappeared last night and the guy who took me took her, and it's going to get dark soon and he's going to kill her. I think I know who it is. I think it's that customer. The guy that gave us the big tip last night, the one that you said was moving away? - Jim? - "Jim"? You know his name? - Yeah. - Do you know him pretty well? No. He comes in every couple of weeks. We chat. - Did he ever ask about me? - No. He stares at me. Last night was the first time he's ever sat in my section. The only thing that he said to me was, "More coffee, please." I think he was just afraid that I would recognize his voice. It's time. Oh, God. You never got a good look at him? - Have you ever seen him with his car? - No. So you don't know anything else about him? No, not really. He lives alone. He works odd jobs. I asked him why he was moving, and he said he didn't like the women here. I said, "Why, what's wrong with us?" "Too skinny." I said, "Well, I'll take that as a compliment." Nothing else? - Well... - What? Tell me. I have his phone number. I threw it away out here. He gave it to me last night. Here's what I think we should do. I think we should give it to the cops and let them... Jill. Jill. Don't do this, Jill. Please, you need help. - Are you kidding me? - Here we go. - Okay, it's on. - Yeah, she's going for it. Orange Bronco. Oregon plate 071 Charles Baker Victor. Hey. Jill just left a friend's house in Ladd's Addition. Now her friend hears sirens and she's scared. There's a pursuit rolling in Ladd's Addition right now. Where's Hood? His mom's sick. He says he's bringing her soup. Oh, great. Check with dispatch. Find out what they're chasing. 951, we're southbound on Carver. We've lost sight of the suspect vehicle. She's blacked it out. She's taking the alley. Roger that. There it is. All right! In the car, show your hands! - What the hell are you doing here? - Where are your car keys? - Why? - Just please give them to me. No. If they catch me, they're going to throw me back in the hospital, and they're going to ask me a thousand questions, and I'm not going to be able to answer, 'cause I'm going to sound crazy. They're going to stand there with their notepads, and they're going to make me take all these pills, and when I refuse, it'll make me seem even crazier. Meanwhile, Molly is going to be dead, buried at the bottom of some hole in Forest Park, along with all these other girls that nobody's looking for. And then, one day, someone's going to accidentally stumble over their bones. And the cops are going to say, "Wow, what do you know? That Conway girl was right." And they're going to go on living their lives. But I will never be able to do that because I know that I didn't do everything possible to save my sister. And so how are you going to feel when you didn't help me? - Mommy, I'm hungry. - Yeah? What do you want, sweetie? Do you want an apple? My keys are in my purse on that desk. And don't you come back here. Jim here. - Hi. Who's this? - Jill. - Jill who? You know who I am. I know who you are. And I know you have my sister. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. You stared at me for months. You finally sat at my station last night, and then you went and you broke into my home, and you meant to take me, but you took my sister instead. - Is this Jill from the Lucky Star? - Yes! Stop it! Stop it. I left you a pretty big tip last night. Yeah. And then I went to your house to kidnap you? Why would I do that if I knew you were working the night shift like you always do? But you're right about one thing. I do know who you are. You're that poor girl who was abducted last year. The one no one believes. The police said it was a hoax and that you were crazy, right? Pigs. You sound like you're in a very bad place right now. Would you like to meet me and see that I'm not the monster you think I am? Maybe then you'll relax. Be happy. Smile. You may even like me. Okay. Do you want me to come to you? Or do you want to come to me? I'll come to you. Where are you? I'm sort of homeless right now. I'm just tying up a few loose ends before I move back north. Here's what you do. Cross over the St. John's Bridge and turn right onto Bridge Avenue, and take it to Springville Road for about three miles. On the left, you'll see an abandoned ranger station. Call me when you get there, okay? And, Jill, you drive careful now. - Hello? - Hey. Molly's back. - What? - I'm at your house
