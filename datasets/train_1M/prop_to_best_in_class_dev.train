to do in that context is forget all the equipment, all the rest of it, try and focus on the chap you're talking to in the studio, and just have a conversation with him. And if there happen to be other people listening, all well and good. And that is successful radio. And the same is true for television. Well, I've trailed my coat, I've said a whole lot of things in hopefully to intrigue you, to start you off, merely in terms of rather positive public relations, the media are good and they're lovely and you ought to encourage them, and really, my message in the very first part is what I started off with. Be pro-active, not reactive. Have I persuaded you? Have I convinced you? I don't know. This will come out in the discussion, informally and formally during the course of the day, but let me hand over to my colleague, who will talk about the other side of the coin. Yes. He's Mr Nice Guy, you see, he talks about going in when you have something nice and positive to promote and you think he doesn't actually read The Sun. For a small fee I'll tell you different. The news interview, on the whole, is event-driven. It's when something has gone wrong,, somebody, your local radio producer picks it up, he says, ‘There's been an outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease in a Butlin's Holiday Camp. This is terrible, let's go and talk about it. The Chairman of the County Council has just got food poisoning Where did he pick it up? What restaurant was he in? Have you ever inspected the restaurant? Etcetera etcetera. And that is the time that you have learn to cover your backside in sheet steel. And it's not always that easy because on the whole, news interviewers are a much tougher breed than the nice gentle Brians of this world who are the disc jockey sitting in a studio with two hours to fill, pile of records, let's get A, B and C in and do a nice ten minute slot with them. Mostly news interviewers are a much tougher breed. They know what they want and they intend to get it. They know how to set traps, they know how to ask you questions which will lead you into using emotive words, they will have you on tape, they will also possibly be in a position to edit that tape, and at the end of the day you cannot say, ‘I didn't say that,’ because I have a piece of tape that says you actually did say it. And if I'm a wicked, evil news reporter, I'm going to leave out all the nice, positive things that you said, because you went on for so long I'm interviewing you at half past twelve for the one o'clock news. What I don't want is ten minutes of waffle and one and a half minutes of pure gold. It's going to take me far too long to prospect for the gold. And I will have a piece of tape which says, ‘Well yes of course you would expect the Chairman of the County Council to get food poisoning in this particular restaurant because we have prosecuted him three times. It's the Chairman's fault for actually eating there.’ You know, you understand what I'm saying. So the golden rule in a news interview is: listen to the question and only answer the question, and then stop talking. I've interviewed people sometimes on what I call fishing expeditions. I have a very vague idea of what this terrible crime is that I'm trying to get to the bottom of, that you have rats in the basement of your best hotel, or you know, there's a house falling down somewhere and you've done absolutely nothing about a closing order, any of these kind of things, but I don't know a lot about it. But I have just a feeling that there is something there. And what so often happens is I ask a fairly innocuous question. And you're so anxious to justify yourself, that you answer the question, and then you go on to tell me all the background behind it, and in so doing you give me a lovely piece of information which I didn't actually have when you walked into the room. Now if I am a good reporter, in a sense I'm going to let the original question flow past me as a starter, I may use it, I may not use it. What I am going to focus on is this terrible guilt feeling which is coming out while you're giving me all this information, and I can see one or two nodding heads, I guess, I guess some of you've been in that situation. So news interviews: listen to the question, answer the question, and stop talking. If I want more information, I'll ask a supplementary. If you say, ‘Well, we do lots of good things,’ and I say, ‘okay, for example, tell me one.’ And I can ask another supplementary. You haven't given anything away. I've had to actually drag it out of you. Try and be positive, even though you are perhaps really with your back against a wall,in a situation that you really know that the department has done something really pretty awful. okay, you can't actually deny that this or that has happened. But try and be positive about it, and say, ‘Yes, this, I have to say this is a bad situation,, it's not a situation which has occurred before, we are taking very positive steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again, we have prosecuted Mr X, we have done whatever is appropriate.’ Don't end up being apologetic. That's not what you're there for. You are there to do a damage limitation exercise, to do the best that you can in difficult circumstances. ‘No comment’ means ‘as guilty as hell’. Even the police have learned that now. The police, if they want to say ‘No comment’, they say, ‘I'm sure you'll understand that I can't comment on that particular aspect, the matter is sub judice, you wouldn't wish me to prejudice the . That is ‘No comment’, but it's ‘No comment’ done in such a way that it is implying intelligence on the part of the audience, saying, ‘Well, you realize, of course, that if I were to comment on this, you know, it would prejudice either the chances of the prisoner if we catch him or, you know, any possible clues and so on .’ So it is very unwise. If you have to say ‘No comment’ then do give a reason for it. One of the things you have to remember is that you do actually know quite a lot about how the media operate already. You presumably all listen to radio, watch television and so on. You know the nature of a news interview. You have what? A ten minute slot roughly. And in that ten minute slot there may be four or five stories. So what does that actually tell you about each story? It tells you that it is reported very crisply, very briefly. And that should inform your thinking when somebody rings you up and says, ‘My editor tells me that this happened. I want to come and talk to you.’ The first question you should ask is, ‘okay, what's this for?’ Is it for a nice, Brian-type P R interview, in which case you think, ‘Oh good, that probably means about ten minutes? Twelve minutes? Something very nice, laid back, I can afford to expand.’ ‘No, this is for a news interview.’ Immediately your brain says, ‘okay, that's got to be crisp.’ So you say, ‘What is it you want to talk to me about?’ ‘Well, we've seen this article in the paper. We want to come and talk to you about — whatever it might be. Salmonella, Legionnaire's — I mean, let's have some real crises while we're about it. And you then have to say to yourself, ‘okay, now what — what sort of information are they are going to want and how crisply and briefly can I give that information?’ If you need statistics, jot them on a little piece of paper. You have to accept that you are going into an alien environment. And I can promise you that under pressure you may very well forget the name of your mother, your favourite aunt,possibly even your wife's name. So give yourself what help you can. If you're going to need statistics, just a little crib card. ‘Well, we've only had twelve cases of salmonella in the last twenty-five years, and this is very unusual,’ and so on and so forth. Give yourself a little bit of help. It will also help to concentrate your mind so that you do actually keep the statements reasonably brief. If you don't ask those questions, you are going to find yourself very confused, because you will not know what mode you are expected to operate in. Now, just as you'll hear about the hook, the brief, the repackaging, you will hear quite a lot about modes over the next couple of days. Because really all we're saying to you is, ‘Switch into whatever is the appropriate mode for what is expected of you.’ The news mode? Quick, short, decisive answers. P R, Brian-type interview? Expansion, give him a little straw out of which he can make the bricks, have a couple of good stories and so on. Learn to operate in the right mode. The other thing is that if you do ask these questions when the guy gets on the telephone to you, he's going to say, ‘Here is somebody who knows something about the media, who knows how we operate.’ And you should not let the media be like a juggernaut and roll all over you. You should actually say, ‘They need me as much as I need them.’ Because without you and, and other people like you there wouldn't be any local radio. So don't be afraid to ask the questions: Is this live? Am I going into a studio? Am I going to sit down comfortably in a studio and be interviewed, or is this guy going to come to my office with a piece of equipment like that, which we will be using later, a ewer , or a Nigra whatever piece of portable equipment they have. In which case it can be edited. Editing is both a good and a bad thing in a sense. It means that I can edit out any really awful mistakes that you make, or indeed any mistakes that I as an interviewer make, but it also means I can edit out some of the things you wish you'd left in. If you're live, you've got to dig yourself out of it if you make a real mistake, but if it's — if it's on a portable machine, if it's editable, be sure that it probably will be edited. Don't be pressurized into giving an interview. The phone rings and a guy says, ‘I want to talk to you about this.’ ‘Yes, fine. When?’ ‘Well, like, ten minutes ago, because I need it for the next programme.’ Now, everybody's instinct is to think, ‘My goodness, I must give way, I, you know, they really need it, I must talk to him down the telephone.’ Don't be pressured. If it's something you can answer quite easily, okay, you may feel you want to make a comment there and then. If it isn't, say, ‘I would like a little time to think about this, I need to get some facts and figures, I'm sure you wouldn't wish me to give you incorrect information. I will phone you back in five minutes.’ That gives you time to get your head together, to pick up any appropriate notes that you may want, it may mean you want to actually consult somebody else. Don't be pressured. Try not to go on the defensive. I've said, Be positive. But there will be situations where you really feel you may be defending a lost cause, because after all things do go quite disastrously wrong. But again, take time to think about it. Take time to say, ‘How can I present my organization in the best light? okay We've made a mistake.’ But try and always end on a positive note. And I think above all the message that we would want to to give to you is, Don't let the media happen to you. Try and be as much in control of the situation as you can be. There will be situations where it's, it's more difficult. Try and be as much in control of the situation as you can be, and ask the right questions. And then, do your best when you get there. And I think that's probably about as much as I want to say actually about the news the news interviews. I think, I hope we've pointed out to you the essential differences between what Brian would be looking for as a, as a magazine editor if you like, and what I would be looking for as a, as a news editor. okay? Right. Thank you. So — shall we split them into the two groups straight away, Liz? I — Yes, I would think so. Right. I think that — we've got three groups but we're going to make you two for the purposes of this exercise. Rather than just listening to us do all the work, we're going to divide up into two groups just to do one or two trial interviews as it were, to get the feeling for the thing, to get some of your opinions coming up. Can I suggest, quite arbitrarily, that you take all the people on that side, plus the three people in the front row, into the Right. We'll go over there. And — just for ten minutes, ten or fifteen minutes, and the others stay with me, and we'll just try our hands at a couple of Right. We'll start, and move on. One of the features of, of the media which I think I mentioned earlier, certainly to one group if not the whole lot, is that people in the media cut things to the last moment, and the final second, it's part of the adrenaline, we've a chance to, make people move in. Bob Satchwell? Yes. He's just arrived. Just arrived, has he? Well that's exactly what I mean, a very good illustration of somebody who makes himself more important by coming in fifteen and a half seconds late, which is not so late for a corporate session, but is late enough to, to make everyone worry and so on in that time. So I think what I will do is, in view of the fact that be brave and get here, I think I will still Yes. I think so, yes, that's right. various aspects. What we really want to do is to get him to respond to some of our press releases and to comment from his perspective of what the press is actually looking for. He's he's shot himself in the foot in one sense, because he doesn't know what we've said already, so he may come and say exactly the same thing that we've been saying, in which case we will cheer and you will boo. For obvious reasons. Or he may come and contradict everything we've said, in which case you will cheer and we We creep out the door! So let me just say a few things before he does arrive, and catch his breath and perhaps have a cup of tea, on, on a topic which we, it's not fully listed but I think is worth just mentioning, and that is writing for the press, because it may occur to you and in fact you may yourself on occasions, write things for the press. That's another way of doing things. You may write articles, you may write little bits and actually send them. There's a lot of free-lance work which is actually used in the media, and there's a lot of opportunity for people. In fact it's sometimes said that it's one of the very great privileges of the public is that they can, by dint of writing something, and putting it in an envelope with a stamp on it, get it to arrive on an editor's desk, and have the editor at least give a cursory glance if not a more serious glance at what's going on, so it's a privilege and it's an opportunity in that case. So I just want to run through very, very quickly some of the things which will sound very familiar, because a lot of the, a lot of the information is very similar to the information we've been putting before you in terms of the radio and television situations. There's always a hook. I mentioned earlier as an illustration, when you pick up a, a magazine,magazine or a newspaper or a local magazine or whatever, you are conscious of the hook. Perhaps you're not conscious, you're unconscious of the hook, but you do respond to the hook. You pick it up and you thumb through and you think, you look at a headline, you look at a picture, you first look at a first paragraph and you think, ‘This is, this is for me.’ And the same's true if you're actually writing something. If you're at the other end, you're actually producing something, bear in mind your opening sentence, your opening paragraph, your headline, your title, must actually hook people in. And if you don't do that, then you will not get your material accepted. If you do do that, then the editor will actually read it, because the editor will say, ‘This is somebody who knows what the game is.’ And they will see, now that is appropriate, this is something which could interest, could concern my readers, and yes, they will be drawn in and they will read more of it. So that's an important first feature in terms of writing. House style is very important. You know when I was giving the introduction I talked about targeting, studying and so forth. You're an idiot if you submit an article or a piece of any kind to a magazine, to a newspaper, without actually having looked at it, and studied it, and asked yourselves the question, ‘What sort of house style is it? How do they write? Is it formal, informal chatty? How is it actually written?’ Once you're doing that, in that, you're in the position, once you've done that, you're in the position to actually offer something yourself. Because you will not have it accepted if it is not in the house style, and there are conventions, appropriate, and quite different, according to the magazine, the newspaper, and so on and so forth, so you need to acquaint yourself with the house style. You need to bear in mind your target reader. Again, this is repetitive, but it's so important I had to keep saying it, that you know what you want to say, but does the person who's potentially the reader want to read it? The editor will know that, and the editor will be sensitive to the readership, and the editor will look at it, not through the eyes of an editor just as an individual, but will say, ‘Putting myself in the, in the position of my readers, would they want to read this?’ And they'll read it from that point of view, and they'll accept it or reject it on that basis. You want to provide material which is sufficiently different, not the same that's there, but conforms to the house style, conforms to the format and so forth, but is sufficiently different and new, that it's actually worth printing. If there've been a whole series of articles articles about health or about food or something like that, no way are they going to do anything else on the subject, unless it's, it's brought in a very fierce readers' letters column or something like that, in which case they may be open for another slant. So you need to be familiar. And it's very insulting to an editor to receive an article on a subject, when the previous week or the previous month there's been a very similar article, because that says, ‘This person really doesn't know what my journal's about, what my newspaper's about’ and so forth. So you really, there's no excuse and no substitute for actually studying. New angles on old stories. Now one of, a very good way of getting in, is actually to think of the editor's problems during the course of the year. Problems associated with festivities — Christmas, Easter, summer holidays, pancake Tuesdays, things like that. Each time this comes up, an editor groans and thinks, ‘My goodness, we've got to say something about this, but can we say something different?’ And that gives you a very good opportunity if you can think of something different, to actually put this forward. And it's very useful in, particularly in that respect, to give a bit more time, notice, I mean, several months in some cases, if you can actually signal, something that is useful that you can contribute and send it in, that will help them plan that far ahead. Normally you don't you wouldn't be working on that sort of time scale. Bear in mind the use of photographs. There are certain upper class journals that use photographs a great deal, so if you can get a good photograph of something, that will already begin to sell it, in a sense. And there are certain situations as if you can't have a photograph, in a sense, there's no point in it, because it, in itself, it's a rather dry little article, but if you can have a fun photograph with somebody doing something with it, that gives you another dimension, another possibility of a hook, another bit of scope for, for, for getting something into the media. So bear in mind photo opportunities and indeed getting photographs yourself and sending them in with appropriate captions to the magazine or newspaper and so on. In terms of photographs, do be careful how you handle them, do be careful how you send them in, don't write on the back the captions in ball-point pen so it comes through and wrecks the front of the photographs. Make sure that, sure they're good quality photographs, normally black and white, sharp, appropriate and so forth, and make sure that you've got sufficient details associated with it, often a good way of doing it is by having a, something typed on a slip of paper which is just very slightly stuck to the, to the back so the editor can actually see what the thing is and can take it off if he needs to when the picture is actually being reproduced. Bear in mind irritating things like perspective. If you're describing on the left is the mayor and on the right is something else, make sure it's viewed from the front of the photograph and not the back of the photograph, otherwise you'll get yourself in all sorts of difficulties and it may make a nice editorial, nice letters to the editor, but it would be very irritating to to the editor, because they hate having mistakes pointed out to them, and that's picture perspective. Very irritating to the mayor as well. Don't forget that if you are going to quote other people at length, you have to check on whether you're going to be in breach of copyright, you have to be careful how to quote things, and don't forget that if you are actually quoting you need to give some indication of where the quotation comes from and make and check out that that's all right , either by getting permission or, or actually giving, there's a certain degree of flexibility. You're allowed relatively small quotations of other people without being accused of plagiarism and breach of copyright, but you have to do it advisedly, so make sure you know the rules if you actually do this. Now, the last thing I want to say, because I know we, our guest is here, and so presumably has collected his thoughts and is able to leap into the breach, the last thing I want to say on this is, writing articles, writing pieces, is a game, another area where practice makes perfect. The skills come through doing it again and again and again, by sending them off, by getting a feeling for it, by practising. And one, if you ever wanted to do a bit of homework, to actually really get into the mood for something like this, you want to take a, a single piece, a single little newsy thing, and just practise, try and write it for half a dozen different outlets. You know, exactly the same thing, but changing the language, changing the format, and changing the so forth in such a way that it would correspond to a woman's magazine, or a local newspaper or a national newspaper or a, or a trade magazine and so forth. Exactly the same thing, that's a very good way of actually teaching yourself a house style. I always say ‘one last thing’, but I always add another last thing to a last thing because I'm an academic by nature and that's, that's the curse of the profession. Bear in mind how things are still to some extent put into newspapers these days. You start, by and large, with the all the story and the headline, all the picture, all the first paragraph, and then you expand, you go into ever-increasing bits,loops in terms of adding additional information. You see these, that's how these things are written. They're done because the old-fashioned way of doing a, putting something together is a paste-up job, you've got all these stories filed about all sorts of things, and then some editorial chap or chapess sits down with sort of paste and scissors and cuts the things off, and they tend to cut things off the bottom to make it all fit until it feels about right. This is done electronically now, but the principle is, is often the same, and the instinct is to do it the same. So if you're writing something which is in the form of a newsy form of activity, bear in mind the sort of ever-increasing circles. ‘Man Bites Dog.’ Headline. ‘Last Tuesday in Cambridge High Street a man got so angry with a dog he bit it.’ That's the first sentence/paragraph, and then you go into ever-increasing things. The point of that is that, by and large, you don't distort the thing very much by chopping little bits off the bottom until it actually fits on the page. That's the final thing. Right. I'm Can we cut and paste Bob? I'm going to cut and paste Bob. Bob, would you like to — Robert, would you like to introduce Bob? This is getting positively incestuous. Without further ado as they say, let me introduce to you Bob Satchwell, who is editor of the Cambridge Evening News, and formerly Deputy Editor, Bob, of ? Assistant. Assistant Editor of the News of the World. Obviously a paper like the News of the World has lots of assistants, more than deputy. Bob,is a local person, in fact he lives in the village of Girton here,and to, to, to my knowledge takes a keen interest in local news and in local local affairs,since he's been editor of the Evening News I, I, I perceive a more lively style creeping into the paper. I may be wrong. Right. okay, well one last thing, I start with the last thing at the beginning,strangely, I mean you're obviously getting all the technical details and all the expertise from people who know far better than I do, so I'm not going to go into much technical detail until perhaps a bit later, which might come up if we get a debate going or when I look at your press releases. Let me say from the outset that you may find it surprising that we have an awful lot in common. My first rule of journalism goes back to something which was written down or reputed to have been said by H L Mencken, who was a, an American prize-winning journalist and commentator. He described journalism as being about comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable. So should you. Now we also both suffer from ambivalence. On our side it's, you know, don't believe everything, anything, sorry not everything but anything you read in the papers, and yet, at the same time, every national newspaper on a Saturday night at about eleven-thirty gets a phone, series of phone-calls all saying, ‘Please settle this argument for us we just been talking about the winner of the F A Cup Final in nineteen forty-three’ or something, and that, you know, and, so we've got the public out there saying ‘Don't believe what you read in the newspapers’yet, ‘Settle our arguments.’ So, we're looked at in an ambivalent way. Part of the reason for that is because sometimes even the press gets it wrong, or at least we used to get it wrong. You'll remember in the bad old days, in the bad old days before high technology caught up with us, when we used to have more literals than in your average your average academic textbook, which takes some doing. And, you know, the sort of things which you can remember, which I can remember, some of the glorious lots of people Erm, I don't know. I look in peoples' erm shopping trolleys at Tesco and they er don't seem to er Don't they? No. And, nothing may me to buy it now unless it's recycled. No. I don't always do that. I try to get recycled erm notepaper and Mm. Yes I wo , and it's no more expensive Marg. You can get birthday cards a on recycled paper. Mm. And I Mind , they're a bit more expensive. And I know the Post Office prices have gone up with er cards. Post Office are very good! Well they didn't use to be Oh! on cards. Oh! I thought you meant you were . They used to do birthday cards in there, in the Post Office. They used to be from tha , and they still are in there. Yeah. See, the others, they're all about ninety nine Ah! That's terrible! for blank birthday cards, but in there they're forty, fifty for cards. They're a lot cheaper. Mm. But I refuse er, spend that on. Yeah. They'll think, ah it's only it's the thought that counts anyway isn't it? Er, the only thing I don't like about cards is now they've got these . No, I don't like them. No, I don't like them either. I don't even buy them for Derek. No I, I can't spend that. No I don't like them. I just like it when you open it it says happy birthday. Well, yeah. That's right. Or best wishes or some Yes. Yeah. Some something simple Yeah. yes. Well it's not meant anyway. Well it's such strong stuff. That's right. It's not meant. is. sentimental isn't it? Yeah. And I think and perhaps when I was younger I used to buy it for Derek, but I wouldn't go there now, no. He does? Does he? He doesn't really does he? Just looks a card and buys it. I bet he doesn't he even read what was in . That'll do for her! But some of Well them really! you pick a funny thing, ooh isn't that funny! Yeah. It'll just do for someone. Yeah. Mind you, it's not the same as those stupid Yeah. Card erm things, yeah. verse inside inside! Mm. I bought Amanda a card yesterday cos she was a bit down so I thought, oh I'll send her one a card, and I got one from . It's an old fashioned mangle, like mum used to have in the picture. When I phoned up she said what a lovely card! I said no! Cos that was forty nine I said. Yeah. Oh, she said, I'm gonna frame that one mum. That's nice! Really , really nice it was! Yes. That was nice. Thought she was a bit down so I thought well I'll er send her a card. They had a good job in the paper erm , part of the school. But it was only for year. But it's actually temporary that's what I'm, and erm it wan , it was starting in April so that was no good! Ah! Ah! temp, you know. They can keep the names in the school. That's what they do, they have a year off er totally, then they go back again. Well you can't got a mortgage Oh no! and what have you. No. But I think that won't be a problem. No. But I don't, not only that Marg, I mean, it's become like a , but the only thing I do object to is these people marching about, and they don't want to help pay for their children's No. No. and they want the funds, the the pennies there don't they? And nobody to erm, pay the costs of it. , but you can't expect it all! No, I wish erm you worked that as well. Cos I was telling the children . Yeah. cos people who get their noses in there . So I was trying not to talk . But I still don't think it hurts children to . Some it does. Some it does. Some it erm, I mean, I'll go Claire'll say, clean up the house! Clear up this mess! Well, as a family we overreact. I'm saying that but I , went on holiday with Mary and I was three years older than Mary and mum said to me ooh look after her Mary! And it wasn't I've never felt so embarrassed in my entire life Marg! No, but I think it's very difficult for a mum. Because what is done, I mean when I was in hospital his mum used to that try and pick up Yeah! your stuff. Yeah, but there's a , I can see how she does it because you've done it al , you know, for sixteen, seventeen years Can't get out of it. can't get out of the habit. No. But I don't mind getting in in the family , but you I always remember, when David was growing up, he was about seventeen or eighteen, his friends came round, they were going out somewhere and grandma was there and she said to, er to us in front of erm David's friends oh isn't he a pretty boy! I never, the look on everybodys' faces! I mean, imagine what his friends thought! And David's and his face coloured down Mm. you know. Ah but you never . Well, oh isn't he, I can see when she looking at him was looking at him, that's what . Yeah. Oh! And he, and he Mind you,. You know,. No! Yeah, but you do forget sometimes, you sa , you still think they're .. Yeah ! You know and what do you think I am? An and, and things like that, and yo it's automatic. Mm. And if want to check quickly in a car and I'm driving I automatically put the hand Now you know I've done that to Pam and she couldn't stop laughing! Going along driving . I said, I'm sorry Pam, I keep thinking your Ma Amanda . Now it hadn't occurred to me to do that because I never had kiddiwinks. No, you see, I automatically do it you see. Yeah. driver! It is funny! But then, I suppose, really erm, you never think when you're forty like, you never think of them I don't think so. I don't think that now. I know, now, you could but, but Derek's reading that prospectus in the car today and it's, it's in Cardiff and he said they write in there and say that you know, they want mature students and, and, and this that and the other, and er, they give them erm, priority and well that's rubbish! ? Well they, they sort of near enough said she wouldn't Oh! And yet, in the prospectus it does, yeah Yeah. so I mean really they say, they're all going in there and perhaps she's not mature enough. And I said, what do they call mature? And he said over twenty ones. I said . Well well well, she's mature enough. But erm will she be very disappointed? Yeah. last night.

Every night I expect. But I thought they were good. Er, the only one I didn't like was erm but she looked quite so Claire would call . Oh I thought the blonde girl was a Yes. bit wooden. Well, she wasn't as wooden as the other one. I mean, she was quite credible, but the other one wasn't even credible. Yes. Yeah I didn't look like it was her. Ooh she was very ! Yeah.

She did look nice! Yeah. And so simple Yeah. but so nice wasn't it? Yeah. But I thought the other girl was good. Er well I thought it was good how they did the se se scenes, they were Yeah. . So that was good Yeah. wasn't it? But, didn't one girl look crumpled? She ought to have an iron on er, the backstage. She Well I thought she was good though. No, I thought she were, I thought goodness knows ! Yes, but then she was . Derek said they'd been having sex! Oh I She was .

There's plenty to warm up there! Yeah! But then the other girl was like stick wasn't she? Oh! I know. But I thought it was quite good! And I thought Derek said Jean won't want to go again.

Oh well I haven't had anybody so fussy. No. He would have erm, if, he'd seen the erm those two bi bits in that door, or there's some o of a sort of slightly wider than other a little bit, he'd have gone ! Yeah. They all seem a bit wide, I must admit. I , I noticed too, that he hasn't got it straight like over the Oh hasn't he? No? Well , one or two of them are a bit sort of Yeah , but er, some of them are a bit out of true cos they're seconds do you think? Could be. I don't know. They may have been so er the But erm yes, but Joey would have gone nuts! Yeah. Actually, that's why Derek's never done tiling, cos he's not very good at it. Mm. Well Joey, mind you, it used to take Joey such a long time. Yeah. And, it used to take Joey such a long time that erm but still, I I must try and get out of that, but the trouble is it's in me now. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think er but I want it done properly, see what I mean? Well I thought it looked, I thought it looked all right. Yeah. Well I, when I went in this morning after you'd seen it, and I thought oh! Perhaps it's not so bad after No. all. It's the I not , I mean he should have grouted that little bit and he shouldn't have put Yes he should. that tile there actually. But then, Derek said they haven't got the time to No. fiddle he said. Now, with Joey, he would have He would of had all day. gone over once with Yeah. with , he'd have put them on one side and said Yeah. we'll put those at the top you see.

Mind, not everybody's got the money to erm pay for jobs have they, today, if they've been made redundant they haven't got the money. No. I think it's gonna better though don't you? Well I think it's gonna get worse before it's gets better actually, I think it's erm I don't know. I'm lucky enough I don't seem to get any out, you know, the times that I've said oh I'm not bothering this year. I actually got them back Oh! . Oh I think they ought to have them cleaned every year don't you? Yeah. That one's sort of exploding a bit again, like something I know when it does,it needs cleaning ! It all makes a funny noise! Yeah. It's sort of a louder noise than normal this, you know. Yeah. Yeah, so I think oh well, it's about time you came. Yeah. Actually, probably, could do with a new boiler thing I should think. A bit old isn't it? Ain't it? Yeah. Mm. so you need a new one. Oh do you? Oh! How long did it take you to get down here? About three quarters of an hour does it? Yeah. Yeah. A bit longer today cos of the fog. Well yeah. It was bad this morning. Was it? Oh. We went for a week's holiday at Salisbury . Oh did you? Well, cos of my back last year I couldn't go very far so we thought, where can we go for a break? And we went, we had a nice time. It was great! Where did you stay? In erm yes, it's the ring road, in a a a listed building. What was the road called? Do you know as you come in to Salisbury and you have to keep going on with the traffic, then it leads up to the bridge where the wa , where the river is. That ro , what's it called? It's got like the back of the supermarket, back of the er Marks and Spencers. No I don't know what it's . No. Was it? Oh! Yeah! throwing people out. There's about But five rivers in Salisbury. Oh are there? And there's a Yeah, they're all listed aren't but as we came we came in the way we would come, I'm a bit ignorant, so I suppose we were that's where you got the top, the first thing you come to is That big the roundabout er with a petrol garage at the top Yeah you then you go down a bit Yeah. to another roundabout Yeah. and then did you follow the ring road round through the ? Yes, the ring ring road round, yes, and then you College. Yeah. The next thing round is the church . Yeah, well i , on the left? Or on the ri Sort of op , nearly opposite that's the London Road that is. Yeah, then I think we went is there a road to left? Yes. Yeah. Is there? And road again drops you down into the, you go on the ring road of course, Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember. Anyway, it was a lon , there's a little restaurant in the road, and it was back of sort of erm Mar , if you wal , you crossed over and if you went through a little slip where it came, you came into this little arcade of shops where o , about in the road next to er I know where it is! You just told me it was, yes. Don't ask me! That sounds about right ! Yeah. That's sounds about the name. New Street? Yeah. I think that's in New Street. But the hospital ? It was by the hospital. It was in the road of the hospital. We were down, we were down much further and the hospital was that opposite the park, like, is it the park or something? Yeah, there is a park. No, we overlooked erm a horrible block of flats! That was very nice, the outlook there, but the outlook at the back was ever so, it was beautiful! Cos we could see the spire of the cathedral. I think it was in, it was in the, but it was in the back road of the hospital, not the front road. The back kind . Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I think so, yeah. I think there's a park there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, ever so, we enjoyed it. But it was very cold. Was it? Yeah, can't remember where we went. My memory's hopeless! You know, it was sometime last year and I can't remember if it's early or late. But it was quite nice, we had a nice time. There's lots of little walks to go on aren't Yeah. there? Round er, and they're all qui , er nice shops there. Oh! So wa Enjoyed it! got to the old mill then did you? Yeah. Yeah, it was nice. We thoroughly enjoyed it! I expect can you? What kind is there? Yo you can see why Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I think it's quite nice. The only thing is, I think it's quite a way for you to travel isn't it? Erm I mean, you don't always come here do you? Mm mm! Oh! Do you come here every day? Mm mm! Oh! I don't know if I'd wanna do that every day. Is it worse in the summer? Mm. Yeah. I don't know i But it's always better, it's not, coming in cos then all the tourists are coming back Yeah. to go to bed. That's right. Because when we came home, we came home on a Friday night, I say, and oh, the traffic! Mm! I think it took us about an hour and a half to get home! Mm. Especially coming up,co , just coming up to Salisbury, coming up to all those roundabouts. Mm! Cor! We thought we wished we'd left earlier now. Mm. It was, no I mean thoroughly enjoyed it! We'll try and be a bit more adventurous this year and go a bit further! But I can't sit in the car very long. It's terrible! It's a problem. Where do you hope to go? Well I was thinking of Cambridge but I don't think I, Derek's going to Holland Mm. for a long weekend to do with er, every ten years there's a garden thing in Holland, I don't, forget what they call it. Flor Florade or something. I can't go. I couldn't tra , it's er, on a coach. I couldn't do it. So he's going to Holland for three or four days. So I'm er I said perhaps, because Steve li , have you been to Cambridge? No. Steven said it's nice at Cambri , I think we've been through it. Yeah. Yeah, but it's quite, I don't know how to, it's about three hours I should think. You know. Have to wait and see. Cos you could break the journey up a bit? Yeah. I'd have to do it every hour. I can't sit for much longer than an hour. It's a pain innit! I never thought I'd have back problems! Mm. Nearly everybody you talk to the fact, they have back problems. It's a wonder you don't get them lifting boilers and things! Yeah, well . Yeah. And I said, Derek has to be careful, because you don't know when you Yes. And he was doing, and they're humping a lot of concrete last week and I think his back's aching. I said, now you know how I felt! How are your children? Alright thanks. Adults, children? How old? Well er , Jimmy's ne er, eighteen Oh adult. fourteen. Oh! How she's getting on? Yeah alright. Okay? alright. She'll be taking her O levels next year won't she? Yeah. Mhm. Mm.

I just think two or three years ago they took a Mm! kids, and then Yeah. wha , what was gonna happen when they all had to go back to work Yeah. I think mind, a lot of the problem is because women have gone back to work isn't it? Cos I mean, lots of women have to work today don't they? For them to make Pay the mortgage. No! Yeah! Yeah! Sad really! And Amanda didn't like our own school, cos she finishes her teacher training college this year. Mm. But it's four years! Cor! I can't believe it's four years. But apparently,yo you get wage increases in teaching. It's just had one haven't they? It's going up I think. But, the longer you stay the more wages you get. Yeah. But now what's happening is, they're getting rid of the old ones cos they pay them too much! Yeah. And get ne new ones in. I don't think, I feel a bit sorry for her because at the moment they're running a teaching profession down so much aren't they? Always! Feel a bit sorry for her, but she seems to be enjoying it so . That's the way to do it ! Oh dear! The frog's have laid some more frogspawn out there. What? The frogs. Oh! Put down some more spawn, yeah. Have they? Yeah. How many have we got in there? About four.

I took, she took her to Oh! Travers to have her nails done. Oh! I'm going to tell you a little bit this morning about South East Arts and it's support for the visual arts in the South East here. South East Arts is one of fourteen publicly funded regional arts associations in England and Wales, whose brief is to stimulate and extend the practice, understanding and enjoyment of the arts among the people of the region. Now, in our case that means Kent, Surrey and East Sussex. We seek to achieve this in three ways: by offering specialist advice and information on all aspects of the arts; by initiating certain schemes, projects and promotions of our own; and by subsidizing professional arts activity and arts organizations. And to put this activity into some sort of financial context, we have to help us a budget of roughly half a million pounds. That's mostly Central Government money, but partly Local Authority money, of which, to put my talk into perspective, some forty-eight thousand is available for subsidizing the visual arts in the region. It's this allocation that I'm responsible for administration, as Visual Arts Officer, with the assistance of an unpaid advisory panel of specialists, and subject to the approval of an Executive Committee which represents the public we exist to serve. Now, our visual arts policy could be summed up as follows: It's our main concern to bring about a social financial climate more conducive to the health of the visual arts than that which we find ourselves in at present. That means working to change things for the better. That in turn means concentrating our limited resources on fewer and carefully selected targets where we can, over the years, bring about change and effect medium and long-term and far-reaching improvements, as opposed to merely and inadequately propping up the status quo. Hence, the emphasis of our work which, broadly speaking, is concerned with helping either organizations, by which I mean galleries and arts centres, or individuals, in other words artists, craftsmen, photographers, and is increasingly directed to the former in the belief that if we can help them, these centres and galleries, towards adequate levels of staffing and expertise, they in their turn, and much less artificially than we, will be able to help the individual artist. With regard to galleries, then, we aim to support a number of strategically placed centres in, say, Brighton, Farnham, Canterbury, Folkestone, St. Leonards and Eastbourne, sufficiently for them, each doing their own thing, in due course to be able to service a touring exhibition network, made up of themselves and the other regional galleries, be able to offer the artist whose work they exhibit or promote a fair deal — that means paying them for their transport, insurance, publicity costs and perhaps a fee for exhibiting their work in public— and finally to organize appropriate marketing and education back-up to their own exhibitions programmes, which both pulls people in to the gallery and reaches out to them in, for example , schools and industry. Now, meantime, until this happy state of affairs has been reached and we can devolve these responsibilities, we continue to support individual artists directly ourselves, through a variety of schemes, all of which I like to think relate to making more of them accessible to the public. These schemes, then, can be summarized under the following heads: we run residency and award schemes, we run grants to artists and craftsmen and photographers, we run an artists in school scheme, which involves placement of and artist for two weeks or so in a local secondary school, we offer payments to artists for exhibiting in certain galleries, something akin to the public lending right, we also provide assistance for the purchase and commissioning of contemporary work, and finally we run an artists' register, which is a slide register of work of artists within the region, which is accessible to anyone who wants to come along and look at it, whether they are organizing an exhibition or thinking of commissioning a piece for their own living rooms, or perhaps a piece for their town hall or public library or whatever. Now, that's more or less as far as I've got, I mean I can go on. Making Good — A New Craft Exhibition. Making Good is an exhibition with a difference. The majority of the works in the show are so new that some were only delivered the day before the exhibition started. It is the first major craft exhibition that South East Arts, your regional arts association, has organized. The concept of the show is slightly different. The organizers have asked exhibitors to keep photographs, drawings, source materials, etc. and these will be on view as part of the exhibition. It is hoped that the inclusion of these items will give you, the public, the opportunity to understand why and how craftsmen create such beautiful and, in some cases, controversial items. Not all crafts are represented, but all the exhibitors have been carefully chosen by a very experienced selection committee, including the art critic of the Financial Times. Each craftsman was commissioned to produce one or more works especially for the exhibition, hence the tight schedule. All the exhibitors grasped the opportunity of the commission to push forward the boundaries of their craft. The results are very interesting. The crafts on show include pottery, embroidery, furniture making, book binding, weaving and silversmithing, a very wide range of crafts which we hope you will take the opportunity of seeing. If you live in Canterbury, Brighton, Farnham, Southampton or Portsmouth, the exhibition will be coming your way. Listen to your local radio for Making Good details. I've mentioned South East Arts as the organizers of Making Good. Hopefully you know something about this organization, or at least have heard the name. South East Arts tries to bring you the most interesting events in music, drama, literature and the visual arts. If you see the words South East Arts linked to an event in your area, there will be something of interest for you and your family. Why not start with visiting the Making Good Exhibition and you may find there are many more events of interest to you. If you want to know more, write to South East Arts, Crescent Road, Tunbridge Wells, or if you are particularly interested in crafts, either as professional craftsman, or as a member of the general public, contact me, Frances Smith, at Tunbridge Wells four one double six. This time of the year is alive with nostalgia. At New Year television and newspapers are concentrating efforts on identifying the most important, or even the looniest events of the past year. Not so at South East Arts. From our tiny office in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the officers, advisers and executive committee members have been using the Christmas weeks to look forward. To help ourselves we have not ignored the nostalgia trend, however, for we've been glancing back at nineteen eighty two to guess what we think will be the most significant arts ideas for nineteen eighty three. Using a system which consults all the staff and many advisers from all over Kent, Surrey and East Sussex, we have nominated five prize winners in very special competition which seeks to predict next year's most important people and places. In nineteen eighty two we have been very lucky to see an amazing patchwork of achievement, from major international exhibitions and international festivals' successes to local community enterprise. And nineteen eighty two may serve as a suitable reminder for us as we seek to identify those likely to make the most significant contributions in the future. What did we have in nineteen eighty two? Well, the Cliffhanger Theatre Company was the success of Edinburgh Festival. Channel Theatre conducted its first national tour with the three productions Sleuth, Entertainer and Dracula. A new director was appointed for the Epsom Theatre and we had agreement on the designs at last for the new Canterbury Theatre. A new gallery was opened in Margate, and nineteen eighty two was our first full year of the Polytechnic Film and T V Workshop in Brighton. Kent Opera's spectacular ‘Beggar's Opera’ opened at Tunbridge Wells, and the Picasso Exhibition highlighted the Brighton Festival. Dartford Theatre opened and ‘Barefoot Video’ has it's first year of full-time professional worker. The Rochester on Medway Dickens' Festival expanded significantly in this year, and Theatre Link, that collaborative effort between Guildford, Leatherhead and Farnham, did its first tour. The Kent Literature Festival expanded once more in nineteen eighty two/three and four new young musicians were appointed in an especially fine nineteen eighty two Young Musician of the Year competition. Hazel Kirkham undertook the Brighton survey of the arts, and the Old Market Arts Centre, so often a focal point of controversy in Hove, had a full report completed by Hove Borough Council and South East Arts. The Bletchingly Adult Education Centre saw visits from Kent Opera and Paul Patterson, and the Tunbridge Wells Trinity Centre had its first full season of live music and theatre. Glyndebourne's ‘Love of Three Oranges’ was one of the most spectacular productions they undertook in nineteen eighty two, and the Farnham Maltings' biggest production of the year was probably their version of the Royal Shakespeare Company's ‘Piaff'. We had two gatherings of businessmen in Brighton and London, attended by the Minister for the Arts, and a new director was appointed for the Lewes All Saints Community Arts Centre. All these and many more will be considered for awards in the following categories: Most impressive contribution by a major organization in the South East, most interesting contribution by a local organization in the South East, and most significant presentation in nineteen eighty two We have two further categories: the most imaginative idea developed in nineteen eighty two and the most promising project for nineteen eighty three. Follow South East Arts and you will be able to help judge these competitions next year, and if you're enterprising enough yourself in nineteen eighty three, you may even qualify for an award yourself. After my first six months as Director of South East Arts, I've prepared an interim report with five main topics, which I wish to put forward for public consideration, and if anybody has any comments to make perhaps they'd let me know. The first of these points is to do with venue and Arts Centre development. I would like to encourage the association to build upon the initiatives already begun by the Association's touring programme. I suggest encouraging a limited number of effectively managed centres, selected in part on a geographical basis, and in part for their value and interest to more than one of the association's panels. A programme of this kind will be designed to operate within a national Arts Centre development programme, which is at present being discussed within the Arts Council. The second point is to do with major client support services. Throughout the region and important client group exists, whose basic funding is provided by the Arts Council and their local authorities. The association might encourage the development of shared publicity and marketing to ensure as much effective publicity and ticket sales promotion as it is possible to provide, both for those projects and those which we regard and cherish as our own. Thirdly, the devolution of South East Arts schemes. Conscious of the increasing demands in terms of time and routine administration, the concept encourages South East Arts towards passing over responsibility for existing South East Arts schemes to stable and well managed clients for their future operation and management within funds agreed between us. Fourthly, local authority funding consolidation. Already appreciative of the association's practice of encouraging, where appropriate, joint funding and partnership in the support of all South East Arts clients, the association still needs to secure the full membership of all local authorities in the South East area and develop a clear, joint strategy on the development of the arts for each of the three county areas. And finally a Medway focus. Consideration of funding in relation to population distribution and the needs of the region seems to indicate a low and decreasing ratio of support from South East Arts to those areas of North Kent which can generally recognized as the Medway area. A re-evaluation of our current and potential interests in the area would help re-balance our contributions in geographical terms, and it just might introduce us to some useful new artistic interests and commercial concerns. This last autumn South East Arts tried and experiment in Brighton and organized a series of five so-called fringe theatrical productions at the Pavilion Theatre over a period of two months. Each production played for two successive nights, with the co-operation and active encouragement of Brighton Borough Council it is hoped to extend the use of the Pavilion Theatre as a regular venue to provide an opportunity of seeing wide-ranging drama of a kind not otherwise available in Brighton. For example, the first season included shows suitable for all the family, such as Medieval Players and Trestle Theatre, as well as some controversial productions. About one of these ‘The Vandalist’ which was presented by ACT Theatre Company and which is an adaptation of , one reviewer in a national paper said that in a festival abroad it would be the talk of the town. The theatre already houses ‘The Fringe’ during the Brighton Festival and attracts large audiences then. At other times professional companies play there with varying fortunes, except for Cliffhanger, which is probably Brighton's most successful company, they always turn people away because they can't squeeze in any more. South East Arts will continue its season at The Pavilion Theatre early in the New Year. There will be companies from the Evonana Theatre at Guildford and the Redgrave Theatre at Farnham, with David Mercer's last play and Pinter's ‘Betrayal’ which was first seen at The National Theatre. And to round off the season, just before the Festival, the inimitable and quite unrivalled Moving Picture Mime Show. If you're interested is this type of theatre and if you wish to see it regularly in the centre of Brighton, come and see these shows. If you want any more information, contact me, Bob Henry, at South East Arts, on Tunbridge Wells four one treble six. Suitcase Circus will be visiting Brighton this summer, with their own unique brand of circus. Founded by Reg Bolton in nineteen seventy six, he has since established a number of children's circus groups throughout the country. In nineteen seventy four, Reg spent some time at the National Circus School in Paris, where he learnt, amongst other things, that the life of a circus performer was not for him. However, he was told that the best use of his talents was with children's work. His group, composed of professional circus performers, approaches each project in a manner whereby all members of the community are involved. During the week the company work with children and adults on various aspects of juggling, stilt-walking, clowning, unicycling, face painting, and the week culminates in a street parade and a performance in which all take part illustrating their new found skills. During the weeks before the event local playschemes, youth clubs and other community organizations have been preparing costumes and props in anticipation of the visit. Funded by Brighton Borough Council, Brighton Trades Council and South East Arts, the even is guaranteed to be colourful and lively event. All are welcome. It takes place at the Brighton Community Association on August the fourteenth to August the twenty fifth. Further details are available from South East Arts. Mr President Ladies and Gentlemen as the Chairman of South Cambridgeshire District Council it does give me great pleasure to welcome the Institute of Environmental Health Officers to Girton College here in South Cambridgeshire this morning. I understand that your institution covers not only Cambridgeshire but also Norfolk and Suffolk, so my welcome is a particular one to those delegates who have travelled here from neighbouring counties today, and I trust that your journey on such a pleasant morning was a really good one and that you'll find that this symposium is going to be very worthwhile. I understand that this is the third Cambridge symposium, and this is the third time also that you have come to Girton College. Previous topics have been presenting the legal case, environmental health in Europe 1992. It seems that with such a background the theme of your thoughts during the course of these symposiums has been getting the message across, and certainly when you turn to the one that you have this time, of the media, you are really getting involved in getting the message across. As I said earlier, I'm pleased that you've come to Girton for this symposium, come away from your normal surroundings in the perhaps stuffy office in some district council to the beauty of the wide open spaces here out in the countryside. I hope too that this beautiful countryside and this beautiful college will be conducive to good thoughts, reflections and reappraisals, and if I might say to the men I hope there are not too many of the female students floating up and down the corridors to further divert your attention. Of course at the moment environmental health is very much an in subject, especially with the Environmental Protection Act of 1990, and your profession has the marvellous opportunity of seeking to safeguard the environment and also the threats that we have at the present time which are upon the environment,from so many sources but, most of all particularly in the eastern counties, from the population explosion, which we here in South Cambridgeshire know quite a bit about. South Cambridgeshire District Council has recognized the important part that environmental health officers have to play within the work of the District Council, and for some time now the work of the Department has been carried on under the hat of the Legal, Housing and Health Director. Quite recently the Environmental Department has become semi-autonomous with Russell Jones as its Chief Environmental Health Officer and we know the good work which Russell has done over the years. We're particularly proud of him in South Cambridgeshire, as we're also proud that so many of our environmental health officers like Alan Hobson do sterling work for us, and we are looking to them in the in the future with this semi-autonomy that they've been given to really take on board the opportunities which have been given to them under the 1990 Act to really go to town on environmental health. As we look around us, we see particularly in the field of litter that there is so much to do, and I'm sure that this is one area where we shall be looking to improve our country and improve our countryside. I'm very sorry that as soon as I have finished this welcome this morning that I have got to leave you, and I am very sorry that I shall not be able to return this evening for your dinner which I would originally look forward very much to but I trust that you will enjoy the company of the Chairman of our Environmental Services Committee, Councillor Robin Draga , who is attending on my behalf. We find today that using the media is something which we all want to do, we all want to get our message across, we all want to get over our aims and our objectives. Sometimes we find that getting across the message and the work which the Council is doing is not always an easy one. Of course in the past this has often been the lack fall of nature, I know. That's right, this is what I'm saying. So it's misleading er er er Well it can be but it c er er er er er I found it very helpful when I discovered that after I was saved. This spoke to me. Mm. It has come to my mind that it is contrasting er spiritual Yeah. spiritual life Yeah. Yeah. From a natural naturally . Through through the Yeah. the world. The material Yeah. world Yeah. It just seems that there's people perhaps no another way to put it. Hmm. Mm. Yes. But when you think of er It's not really referring to the beauty of the world. Ooh no no it's the it's the Oh no exactly i it's the far world it's referring to . Yeah. It's the what? The far world not the The unspiritual world that that we can You see the pride in the eye, that with that that that that can be can be another women or it can it can be cosmetics, it can be a dress to women or it could be another man. It could be anything couldn't it? Some the world ambiguous, I've always found it so anyway. Is it is it the world that's created and all the beauty of the world? No no no Exactly, I don't think it can incorporate that though. Have you seen about the bit Yeah, you read it out Sarah. My my Bible says Do not love the world or anything that belongs to the world, Yes, yes yes. then that one really. Not the world of people or the created world. But the world or realm of sin which is controlled by Satan and organized against God and righteousness . Oh that's entirely Right. That's the answer isn't it? Yes that is the answer. Mm. That's just the clear right reading dear. Well we've all loved the world, so it's g no good kidding No. ourselves is there? No. Because we love living in the world. Yeah but we've all loved And we love the world . The so called joys and Yeah. M m my translation I think m makes it quite definite. Everything the world affords, all that panders to the appetite, or That's right. entices the eyes. Yeah. All the glamour of its life springs not from the father but from the Godless world. That's right. Mm. And that world is parting away with that he who does God's will stands forever. That's right. Mm. But of course every everything which is not in Christ will won't it? Yeah. Yeah. I i It's only only Christ is the is the only thing that's e Is there any ending eternal thing isn't it? Eternal. Yes. Because we've all course I have layers of Yes exactly. Course there's nobody who loved the world more than what I did. the sinful man? Goodness gracious me. No but I think as your faith deepens and grows you're more aware of those. Yes . aware of it before Sarah. Because you were yo yo yo you were walking in darkness. As I said. It's wonderful when we come in to the light. I know And walk in the light. So you Yeah. these things don't you ? Yeah. Well the You're Yeah i it's it's not even a conscious not doing it. It's a it's No no a desire that's taken away from you. The things I used to do, I do them Well you put it in no more. Pardon? If you become aware of what really matters in your Yes. and this is growing isn't it ? Yeah. Yeah. That's spiritual growth. Is that spiritual growth? Yeah. Goodness gracious me. My first love was the bagpipes. And I really loved them. And don't you love them now ? And I was good Oh and I and I was a good player as well. A competition player. But I went to a pipe bag championships in Beeston and I myself completely. I says it's even ruined me for . Even I mean the Bible says, once you're in Christ you're ruined for the world. It says in somewhere in the King James' version, you're ruined for the world. And although I'm not I enjoyed the piping, I enjoyed But I was not at peace I says I says, you've even ruined me for this . Pardon? other than the bagpipes Bagpipes. But I er but I said to myself, God I'm even ruined with this. Yeah. No it's which is foremost. You put too much attention on that and not enough on That was very Yes yes that's what you make an Yes, it was my religion Yeah. at one stage . Yeah. That's right. Goodness gracious me. I'm sure the Lord's thrilled you play the bagpipes. Th th th th that's not what I'm saying. it's written in with this No I know what you're saying and I don't know why you should No no no with this It doesn't mean the same. No. before God. Yes yes. God come He Christ must come first . Yeah. Yes that's right. N nearly all idols nearly all idols Idols have their value. Yes. But they're idols because they take the place of God. That's right. That's right. And every every interest Yeah. can be can be e e e e every is interested in an idol. And we we we we and we're n not as long as it's put in the under God it's alright. You see describes it as what The lack of grace, there's no grace you know in the in in in the There's a person who's effected by these. They haven't come under grace. Hmm mm. When I was converted I lost er a great deal of interest, not completely, but a great deal of interest in in in fiction. In fiction? Yeah. Why? Oh yes he would. He he Yes he would and great deal as well Yeah Yeah. Yeah. I'm s I'm It's void isn't it? I'm sorry that I've lost it, like I think it perhaps Si has lost the pipes. Yeah. But er I I understand why, because it played too big a part in my Yes. imagination can take charge of it . That's bad. That's bad for you and it's bad Yeah. for him. That's right. There is a life s empty pride. here John's uses a most vivid Greek word,Allazonia You know that? Yes yes. Allazonia. To the ancient moralists the Allazon was the man who laid claim to possessions and to achievements which did not belong to him in order to exalt himself more. We've often met people like that who blow their trumpet er pretending they were somebody else The Allazon is the braggart. And C H Dodd calls Allazonia pretentious egoism. The man of the world is doomed to disappointment. And the man of God is certain of everlasting Joy. Now you can't beat that can you? No. Mm. You can't beat that. So have we got any more comments on these verses? One of the great dangers of today I think is is adultery, and especially Absol now adultery of nature and of the world. Yes. And of intellect Jack. Eh? And of intellect? Well yes intellect too. But there's many I was only thinking of the the tendency to care for the world and look after it and worship Yeah. it, you know. Cos it's so beautiful. Yeah. mm. People that carried away true beauty and the world, it's wonderful . That's and it's Mm. I'd also after imitations have gone, and they're very good imitations sometimes . Yeah. That's where they deceive us. Yeah. That's right. You see that y er I mean your chapel could become your idol can't it ? Yes Yes. Your minister can become your idol. Yes yes. Your home can be your idol. Everything can Oh very much so. Yeah. Yeah. Your congregation can become your idol. Yeah. Everything Yes it can. Yeah. trap. Now what's the next portion, verse er verse eighteen? Mhm. Dear ch little children. Dear children, this one says. This is the last hour. And as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many Antichrists have come, this is how we know, it is the last hour. They went out from us but they did not really belong to us, for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belong to us. Now he's referring there to those er people of false believers, wasn't he? Who left departed from the fellowship, I think, isn't he? Yes. And er but the last hour See how important fellowship and the church was to this man? Yes. Mm. If you went outside it you were lost. You were Antichrist. Mm. Er a aye but er but but but they but those who'll but is but if if if we we can get lost in our way if we break fellowship, can't we ? Yes. Not necessarily but we can. Cos it doesn't Cos you need fellowship don't you? Yes. You need it, to feed yourself. Even Yes. though Even though that it it might aggravate you, t does something for you doesn't it? Yeah. Yes I fully agree. But But er it was the Galatians that left wasn't it? I think. Surely it just means everybody against Christ? The well these are a people who No. were in the fellowship but they were They they get funny with they were false things or they some won't go that far. People are leaving all the time from the churches. And new Especially ones coming in. Oh es especially the pentecostal groups Oh we change over like this. Oh a terrible E I only questioned about something on Sunday coming home, and she said well, lady that were bringing me, she said well they won't have it. They won't have the hard teaching . No they've got. No Yeah. they won't have the hard teaching. No no. So they don't last very long. Well some do but She said the idea I mean she said about I was asked a question about an American we've got that is with us but he doesn't preach very often, and I said well where is he? I said er I I imagine cos I've been visiting his wife you see. They said well er I thought perhaps he was away preaching, she says oh no they don't want any of m our people used to go out a lot preaching, but they don't want any of them now because it's too deep for them to Yes I can understand that. And he's very straight, our pastor you know, he he tells 'em straight you know . Ooh aye oh aye, yeah. Don't mess about and er well I said I never find anything offensive but I think that's why it's best always to keep it so simple. Don't you ? Well it is a simple gospel . No it It is but Well it's not that I mean there's a there's a you but Ah but you name what it around the m around the Mansfield =field, and these Children, at School they know far more than I do at my age I think. And things that's going on, it's got to the children. Evil things it is. Oh yes . Yes. And and And saying you get people in you see. Perhaps come for the first time. Yeah. Well there's We don't know what their lives like any k way. E they come unto the word and e Well if the want to follow the lord it's different isn't it? But if No good hanging about is it? But he's very very straight about everything. Whatever the lord tells him to say he does it. And he disciplines her in front of the he'll discipline them Yeah but he'll he'll discipline them. in front of the congregation . And they won't and you see so But understood yesterday, they w they weren't they want to take it you see? Now. I see here's got such a lot on this but he says erm Well I've lost where I was. Antichrist can mean either the opponent of Christ Exactly. or the one who seeks to put himself in the place of Christ. Mm. Mm. Anti. Antichrist can be one who subtly tries to take the place of Christ from within the Church Mm. and the Christian community. Mm. The one who will be in open an oppos opposition, the other a subtle infiltration. he comes in many guises doesn't he? Yeah. Anyway. Er we need to choose the meanings for Antichrist. It can either way. The simplest way to choose is to think of it is that God is the incarnation Christ is the incarnation of God. Which he is. And goodness and the Antichrist is the incarnation of the enemy,det satan himself. Oh Yeah. Because the Antichrist is not merely somebody who comes along and er and ten times the the violence and persecution and all that. No. Like Hitler for example. The Antichrist is a very subtle very Oh much more subtle . Mm. Very much more subtle. guise of angels. exactly yes. Yes. the Antichrist is not so much a person as a principle. The principle which is actively opposed to God. Cos you see, those people who are working Not coming back to your fellowship is a illustration, they are really They they might be Christians, but they're walking in the l Well th they're allowing the enemy Yes. the there are choice, either submission or going their own way, the pride of the world Yes, and this is it, yeah. t to disobey what John was just saying in those previous few verses. Yeah. Er opposed to God and of which may well be thought of as incarnating itself in those men in every generation, who have sin to be the blatant opponents of God . Well a lot of people have been called the Antichrist haven't they? Napoleon, Mussolini, Hitler, the Pope and plenty others . Yes, all these all these Yeah. strong people you Yes. see. But er Antichrist is often a very much er And more harmless looking person. Oh yes he is Jack. Yes he is Mm. It can Yes. be the type that's very practical towards life, He can be i er that has no er psychology or similar to work miracles he will you know. Yes. But it can be a very direct, practical But communism communism was a form of Antichrist. Ooh Absolutely absolutely. N And Nero and Nero, according to Bartley was very much a a human monster. Yeah. Yeah. But to get Antichrist that we've got to d wh where a Is the one who might even proclaim the gospel to us but you know perfectly well there's something wrong with That's right. Yes. Look at , wonderful preacher. Did you No you never met did you? No. Gosh. What does it mean when it says it is the last time. Oh well Well it's the end of time, I says since the crucifi Looking for the Lord's coming aren't they? Since the crucifixion within the last time haven't they? Mm. Yes. Yes. I think And we should be prepared for the er For the lord's c Lord's coming last time . Yeah, yeah, yeah , yeah. I would have thought so. Mm. I would have thought so. See there's two words for time, one is Chronos and Yes. the other is Chiros Chronos is time, chronological time, so that when you say the the coming of Christ the time of Christ is near. It means that it'll come sort of next week, or the week after or next year. That's Chronos. Yes. But Chiros has a different and meaning of time all together. Time is is opportunity, it's occasion. It's er it's it's filled time. Yes. It's filled Yeah. chronological time. There's all the difference between live and being I Mean being time and being in God. Being in time and being in in the eternity. There's a quality of time and then there's just time. You just spend time, you waste time, you give Yeah I see. time away. But if you're wise you fill up time with what Mm. last. Yeah. Does anybody not understand what I'm trying to Oh yes, yes. yes fully I think. It's another way, work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Yes yes. Fits into that doesn't it? Because this is the l this is very important time. It's Yeah. a very important Yeah. time. It can make you feel very guilty Jack. If you are to worry too much about that because I often wished deliberately, where I could be doing something more productive for the lord. But don't you think you need to sit and be quite Well here again that's one of the arguments. Yeah. That's one of the arguments before Yeah. I think You need to what please? Well you need to sit and be quite with the Lord as to keep doing for the Lord. Yes you do, yes yes. In fact it's wisdom comes into that Yes. Yes. doesn't it? had er a who used time of course. Of course. He he was he's very keen on the use of time. He never wasted any did he? No, it's very important, important is time. The life above when this is past is a ripe fruit of Earth below. My favourite hymn. The life above, when this is past, is the ripe fruit of Earth below. Aha. The fruit of Earth below. Yes. Er The fruit of your works. Yes Yes yes. Mm. yes. Was it used to say keep keep saying buy up the time buy up the time? Yeah. Mhm. used to keep saying that . the time. Buy the time out of the evil days. Yeah. Yeah. Very challenging. Very morally challenging. It is. Mhm. Right. Anything more on this? Then we've got the verses Well b er verses nin Verses er Twenty twenty one. Twenty, you have an unction Ah, but you have of the holy one and all that you know, the truth and All of you know the truth. I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know that it and because no lie comes from that truth. So there you are, there's an interesting one, then unction as a holy ghost. What does it mean when it says you know all things. Well the spirit reveals it to you, that's what it's really saying isn't it? What does it mean? Pardon? I don't know all things. Well I suppose i it means that you know the difference between right and wrong cos we've only been We've been talking about it further up haven't we? Yes. Not being connected with the world, and being more spiritual. I suppose he means that. But you know all things, I mean Spiritual things. well no not spiritual kind of life and Mm. What are the full powers he claims to have? What does he claim to Infallibility? Oh well that's what he claims . No no don't laugh at that, don't laugh at that. There is something infallible, that's what they that's what they're saying here, that's what he's saying. Well yes yes there's there's something infallible in i i i In the unction. Why in the unction, Yeah. a a a i i it's infallible Alan. Yes yes yes yes But that's not the difference of a f That's a different thing to what the p papal er interpretation is of Yes I'm not defending the pope at all. No. No no. That's an entirely different thing. But I am defending the fact that there is an Ooh definitely. in the Church. Yes. there's a an Yeah. Yes there is. We know in whom we have belief. That's right. We do know. Yes. And that's the truth. That is the That is the last word. Yeah. So we we have got that er that very important o knowing all things. I think it's wonderful. There's such a lot of er erm extraordinary sayings in this er epistle. Acts ten thirty What does Acts ten thirty eight say? Say what? Acts ten, verse thirty eight. There are reference to that for for for verse twenty. A God for Jesus of Nazareth, with the Holy Spirit and how he went around doing deed and healing all around him power of the devil, because God was with him. That's when g wh that's that's when God and Antichrist. Yeah well well yeah. God went out to Jesus. Er well he anoints us you see? Doing exactly the same thing. Second Well I mean really the healing was their faith wasn't it? Of the The healing was done through the spirit. Yes but One change was Two Peter one twelve. Two Peter one twelve. One twelve. So I will always remind you of those things even though you know them as a firmly established in the truth. You ha Prophecy of scriptures. That's Peter. And therefore my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling an election sure. This is what you were saying about buying up the time, John in a way, isn't it? Yeah. For if you do these things you will never fall. In other words you will not slip up and fall from sin I suppose. And you will receive a rich welcome which 's hymn says doesn't it? Hmm. into the eternal kingdom of our lord, the saviour, Jesus Christ. So so there I will always remind you Peter says, I will always remind you of this things that if you buy up the time Yes. even though you know Even although you know it. And they will e they will establish or continue to build it up. Yes yes. That's what it's really saying isn't it? Yes, keep on keep on Yeah. keeping on. I think it is right to refresh This is the job of the preacher really isn't it? Or the teacher. I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live, in the tent of his body. Because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus has made clear to me. So he must have been in Yeah,Aye. And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. So in other words I'll I'll raise up somebody to fill my shoes I suppose. Yeah yeah. Marvellous isn't it? Yeah. I think it's thrilling, I Any more comments? What verse are we up to now? Have we done twenty one yet? Yes we have Yes. Twenty two Mm. Mm. really Yeah we've done that. refer to it. Yeah. Then we want the verse twenty two. No lie comes from the truth. Twenty one. Who who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the is the Christ. Such a man is the Antichrist. He denies the father and the son. Now who blatantly denies that Jesus is the Christ today? I'm asking. All sorts of funny religions I should think. Quite a few. Jehovah's Witnesses. I don't know whether they do or they don't. Could we Before we get today, could we say that these are the gnostics aren't Yes yeah yes the gnostics them. But are the gnostics of their time. Yeah. Because there was just as much unbelief then as there is now, Jack . Yeah. That's the way . Yes. Yes. That if If the enemy wasn't Yes. active wasn't it? Well a Jehovah's Witness came to my door and said er Jesus Christ was not the son of God. No. I think they said Jesus Christ is not Is not God . God. That's what they said. Oh they believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God, alright. No. Not the Oh yes. way he put it. this is the j He he said he was a prophet. They don't they don't accept him They came here for years, Yeah. but I've forgotten what the teaching was. What was the teaching? on what he was saying. But that's how he put it Ye er there's but not equal with God. That's right. That's right. Son of God but but Er that's right. But the Mohammedians say it's impossible for Jesus to be the son of God because didn't have a wife, and it's as simple That's ex that's exactly how the Islamics view it. How on Earth can he be the son of God, because God didn't have a wife. And it takes a man and a women to produce a child. That's how the the Mohammedians see that. S with the Jehovah's Witness, I don't whether they come under this category or not. No I don't I I read their Bible once and it said at the beginning, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was a god. Yes. They believe in the divinitive God but not in the divinitive Jesus Christ. Yes yes, yes. word not God but the word was a god, it's just that difference between a little G and a capital Yeah. That's right. is is the divine Christ. And in there's a there's there there's a similar confession in in Chapter five five. What does chapter five five say? Who is he that overcometh the world. But he the believeth that Jesus is the son of God. He that overcometh the world. But he believeth that Jesus is is the son of God . Well I would doubt if the Jehovah's Witness overcometh the world. Having nearly become one. Not in the sense that you and I know it anyway. Overcoming the world . Pardon? They're they're a religion that in erm in er organization. They worship their organization. Yeah but they're in no as well. They'll the the it's it's a law job isn't it? They try to keep the law. Their law. Yeah. Well they would say it's i i but but there are old testament type of belief, I think. Actually the er Jehovah Witnesses were some of the most er s strongly opposed to Hitler Oh yes. Oh yes, they were They were But they were very much more strongly opposed to him than were many orthodox Christians . Oh yes. Aye. The Jehovah's Witness they're opposed to all sorts of tyranny, the Jehovah's Witness. Mm. Look at Dr the leading Presbyterian was persecuted to the Jeho the Jehovah's Witness you know. They maybe even murdered them, I'm not too sure. Yeah. Yeah. Cos they're against churches generally aren't they? Well the Antichrist is the church. Yes, yes. I used to go up past there believing the that the minister was the the represented the Antichrist. I did. I did. Because that's what they teach. Jehovah's Witnesses call Christendom the Whore of Babylon. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And that's us. Yeah. And that's and that's us. Yeah. Mm. That's what they call Now us, Christendom. erm five six, this is the one who came by water. This is the part of the What what verse were we on? Because I've forgotten. We're on twenty two . Twenty two. No what verse? Twenty two. Twenty two aye. two. This is the er er Jesus the Christ such a man is who denies him. And then my study Bible suggest that we read this. Water symbolizes Jesus' b baptism, and blood symbolizes his death. These are mentioned because Jesus's ministry began at his baptism and ended at his death. Who is reaching who is rea John is reacting to the heretics of his day, the gnostics. Who said that Jesus was born only a man and remains so until his baptism. I think Jehovah's Witness don't say that. Ah. At that time they maintained that Christ the son of God descended on Jesus but left him before his suffering on the cross. So that it was only the man Jesus who died. Throughout this letter John has been insisting that Jesus Christ is God as well as man. He now asserts that it was this God-man Jesus Christ who came into our world, was baptized and died. Jesus was the son of God, not only at his baptism but also at his death. Is that thing still going? Can you see it going? Yeah, when it stops let me know cos I'll turn it over. This man this truth is extremely important, because if Jesus died only as a man, his sacrificial anointment would have been sufficient to take Would not Would not have been sufficient No. to take away the guilt of man's sin. That's right. The spirit would testifies That is the holy spirit testifies that Jesus is the son of God in two ways. The spirit Jesus is the son of God The spirit descended on Jesus at his baptism, and two he continues to confirm in the hearts of the believer the apostolic testimony that Jesus's baptism and death, verifies that he is the Christ, the son of God. I believe myself, that there is no conflict between the human and the divine. None at all. They are they are one. I don't know what you mean Jack, The human is divine and the divine is human. The spirit came upon Jesus at the baptism,upon a man, upon a man and it came upon him It raised him from the dead. Mm. On the cross as the son of God. And er I am I am a great great believer, but I feel out of that myself, as one of the things I'm feeling out of. Mm. The spirit is human and the spirit is divine. There's no con There's no necessary conflict. We always associate humanity with sin, course we do Yes. and we mustn't do that. Real humanity before the fall Oh yes. was one with God. Yes it was. Yes. Hmm. And that's what it was with Jesus Christ, it's one with God. Absolutely yes. Mm. Mm. And that's what it should be with us. One with God. Yes yes. Yes. But we won't let it a hundred percent till we're there will we? No, but we are human, which is a good thing. Yeah, cos I've heard some people stand up, pronounce that A lot of people find religion very artificial and er They do and and I do. Yes. That's right. Speak more about it then brother. Mm? Say some more about it. What? Enlarge on it. Well I I find all religion artificial. Yeah. He's talking to the word religion, aren't you? Yes. word religion. Yes. And that's Yes, well I never use that word actually myself , That's isn't it? Yes. I use the word spirit. Mm. Spirit? Spirit is human and divine? Do you believe in the divine? Well of course Yeah. I'm a Christian. Mm. Yes. I think what you're saying Jack is a is a wonderful comforting feeling. And it gives one a peaceful feeling within Yes. That the naf that the natural and the divine are linked. That's why I feeling out of it I think. And I think this is er erm a peaceful feeling within us that we need to feel. We don't always want to be testing ourselves all the time, do we? No. I don't think Christ meant us all the time to Testing ourself? Well we are. We don't. We're we're Are we We don't Well we are to a point, you're saying well they're You feel guilty at times, that you're not doing enough. But I no I know I I ca I know I I I I I I isn't it? d I don't think I even I don't think I even feel Did I say guilty? Cos I don't think I do feel guilty . Well you did feel guilty, I think you said that . But I I I I I I don't know I er I I don't think I do feel guilty. I just say to myself. I s Well That you could be doing more. But I'm quite happy not to. I think. I think so . Yes. where the guilt is. Yes. Yes. Verse twenty four now is it? Thank you. Mm. See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. Yes now that's dynamic isn't it? If it does, you will also remain in the son, and in the father and this is what he promised us even eternal life. You see the son and the father and you and all the names Yeah. Isn't that lovely? It is. Yes. That's It is That's what I'm talking about really . Yeah. Seems to me that John is trying to er establish and and pursue the fact that Jesus Christ is You you see if you think right back. In the in the very beginning of our Bibles er the the the prophets and all such people were wanting to establish the fact of God. God is spirit and then when Christ came, when he was born, people had difficulty, great difficulty in accepting him as being of God. Yes they did. They did. They did. And and this is what I think what John is trying to get over. Yes it is. I think so. Yeah. Yes he's Yes. trying to establish the fact that Jesus is God. That's right. Mm. A and that and that he he was born God and that died on the cross as God. Cos there cos there was Yes yes yes well of course. those other Whatever they called them Galatians were were saying that he was only God from his baptism to Not on the cross, before the cross . You see I Jesus all sort man. Yes because he was man and spirit wasn't he ? Yes of course God and He must have been. He was the link from both of us. But I think the the the hardest thing is to accept the fact that he is God. We we we know But that he we've but but but got the record of his birth and his growing up. His development . human form. But yes but e e but er but when the spirit quickens you as an individual, at least I had no doubt that he was good. Immediately. You see the word man is ambiguous. We're all men, if the ladies will excuse me saying that, we're all men and men are human. We're all human. But are we human really? Are we human enough? Are we really human, right through?but Jesus But Jesus was human, right through. Yeah. Yeah. He was a man, the man the capital man. We're imperfect anyway aren't we ? Yes. Mm. Imperfect. But the capital man, and God, there is nothing to distinguish between No. them. No. They're one. Yeah. I and the father, Jesus said, are one. And er I I you are going to be in thee and I going to thee in you. And then he spoke to his disciples,wonderful unity. I think it's fantastic that. Yes isn't it? Very comforting. It is. It's comforting to me. And John says I'm writ Yeah, it is to me as well. He says I'm writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. Mm. Mm. Yes yes. Now you see,i isn't isn't it remarkable that the Jehovah's Witness tried to lead us astray, but the minute Christ came in they were wasting their time. Jehovah's Witness isn't it? They came for six months after seven day wonder, something had happened to us. But er they realized Now and every time I she'll ask me, and she'll say . Er Where were we? Verse twenty seven is it? Yes. Ask for you the anointing you receive from him remains in you. And you do not need anyone to teach you. Now this is Some people would take that literally. And proclaim that literally. But it doesn't mean exactly what it's saying does it? No. No. But as his anointed teache er as his anointing teachers you All things. about all things, and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit, just as it has taught you, remain in him. we've met people who would say read your Bible,holy spirit very quickly. And you don't need u go to church and listen to the preacher. No. Oh dear. So Oh dear. that is a real Aye. So we're back to the anointing there aren't we? Can I read that verse in my Bible? Yes. But the anointing, which ye had received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not have any man teach you but as the same anointed teachers you all things, and is truth and is no lie and even as it have taught you, ye shall abide in him. Yes. And that's the secret, we should read the word and let the word read us. Hmm. That's another way of putting it isn't it? Mm. Let the words read us, cos it's God reading us isn't it? Mm. Of course God does speak to us through humans beings. He does. Yes. People and they're not only preachers or teachers or so on Yeah, that's right. but er. You We learn a lot from one another actually. I was going to say That's the idea of this meeting isn't it? Gosh And also the experiences of life. That's right. Yeah. Yes, yes. Which is more so isn't it? Yes. Oh gosh, aye. We would be we would be Still be very immature if we didn't have one another, wouldn't we? Yes, indeed Yes. Michael, when he was at s When he was at school, he won a scholarship to university, when he got to the university he said as if he'd made a great discovery. He said Dad, there's a lot of people know a lot more than we do. already the intellectual. Very touching tribute to humility. Mm. Mm. Yes, very good. And the Of the natural world. Eh? Of the natural world. Yes that's true of the spiritual world to isn't it? I thought in your case it would be more the natural. Now where are we? Verses the last two verses innit? Mm. And now dear children You see we're back to the children again aren't we? Mm. continue in him so that when he appears we may be confident That's good isn't it? Confident. and unashamed before him, at his coming. Right? If you know that he is righteous you will know that everything everyone who does what is right has been born of him. That's the test that's the test isn't it? It's very hard That's the test isn't it? Mm. has some interesting comments to make about these two verses . Well he's got a a a comment verse twenty seven the anointing. You have received the anointing of God's holy spirit, he is your teacher, the spirit of truth who will guide you into all truth. He will teach you everything. Jesus promises that. And what does the holy spirit teach you? It teaches you remain in him In other words remain in his word and let it remain in you. Live in Jesus keep walking in his way, looking to him who is the author and perfector of our faith. Not looking back or down or in but up to him. And the outcome And now dear children, verse twenty eight, Yeah. You have been crucified with Christ. The old nature has been crucified, the new has come. Behold all things are new. So that it is no longer you who live but Christ Mhm. who lives himself through you. As you live in his righteousness and holiness, by his spirit and presence within you, so you That's us. may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. When he comes back again, which he will come to judge the the quick and the dead. And the blood of Jesus This is marvellous isn't it? The blood of Jesus washes your shame away, because Yes. he has accepted and forgiven you. It is marvellous isn't it? Yes Mm. that's wonderful. Can't loose. Can't e you can't loose in this Mm. Aye. Marvellous isn't it? Yeah. So that's completed chapter Two. Two. What time did you say you were going Jack? Oh well it depends on the light. I I'll go about ten to nine, five to nine. Ten or five to nine. Another quarter of an hour. Eh? Another quarter of an hour. Yes, got another quarter of an hour. So we move on to chapter three. You needn't stop because I'm gone. Chapter three. Would somebody like to to read the first two verses of chapter three? How great is the lord the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of God? And that is what we are. the reason the world doesn't know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends now we are children of God and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall him as he his. Everyone will have this hope in him Yes. purifying himself just as he is pure . That's wonderful, Isn't that marvellous isn't it? Yes. And I love the word hope there don't you? Yeah. Yes. Good isn't it? See Yes yeah. but rightful You can't get away from that about the about the creation can you? It's it's brought us back to J to John one again hasn't it? The first verse in John goes In the beginning,Genesis one,was the word. The Greeks used this term not only of the spoken word but also of the unspoken word. The word still in the mind. That's interesting isn't it? The reasoning, when they applied it to the universe, they meant the rational, the principle that governs all things. Jews, on the other hand, used it as a way of referring to God. Thus John used the term that was mean meaningful to both Jews and Gentiles with God. The word was distinct from the father was God. Jesus was God in the fullest sense. I'm on John twelve, the sons of God,He gave the right, the membership in God's family, is by grace alone. Cos you remember last week we accounted for er He was in the world, and although the world was made through him the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own,that's in other words that was the Jews wasn't it? But the Jews did not receive him, yet to all That's Jews and Gentiles,who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become the children of God. And that was, children born not of natural descent nor of human decision, or a husband. But born of God. In other words, born this been born again . Born again. Marvellous isn't it? Many shall appear who shall be like him but we shall see him as he is. Do you understand that? Verse whe What verse is that? Two isn't it? Are we a children of God and that we will be as not yet been made known but we but we know that when he appears we shall be like him. In spiritually speaking anyway. For we shall see him as yet I should imagine it's a spiritual condition isn't Yeah. it? It's extraordinary isn't it?be changed by just looking at it? Yes. Just by seeing it. Now Colin's got a er another dissertation about verses one and two here. That is the glorious promise of what you shall be. verses one and two. Mm. Yeah. You can't imagine what it will be like, but when the day of the lord comes People don't realize that that the lord's coming back, and they'll be a day of judgement. They don't do they? They never think about it? but when the day of the lord comes, you shall be like because you've been born gain in his Yeah. spirit. Mhm. That's why we'll be like him. All those things about your soul that you kn know dishonour him, shall be swept away. We got The rubbish won't it? You shall be like him because you shall see him as he is . He is. Mm. Somehow that moment will completely on about , wasn't it? Mm. will complete the work of perfection, that Mm. God has planned for you and me. God's anointing remains in you, his spirit teaches you, you're to remain in the spirit In other words living in Christ. The father has lavished his love upon you my making you his child. You will be confident and unashamed before Jesus at his coming. When he appears you shall be like him, for you shall see him as he is. Now that's the promises. Mm. Yeah. Marvellous isn't it? Mm. Gosh. Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure,That's that's Colin goes on to say,because you shall be like him does not mean that you are to care little about how much of him can be seen in your life. Now,far from it because because he is pure you are to seek purity of heart and now. Purity of mind and thought. Yeah. Purity of desire and affection, purity of life and action. Living the holy of God's holy people in the power of the holy spirit. Yes. Mm. Marvellous isn't it? Hope hope purifies. Yes. Yes I Pur think that Isn't that marvellous? isn't it? I went to listen to him at the methodist church at er Newark about Oh quite a few years when Oh. I just came As Oh aye, Colin? you know I only wish I could have heard him Colin at the Methodist ? Yes , he was at the Methodist. You know that very large church at Newark? Was he in there? Yes he'd but no at at erm No Dennis you've got the wrong place. Mansfield. Ah. have very large Ma er church street. Bridge Street. and I I was taken to it by friends. Yeah. And I heard him and do you know, he was powerful, the way he Ooh er Who is this? Colin who'd erm Colin He lives at Who erm He's an Anglican Matt's reading from. And erm but it was most inspiring But I would appreciate it even more now Yeah. Mm. than ten years ago. Mm. And then verses five to six. You know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And then in him In him is no sin. No one who lives in heaven keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or knows him. Colin goes on to say, there is no sin in Jesus,You were saying Jack. for sin is whatever opposes God. Now there's an interpretation of sin. Mm. If you live in heaven you live in the sinless It would be totally inconsistent, therefore, to pers to persist in your sinful ways, opposing God in your life. Now the Galatians said it was okay to do that. Those who claim faith in Jesus but do not demonstrat This is what Our friends John. but do not demonstrate a life that is lived for him Yes. Do not truly know or love him . Faith without deeds. Yes that's Mm. right. The power of sin Matt. no longer grips, Yeah. our life. Even though you can still sin. Mm. Mm. You no longer have to. Mm. No. Grace transform the fate. Yeah. Grace transform the faith? No the fate. Fate. Yes. Yeah. Verse five is it now? Four. Is it? F Well i did five and six just now. Yes well then there's seven isn't it? Seven. Dear children do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right, is righteous just as he is is righteous. Just as Christ is righteous? Yes, yeah. He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. Verses nine. No one This is a hard one, this you know . Mm. No one who is born of God will continue to sin. Because God's seed remains in him. He can't go on sinning because his he has been born of God . Of God. This what I asked you the other week. When you say when We do. We do to be sinners. But we do sin. We're we're free We should be free. Should be but we do. I think we just No and we make mistakes Matt, but we don't willingly sin. I don't know,myself. We certainly don't need to sin. No. No. I mean, if it's pointed out to us by the lord we we try and overcome that don't we? Yes, Whatever it is. Yes. God has made you righteous. And you And you can do what is right in his sight. You are no longer a child of the Devil, in rebellion against God. You no longer need to persist in sin. Jesus has destroyed the devil's work and delivered you from the power of sin. God lives in you by the power of his spirit and he will guide you into truth, life and peace. Not sin. If you follow his leading in your life, you will not persist in your sin. Is that what you're saying, Janet? Mm. not in your head. This don't understand it. Well this but you don't s persist in sin do you? Don't really want to sin. No you don't. you don't. But sometimes we slip up Pat. Yeah, we slip Yeah. This does not mean that you will never sin Right? Mm. This is what you're saying isn't it? Mm. but if you if you desire to glorify God then you will not willingly or wilfully persist. Mm. This is it, yeah that's it. That's the way of putting it, isn't it? We know the difference and we are aware right away doesn't it? But to think that we do it Yes Yeah. When God points out your fault you will come ready to him and repent in his in because we get back to the first chapter, verse nine. I was never out of that for the first few years I was saved, I was always getting in there,confessing my sins. Nearly wore the carpet our in the bathroom. Getting down to I remember one, David said, you remember too, after he had committed that terrible Yeah. crime and it was with her husband. He said I was born sin. And I said excuse. Yeah. presumably God Yeah. accepts Yes I wanted to say that . I was born in sin and shapen in iniquity. Yeah. Yes. That's the excuse he gave. Yeah. And it wasn't rejected. I think it's part of our nature. We are born in sin. We are. We are shapen in iniquity Yeah yeah , we are. Mm. And there's a conscience as well as a There's an unconscious, As well as a conscious drive in us, which often is not very good. There's a force within us, Yes. which will lead us on to resisting Christ, Yes. Yes. Yes , that's right. A a and when you're born again, that's really we but that power without doubt has been broken . It's destroyed. But it's that It Well not not entirely not destroyed broken It's been broken. It's been broken and that Mm. and that's marvellous isn't it? Yes. Because i because people will hate you and I because they don't hate us Yes. but they hate Christ . Yes. That's right. Mm It's a It's tremendous isn't it ? It's the hauteur isn't it? Pardon? It's the hauteur. Yes. And I've had to believe in the power of the subconscious as well as my own responsibilities , Yes , yes. but there is a power of the subconscious . Yes. There's a power of the unconscious I think, I think. Power of the unconscious? Power of the unconscious . I would have thought so. Yes yes. In other words for er si the heart is deceitful. Yeah. Very deceitful. But don't you think Jack, all stress should be taken out of it? All stress Yes because should be taken out of Yes, of ourselves because we should be in a peaceful. Surely we should be in a joyous peaceful Yeah, if we could if we could be working really in the spirit at all times, yes. Yes yes yes . Yes. If we were really working in Christ all the time, yes I think Yes but I I think God's got the pattern for us Yes he has, providing we can work really in Him, all the time. But this is where we fall short Exactly We fall short, Oh we're we are Yes we are joint we are an equal with Christ, a joint with him, Mm. I know, but I feel we should stress the peace that that we're given. Yes, well we are given peace We should stress Yeah. the power. Yeah. And the power, Yeah. And the grace we're given Yes, oh yes . And the love we're given . That's right, hit again This is the this is thing we should be That's the message, that's the message. That's right . Yeah. And I mean That's what the the preacher should be this is what you want to say to other people isn't it ? That's right Yes. And that's what the preacher should be Oh they say to me have you seen the sins of the world? Have you That's it. seen what Bosnia's like? That's it go on Have you what this is like? And be positive. That was Henry's idea Hen Henry always never talk and spoke about sin. He tal he spoke I know about the love of God. Exactly and I feel Yes Yeah. Yeah. I think we all feel like this don't we? We want to stress the love that He's changed our lives. Yeah but how can How do you prove it to somebody else if they don't haven't known it ? Don't ask me Matt, I've been sitting talking for many long days No no. It's i i i and and sometimes I think to myself, would I love this person that i'm talking to, to become a believer of Christ? And I say to myself, what a long way they've got to go. Well it's only it's only a er er It's only the the the journey from the mind to the heart. Yeah but it's the growing isn't it? Well no, it's an instantaneous journey for many. Oh I do hope so, cos I've never Yeah. seen it Yeah. really. Yeah. I've never never seen or witnessed that . You would you would say you were a gradual conversion ? Mm. I'm still like it now . Yeah. Yeah. Well I wasn't, I was an instantaneous conversion. Mm. still making slow progress aren't you? Oh yes. But I was an instantaneous conversion. Yes. You're still making? Yes. I think everybody progresses, Yeah. all their lives. We are whether you're to your journey's end suddenly or slowly Yes. Yeah, you are. More so than what you think. Does the lord wind up hill all the way,the very end. I must leave now, don't stop now, please carry on. Well I think it's time to stop now. God bless. it does tend to if you Bye bye Jack, take care Bye bye Jack got your mac on his chair. How do we stop this? Have you done much work? I've done some work. I've tried Good. to sort of Good. what the hell I was supposed to do with . What were you doing ? There's some I'm totally totally confused on . You were doing differentiating and then Yeah. leaving it and then going back to it to see if you could integrate it plus some graphs . Some of it. Yeah. No no I don't know what I've done with the graph. I've been concentrating on trying to Okay. I've gone through these I don't know how many times. Right. I done them and then I've took them down and I've gone back. I've g I've got about a half a dozen sheets of paper scattered all over the place, and I've decided to do it in this cos then I can just go to here. Right. So I've done that. Now I can understand that, understand that. Right. That goes to that, two X, but I'm not sure why. Now is that that cosh squared X ? Yeah. Right. And that is goes to two X. shine squared X. You mean do you mean ? No. It's two X in the book. Yeah. Okay. Now he does make mistakes so that's not a Erm problem. Mm. And then there's That I can understand. But that is actually is not like that. That's X squared but when it's differentiated cos you've gotta go back into the bracket it comes out as that. Right. And that then goes in Okay. that. So I understand that bit. What you're doing I mean you're coming along very well really. But Aren't you? I'm not doing too bad. I think you're doing very well But its like that. I don't get Y to twelve. I mean I know th I know that you carry the sine on because Mm. it goes to sine squared, so you you only differentiate one and according to Okay. that goes to sine squared. Right where your twelve comes from. Well it it must be three times four is equal Right. to twelve. Okay. But it doesn't always go to the front of them. Like here. Yeah. Well The use of the the two X. So I'm not conversant with all the rules. Mm. Okay. Erm how did you differentiate these? I mean are you learning these as they are or I mean No. do them? How are you doing it? No I've I've just All I've done is because Erm because that is a function of that Right. I've differentiated that. Well I didn't differentiate it but I but I did because I couldn't decide . As I as I was talking about for a new pattern . how much you want to write it in there, it's up to you. Just show me how you did that one. Well, all I That one did was that I didn't know whether to do three sine squared right ? Mm. Then differentiate the four X because that's your X value. So that'd be three times the four sine squared. Then to differentiate the whole lot because it goes to cos. Mm. And that is is is not what I get cos what I was doing is doing them meself and then Well what should of be, should of said well if it has to be moved if it's Oh yeah environmental an'all and the council say it's environmental you're likely Well I've a to give it a bit of something to help us to move it well I haven't always but it's a mystery well I haven't always worked here what the, what you the flu? eh? Has it been cold or? Oh aye cold and, ooh round here Oh and me stomach and me chest Oh I've been badly, I have, I've had for three times Yeah wife's had, wife's even poorer, I've been er, I've just finished them antibiotics on er yesterday morning Aye I had eight, eight a day, four of a morning and two other That's a meal innit? Eight a day four, aye, I had two of a morning and I had eight a day I had And no missing Well I wanted to get it ain't up to European standard isn't that no, no, but, no, no oh no it isn't, no No but there wasn't said at the council, they said that they realize that what there has to be done can't be done so, so quickly, you see the past in what er back end of October It's always been a slaughterhouse all my life that, all, all my life there's been one, young girls use them, use some of them food shops round here Yeah all my life there's been a slaughterhouse Yeah all my life that The whole council agreed it should be moved Eh? The whole council agreed it should be moved they all agreed with it er Eleanor said it should be moved But I think it it is Not to be if, if, if they go into the Common Market rate, EE standard or summat it's bloody new job we'd have to be, gotta go to Blackpool this year Well it's engineer that has the, has it all run now Aye it's up to him whether it's, whether they say it's right or wrong I think, I think what the council said is if they, if they want it, the thing shifting, they are strong enough to get it shifted if they, if they, if they really feel that the things rot, you see up in the Dales they, one chap built a house and er, and they said they had to pull it down because it wouldn't fit in with, of No but they, but they told him he'd have to pull it down, so Yeah, but this job's just a bit different innit? I think, I think Just a little bit different Aye Wind is in such a big way and if he goes to the planning appeal and one thing or something, it'll skin this bloody, it'll, it'll skin this bloody town of course it will, we've planned enough, oh yes, certainly, what they doing with, what, what they do with them, them, making them camps and gypsy camps Yeah, yeah what they doing down there? how much it's gonna cost us for an appeal Yeah an appeal goes into a hundred thousand pounds you know Yeah, yeah you know that? Yeah, yeah Oh bloody does that and that's that's not on is it really? Eh? That's not on that really where where do all that money go for the fee? Solicitors and I, I don't know who the hell gets it land up, up there, it took, it took put the bill in, it's next, it's next, we need this next two or three bloody month and I was on about this and I was on about that ev it's possible this is what a lot of them going and getting, you don't want it Habitats, there's enough bloody habitats up and down flowers growing out, I said well I said what's to stop me from taking a bloody plough and ploughing all the bloody flowers up Yeah I said it's my bloody land that it don't matter what I do That's right, yeah oh yeah, yeah, yeah you know but er, there are you get the money and pay for 'em that'll be all the . I thought you know, I did think when they were talking, when the council they were talking about spending a lot of money behind the station Eh? er, thinking of spending a lot of money behind the station and building the supermarket and ploughing it all up, that car park, and then putting the information centre in the old, old I did think you know when I, when we go around and we look at some of these houses like Barratt houses and all like that, I thought that area would of been better off knocking into houses and then you see they would be able to get the community charge of the houses, but as it's gonna happen now the council's gonna have a lot of responsibility one way and another with er they gonna have to they gonna have to pass a lot of land to build houses on to get the bloody rev revenue back in the town Yeah d'ya know that? They are that they are that, because I tell you what it is, I don't know They don't seem to be interested in making money, they seem to be interested in spending it to my mind I could be wrong you know Well it's a weird bloody job this Yeah a weird job altogether a weird job Medieval for your holidays then living in a place like this Eh? Yeah Oh Spain Do ya go there ? Aye, aye me lad has a place at Spain Has he? Oh that's good Aye, aye that's what they've got aye. I like, I like to go down to in Kent Aye well, well we are er, we are, we like this country and Aye we've been to France and we've been to, we've been to er er We might go to France in another four er about I would say spring time Yeah yeah that's right you know I like France do you? Well, we did very much so, we went, actually go, went and stayed with erm, with er a chap that we knew really Aye which made it er very reasonable, very cheap really, we took us car there and that, but he's coming back is this chap now Aye we had bother we've, I, I had a car tyre burst, I had a heck of a job getting one Alright, how's mother-in-law right?

Eh? Like a bit of a flu? Aye, ooh but I'll tell what it was bloody awful, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have another, mind I was only about forty, forty seven, forty five since when he had that Mm in Blackpool, in Blackpool three weeks You're a bit stronger to Eh? counteract it then wouldn't ya? When you're younger you're Oh aye a bit stronger Ooh but you couldn't stay, I was like this for twelve month look Aye pull all your ribs out like that with your cage Yeah oh bloody awful, bloody awful, but, well I should go now Yeah I'm gonna go through Arndale and back home now I've Just been to a friend's house and he's given me a nice cup of tea and a little drop of brandy and that I did enjoy it Oh by Jove, that's I'd enjoyed it nowt, nowt to beat then is there? Tarrah now I'm going Are you going this way? I'm going through Arndale Oh aye,ah Any plans? Well I, obviously want to try and attend meetings if and when possible, er I've been to one last week, which basically was er because I don't feel I'm qualified to get up and David got up and spoke very well actually, he was always, at the police not neighbourhood watch, er to do with the cascade telephone system which we found out afterwards, after a three quarters hour debate a man came up to Dave afterwards and showed him a memo which said this cascade system has now ceased in November nineteen ninety-two and that was the the abuse on that particular meeting. I do intend to er to attend inaugural meetings with each of the C P O s er with a view to looking I mean obviously at some stages you said to me that I would probably have to attend at short notice Mm probably by going to these meetings I can pick up the be best practice for ideas which can be passed on to the others If anybody hears of any neighbourhood watch group meetings, I think make sure Paul knows about it so he can attend where possible Yeah Like him to go and look at the one at er the at er which seems to be a successful one Well I went to the last week and I did say that I'd like to go to that one, I'll go to as many as I can Yeah what I would like and I'm sure it happens with the previous C P O er and I have been notified by telephone and I keep saying to them let me know, but I would like probably a memo from each C P O to say that there is a meeting on this particular night. Do you mean inaugural meetings Well an any meetings really because I think if I can er show my face at these meetings it might er I mean I think whether or not it's because of the increase in burglaries or whether it's because of the publicity via David we seem to have had er a hell of a lot of er enquiries about the schemes. More than normal Tracy ain't it? Yeah I think so Yeah Okay er It's amazing that he's What you saying that for Jed, how long you been saying that for? Yeah I know, but there has ain't there, you know but I say that and I live in an area where there's not a neighbourhood watch scheme and I ain't setting one up to until I retire As crime goes up, people see it as a way of protecting their property don't they Yes seventeen per cent of reported crime is up mm Erm, may I make a comment on neighbourhood watch, I went to er a job the other day, it was a theatre, I was off duty and er I got tapped on the shoulder by my local neighbourhood watch co-ordinator who said, nine months ago I resigned, I wrote a letter to headquarters, I wrote a letter to the divisional commander, and I wrote a letter to the local constable, and nobody's replied to me and they still keep sending me papers are you gonna get your act together, now I I have brought this up before, we never ever have let a neighbourhood watch scheme lapse, it's nothing to do with you, this is all before you came no Er we just kept them on and there's I know quite a few schemes have stopped working but we've still got them written down somewhere probably now we started it might be well worth while g getting rid of some of these schemes that aren't operating Are you saying then that when one's lapsed for six months or over a given period of time we should actually go out there and remove the signs Yeah Well that's one of my next questions because I think it's debatable either way, a a lot of people and I'm finding this just want to be in a neighbourhood watch scheme to take advantage of insurance er and also to have the sign up once the signs are up and they got insurance they're not bothered, and you can tell that by the er gist of the conversation on the telephone. The other the other thing is I've discussed this with C P Os as regards the signs, if a scheme folds then we take the sign down, there are arguments for and against, No No say yeh or nay at the moment No But if the sign's left up surely that's erm deterrent towards crime prevention on the other hand it might make some people realise that if they're no longer a scheme then they don't get the er the Yeah Once a co-ordinator's retired or resigned who do you actually communicate with to find out if the group wants to continue playing Well it should be in the file and I asked for this and keep it before me when a scheme is set up, A we have a map which I must have sent out letters, em I've received very few replies so the signs can be erected and B either a deputy co-ordinator or the deputies that should come in, now some some oblige a lot of them don't Right well let's find one or two of these schemes that appear to have lapsed, send some letters to the names in the file, if we don't get any positive response within a couple of months, let's go and take the signs down er and then wait for the squeals We'll do it ourselves, although the council are the only people who can put them up anyone can take them down, All you need is a pair of wire cutters wire cutters and we'll have them down, have 'em back here, and they won't be wasted, cos although you can't use the straps again we're always short of fronts because of damage cos you can regularly replace the fronts but not the straps Well we can buy straps, or always order some more straps if that's the case Yes It'll also if we start to take action provoke somebody else to take over the schemes, Well that's right At the moment nobody's interested But I think we need to prove that we've actually communicated with quite a few people to say that if we don't hear from you in two months then I'm afraid the scheme will lapse. Is that down to us or should we notify the division to make contact No if if we notify the division after the end of it We can only write to people we know it might well be twenty out of thirty houses wanted Well I think you'll find, but they might be more up to date than Mike Well then, in that case let's send a copy letter to the local station I think so for their information I intend o go through all the files in due course, I mean it's Well It its a big task, em er the thing is that I think that that the first point of call is one is that we get the questionnaire out and see whether you know the one where can we can the questionnaires to all the neighbourhood watch is it,w w we prepare the questionnaire and we get on and send it out, right. Depending on the replies from them in relation to those that have lapsed we then send a second letter to them saying is there anybody that will take over the scheme, if not, right we we intend to remove the signs from the er from the area and then if there is no reply to this letter within fourteen days we you know we'll come and remove the signs. I think there's a lot of them That trawl will bring out a couple of dozen schemes that have totally lapsed, and people will write snotty letters saying I've told you this once before. Mm yeah So great, let's communicate with any other deputies and say if you're not prepared to take it over we'll close the we're afraid the scheme will have to close down. And And remove the signs And any claim and and please inform your insurance companies, And depending on the area we'll give a photocopy of the map and Derek will fetch 'em in, Derek can take them down. Who'll doing No We have that many er applications I mean I've just gone through A division and I've got er a pile of cards literally an inch thick with people a made an initial inquiry or b they've been furnished with questionnaires and not been returned, so I'm sending those er right through the divisions Mm That's the task of the moment, in between the everyday work. Mm, yeah Then of course there's this insurance thing to do as well when David's er free and sorted out Yeah well it's a lot of that Yeah, at least we'll end up with a scheme that's up-to-date and accurate Yeah Well we could also from that by photocopying the er the addresses erm and sending these letters out we might well get updated on the schemes anyway That er a scheme isn't operating What about computerisation of the system to come back to us every twelve months if no contact Eventually, yes. Eventually yes. I think we only want to be on the mainframe so that the divisions can access details in the middle of the night. I think we still have priority at the moment to computers, in effect Paul is going to We might as well I still think we have to have the system as such, perhaps not so intricate, but certainly keep the file probably with the bits in We might, cos you won't be able to put maps and things on them Eh But certainly the main co-ordinators er Almost like the burglar alarm you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because No that'd be a mammoth task If you have somebody like somewhere like that I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them Yes I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them Well, this is something I've just done myself Yeah but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I Yeah think about it, but I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you? No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it So you know who they are, yeah Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm out and then they just go through the system And you also get sometimes two people off the same street Well that's it It's just a reference they want you Mr Smith two doors away Well I've had one for Basingfield or Basingfield Oh I spoke to her, yeah yeah, I've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread and that's a You know for the er village Well have you spoken to Sergeant to alleviate all the paperwork, and yeah yeah and incur any additional expense Three three farms and there's only te ten properties altogether in about two hundred yards But they're building some more aren't they, building another seven Building some, yeah building some massive houses there and a Happy Eater as well Well that's it Do they include that in the scheme, some of them on the rate, I won't bother with that anyway it's not our problem yeah Okay anybody I've got one I meant to put on the main agenda and I forgot, and I wrote the agenda . I've been offered the opportunity by er Bob in training er in force have taken this on er the tactical unit have taken it on, the chance of er one day erm assessment or appraisal training, at erm probably at Exeter for those of us that do it and erm I think that perhaps with the the way that the diverse way that our staff's spread out the proper ways of assessing people which I've I've never been shown how to do and I don't think many of us have. Erm I mean he it sort of went through our staff inspector wise and er Paul was sort of chatting, and he wasn't being unkind he said yes, they'll be dinosaurs because it's a long time since you've had er any training like that. What about civilian staff, I have to assess my staff, I haven't had no training. yeah, yeah right, yeah I also said that erm my I expressed that the fears that I expressed at this meeting last time about er the fact that Paul and I now supervise civilian staff, er which I've never been sat down and told what the civilians term of contract are and what I can or cannot say or whatever, so erm I feel it will be quite valuable, and brought it for me to see if anybody think it's worthwhile pursuing. A one day appraisal Yes, it's a one day, Just write it on a memo form Paul and send it round with a circulation slip, and those who feel they want to get involved put their name down, probably the quickest way of doing it. Right, things are on hold though with assessments aren't they at the moment, cos they aren't they always don't they change every ten minutes I ain't got time to do assessments let alone a one day course. Yeah, that's true. I think that your two waiting for signature on his desk, You haven't seen mine have you, Well why do you want one, you've just bloody had one No it's Derek First time he's said anything nice about me, I thought I'll get in while I can Derek, it won't last Right, anyone else want to bring any points up Took me, took me about bloody two days to do your last one Stuart is having a social event on the eleventh of March for the media and the police, I'll circulate this round with a er slip on it, erm it involves a conducted tour of the police station and some bits and bobs oooh And everyone's very welcome to come, I'll let you know reply to it Eleventh of March Well it's now come under a general invited round to us all Yeah Eleventh of March, yeah The on the contacts slip so you can read at your leisure, anybody else want to raise any points, Tracy at all, David About car park Green vans, green vans green vans Are we I'm gonna tell it don't start No, I've been and spoken to them again this morning and yesterday, R S C left it there not O S D although it's O S D's van, so they should've come out to move it on Friday and the mechanics didn't turn up, then they lost the keys, cos yesterday myself and who was it, Lyn, waited up for the keys cos they were gonna move down put it into a safer spot. mm Couldn't find the keys anywhere Well they were hung up on the board in O S D on Friday when I went down there Which which office? In the a in the No, you know you know as you're going down the corridor before you get to the doors to go down the next set of stairs, I mean in O S D, the last one is er for the P C that does all the man er you know all the duties and things like that, and in his office there's a great big board with all the vehicles on, and the key's hung up at the end and who's got 'em out, and the bottom one is that green van, because he went up and picked 'em up, when I was there. I was coming to David tomorrow morning if it's still there yeah yeah We're not gonna put any down cos it's going somewhere else But they're gonna have to find him Erm Bob Bob No no no You have to wait until all the transit vans are out and double parked put it across across the transit van bays So nobody can get in at all Mm, or their transits Let's throw the keys away I was saying to David this morning there was a on the police that was good probably terribly naive oh it says something like J R Green a number which doesn't exist and any tradesperson could have the name address type of trade and a real phone number course they would yeah You could change the signs quite regular though couldn't you Painter and decorator one day and er butcher the other Quite easily throw, throw some paint over the back and everything paint running out the back Mm yeah detail like that Hear that rubbish really, not our problem, anybody else want to bring any points up No no We've got dates for the meeting, I've got two suggestions, one is that I can't see any point anymore why here here and it's to one yeah, here here better headquarters, yeah, where where S thirty one, if we book it in advance we can get in S thirty one downstairs in the canteen, cos we're only an hour and half, two hours meeting yeah We can be finished by quarter to twelve Good idea, any items of agenda for Sergeant , who will be organising the next meeting in S thirty one Okay yeah fine twenty eighth of March Hang on He's on holiday bloody right The meetings coming for comments like that There's an S L O's meeting on the twenty eighth of March Oh good I'm in Majorca Are we gonna do dates now or I think we regard the deputies visit as a special visit and Mm yeah I mean I think the thing to do I mean we most of our lot are within the corridor, what we need to do is get headquarters find out when the rooms free and ring everybody round Can you organise that Yeah I'll find it Yeah, if you go up to that door Yeah well fifteenth March what day is it Tuesday? There there's some dates on there No fifteenth of March is out. Silly bugger Wednesday it's a Tuesday Fifteenth of March twenty second of March It's much easier with a cal diary Okay for that one What twenty second of March, is that too far ahead? Right twenty second if there's any difficulty I'll come back to Paul and Keith cos to let everybody else know about any problems S thirty one is it Well yes S thirty one Well Do you think it's Do you not think it's worthwhile booking the rest of the year's meetings or shall we do it as we carry on What you mean going to find a room I'm bored now Are we closing the meetings Yeah we're all bored The meeting's closing just before ten thirty thank you. The sun has now risen the sun is over the yard arm. This is oral history project tape number two of Mr Melville , of eleven, Close, Ipswich in Suffolk. My name is Joyce , the date is the twentieth of August, nineteen eighty seven. This is interview number six of the Fire Brigade. So you put another story on at Road? Yes, so that became the the fire prevention suite, erm and erm still is the fire prevention suite, erm and is well used now again, almost bursting, I should think er with increasing staff and, and work which seems to come each year. When you talk about f fire prevention, what do you actually mean? Yep, well, I mean the objective of fire prevention is to, is to try and make places safer and to alert people to erm to the risks and dangers of fire, before it happens,that that's, the objective is to er try and stop fires happening. Some of it is done by legislation which erm fire officers have to erm put to use er and, and work to erm and then there's a lot of good will advice and, and help that can be given, er and publicity and training and so on which comes under the big wing of fire prevention. I think they call it fire safety now, in my time it was fire prevention but now fire safety which is probably a better word for it. Er so, that task, much of it under legislation, is carried out by fire officers and much of it as I say by good will and erm er advice to householders and bodies and erm big concerns and so on. Does that mean visiting their premises? Yep, yep erm these officers are all trained in, in fire prevention work erm at the Fire Service's technical college at Morton Marsh, and er they practise those skills they learn there over many years erm I'm looking back, I mean the time that I spent in training schools and er and in, in the job er I suppose when you total it all up it must be two or three years away from home really, er in courses you know, in my day we went away on fire prevention training classes six months, six months' course was the, so you went away to the Fire Service college which in those days was at Dorking, a lovely place in Dorking, and you did six months there solid, and then nowadays about thirteen weeks, the courses run about thirteen weeks, and you are constantly fire, fire officers from the ranks of erm probably a Sub Officer, leading fireman in some places, but Sub Officer onwards and particularly Station Officer up to the more senior ranks are away on courses regularly for, it's really updating people erm new legislation coming in, new techniques coming in, erm which have to be these people have to be updated so they are very well trained, erm more so than most local authority people I would think, fire, fire officers are, erm purely because the job is such a wide range of, of things to deal with. That's changed over the years hasn't it? Oh it's changed no end erm particularly the fire safety and firing, fire prevention angle has changed erm the operational side has changed in as much the things are more complicated nowadays buildings are more complicated erm fire losses are greater erm Fire losses? You know as the result of a fire the, the amount of money and goods that er are destroyed in the fire erm chemicals erm have come on the scene which bring with it their own particular dangers and risks from fire and from erm from the toxic effects of chemicals and the endanger to the environment. Was this a new area for you when you came to Suffolk because we have the docks close by, chemicals coming in there and at Felixstowe, Yep. this is an area probably that was new to you? It was erm it's the first time that I'd come across, I mean I'd been a little bit of experience on, on inland waterways in Windsor er which I'd lost when I went to Leicester and Lincoln I came back here of course and now we had the North Sea and the docks and erm that was a new area and a, and a really good challenge erm I particularly got involved with, with things like erm the movement of chemicals which was beginning to increase and coming into Felixstowe and, and er and, and er Ipswich erm and when I think back Felixstowe Dock, looking back, ended where the big jumbo tank, the Calor Gas tank is, that, that was the sort of range of Felixstowe Dock in those days. Look at it now, it's gone right the way back now, with all that land being reclaimed and warehousing and you name it and docks, new docks, so in the past ten years, what a massive development that has become. They wanted to come back even further didn't they? They did. Recently. Yes, they did, but that's a massive development, and with it, of course, the new motorways, you know the, the A forty five, and the A twelve and, and all the new by-passes, the traffic now that er is on the roads there, of all kinds, erm is no one 's business, plus the warehousing arrangements at Felixstowe and, and Ipswich. So, it's a busy area now and erm from a fire point of view the fire risk is, is quite, quite high now, I would've thought, not necessarily dangerously high, but certainly it's increased, gradually increased. So, erm I saw the change. Did you have any, did you have any large scares with chemicals? Yes. In your early days. Well, yeah er we we had a fair amount of chemical er troubles erm mainly spillages, bad packaging, erm a few accidents erm, and very little information in those early days erm there was a lot of nasty chemicals going around which erm very little information followed it and people were being quite seriously injured, firemen included, policemen and others were getting involved with these things, and I got myself involved quite a lot with the various bodies that deal with chemicals, like the Chemical Industry Association, and people of that kind, trying to make things a bit safer, and taking up cases where spillages had occurred and, and accidents had happened er to try to get to the bottom of it and try to improve the situation and er I wasn't alone, most Chief Officers were working that way and certainly the London Fire Brigade did it, did no end of work with producing, what is now commonly known as the coding and, and a system of, of erm er marking containers of chemicals so that people can understand how to deal with them, so that that was quite an interesting area which, even now I'm now retired I still have a little hand in that with er chemicals er in my few moments I have spare I, I get involved with that side, which I enjoy. Erm that is an area where, that and road traffic accidents which has grown considerably in, in the time that I've been in the service in more recent years, which has become more sophisticated, the equipment has become more sophisticated, the techniques have had to be developed to deal with them and firemen are becoming more expert in, in handling these er er situations with, with equipment er which is much more technical, and, and er How has it changed? Well the, the risk has changed for a start I mean with the chemicals there are so many now erm chemicals and so much of it being transported by road, the risk of that and the dangers of accidents must be increased, although legislation has brought in a number of improvements, so firemen have to be very much up to date with that. Do they have special gear for chemicals? Yes they have, very special gear in, in breathing apparatus and protective clothing, er which I didn't have in my early days, I mean breathing apparatus was just beginning to be used. We're talking about Road are we? Yep, now nowadays erm they've got the best, I mean the equipment is excellent, er it came in my time erm my predecessor's time and it's been carried on now and new developments have come in, erm and with, of course techniques in, not only dealing with the chemicals in, in making safe afterwards which is twice as complicated I think, you know the decontamination side, the clearing up, the protecting of the environment from toxic chemicals er which we've all heard about in newspapers, and read reports and seen it on television, these, these accidents up and down the world. How do you stop it getting into the environment, because if you hose it down it will wash down into the drains won't it? Very dan very difficult you've got to take steps of blocking off drains and stopping it getting in the waterways and you, you succeed sometimes, you don't success on other times and this is why er these accidents happen where all the fish and places die and people get contaminated, cattle get contaminated, all sorts of things. We're very conscious of that erm and where, where we offered advice in large places where for instance, where housing where chemicals are stored and all the precautions that are needed are provided and built in, for instance stopping off the drains so that water is contained, providing sloping areas in, in the bottom of warehouses where water doesn't come out, erm monitoring it telling people about it. You almost need to be an architect. Well, fire officer's training does take in a lot of architectural work, you know the safety of buildings and the way in which they're put up, the materials that are used, the strength and the strength of materials and the fire resistance of materials, all that comes into their work. So, it's the range of of knowledge is quite wide, you know, from, from extricating a cat and how to do that er to, to a large modern hotel building, how to protect it from fire, so, so there's quite a lot to learn yep. This is why that the leaning process never ends, it's, it's always on, the new developments come in and people have to be taught, and firemen have to keep up to date with that. For anybody who's interested it's certainly not a boring . I never found it to be a boring job, erm if it is boring I think it's because they're only making it, if they make it that way and I think it's partly due, if they, if people do talk that way then I think it's partly due to the sort of duty systems that people work now, and erm the number of hours they work, and, and strangely for little things like the introduction of television, I think television, very nice in its way but it's killed life on fire stations and in certain areas, cos the whole business of conversation and learning and so on has gone, people would much sooner sit nowadays in front of the television and be entertained for an evening, instead of using all the other skills and, and erm things that are offered to them. Do the firemen at Road still live on site when they're on duty? Yes, oh yes, nobody leaves a fire station once they come on duty no. But, instead of playing cards and talking and making their own enjoyment probably? I might be a bit biased, I think they still do that but I think erm The television has the television has made a difference. I think not only just at fire stations, I think in the whole of life, hasn't it? Yes. Er, home life has changed, I think, because of that. I'm not saying it's bad, necessarily bad, but I think it has changed something and, and it's, I, I certainly saw it when it came onto fire stations in the fifties how life changed in the fire station. And er now it's accepted I suppose and young firemen joining now wouldn't, wouldn't know any different, and they'll probably be able to manage much better than I would on a fire station. Er I often ask what's life like, and the funny thing I've got a son in it now, I've got a son who's a station officer in, in Colchester, and my daughter just married a fireman from, from Road so, so we're still involved Keep it in the family we're still involved, and they tell me that life on a fire station is still very pleasant so I'm sure it must be. When you were talking about the equipment changing for road traffic accidents, in what way has that changed? Well, first of all er we started off with having a, an amount of fire equipment, an amount of rescue equipment carried on a particular vehicle. And what did you have? Er things like er crowbars and bull croppers and er rescue ropes and lines and things of that kind, which are very very simple, stuff you would buy in a hardware shop and probably be able to manage with it. Now things became so complicated that one of the things we did and I think I was partly instrumental in it, was to make sure that we carried this on all fire engines, you know we used to have this one at each divisional headquarters, probably forty miles away. So, in the process of er change we, we provided the basic means for cutting, lifting and pulling er on every fire engine, a little amount of, of equipment, so that if you had a road traffic accident you didn't, the machine that was there, now that was a great step forward. Er we also had one very large, cumbersome machine which carried things like lighting and breathing apparatus, and heavy lifting gear and all the other bits and pieces of rescue equipment, which came along in slow time, now that has been improved upon no end, and they've got a very modern equipment now for that, erm er modern in the sense that new, new pieces have come on, cutting equipment with hydraulic jaws which er just slice through the top of a car roof, whereas we had to cut it with a hacksaw perhaps, or, or another metal saw, we, these can be done with just like cutting through cheese. And time is the essence isn't it? Oh yes In an accident oh yes, and, and er it's amazing those few seconds, how much they can relieve pain and suffering, if you can get people out quickly and, and take away the, the trouble from them. Could it So that's all progress. could a fireman administer first aid? Yes, they're all trained in first aid, erm erm and in the use er we also carry the analgesic gas, now the ones that er nitric oxide which is used in er pregnant mothers for childbirth, they carry some of that now, er which they administer to people in pain and that takes away the pain erm for the time being anyway, until such time as you can extricate them or, or ease the pain or take away the problem away from them that's causing them the pain. So that's a great step forward, isn't it, to, to relieve pain as quickly as that. When did that come about? Oh nineteen sixties we, we introduced that with the blessing of the ambulance people as well, it wasn't done without careful consideration, because erm we didn't want people to, to just erm introduce it without knowing what we were doing and ever since we used it it's been a great blessing. So that's another step forward. Is this equipment carried on a normal fire tender? Erm certainly on the rescue tenders, erm erm on, on each division would have that equipment, it's not carried on every fire engine as far as I know now, erm I, I don't see why it shouldn't but er again I think it's a matter of cost, and, and carrying it about as well and finding the space for it, but certainly it's at hand when it's needed. So, so that's been a great improvement I think, erm in recent years and, and in the erm early seventies we, we also went into the business of providing equipment that could be left at rescues, on site, you know it was always tying up a fire engine by taking it there and, and being tied up so we provided these things which we call demountable equipment, which we commonly call the pods and erm Why did you call them pods? I don't know where the name came from it, it, it's, it's, it's simple and it seemed to work erm Was it local? all it was was a box really, a box which you could get off a, a, a machine and dump it on the ground, erm the idea came from, from er I think dustcarts really, where, where you could sort of tip them up and, and they'd empty, and that, that was this early thought on it er Was it hydraulically taken up? All hydraulically lifted yep With an arm yep, and we developed theo that business here in fact in Suffolk, we were the very first Fire Brigade to, to do it in the seventies, er our own workshops made them erm the units and are now still making them, and the ideas were original ideas on, on, on the equipment and we made about three or four in, in when I retired and I think they made several others now like canteen vans, and erm breathing apparatus, er and so on. So there's a whole range now which requires just one prime mover to lift these pods and deposit them where they're needed, and it's been done in Germany elsewhere, in Fire Brigades elsewhere, certainly in Germany because I went and saw them there as well, and it's a very simple straightforward progressive sort of way of dealing with problems of the Fire Service. Is it a normal fire tender that takes this pod along? No, it, it's, it, it, it's coloured like a fire, fire, fire engine red and all the other things, but it, it's a commercial vehicle a roll-on roll-off type of vehicle, which you can buy commercially and, and adapt for Fire Service use, and there's erm I should think there must be about half a dozen pods now, erm at High Wootton, in fact police services are using it, Thames Valley Police I remember coming up here to, to take the idea back, erm I saw yesterday at Hungerford, er the police there going with their pods to, to More like a cabin? It, it is it's, it's, you design it and you fit it up, and you can just Pentiford Drop it down, in this Pentiford yep, ours is filled with all sorts of gear, for instance decontamination, you know erm after a, a chemical incidence you've got to clean yourself off without contaminating everybody else, and you can do this within a pod, it's been so designed that you can walk in one way dirty, and walk out another way clean, and And how do you clean up in there then? Well there's water provided, there's showers provided, there's, there's clean air is provided, there's dirty areas and it was all well planned and segregated and, and partitioned off and curtained off and so on and, and it does work. What happens to the water then ? It's all collected into, into plastic er cans and you don't use gallons of it, you, you used enough to clean yourself off, and that's collected and then disposed of er under advice and help from the disposal, waste disposal people. The idea is that you don't dispose of it in the drains where it can contaminate. So that's been another step forward I think, in the whole progression, of the Fire Service. What other changes have you seen over the, with the Fire Service at Road, since Road well you came? I think communications has been the biggest change that I saw, erm er from a system which was called the DX system, which is really a very primitive way of calling people by means of generating electric current over some private wires, to fireman's houses and on to fire station. How does it generate? It's generated with a handle and Wound round? Yes, wind them round and this should, should generate a charge which rang bells and sounded bells and then er you lift up a telephone and plug in a jack and, and take a message in that way. Erm in fact telephones, I mean talking back to nineteen forties and fifties, very few people had telephones, and it wasn't uncommon in, in those days on fire engines, where, I know at Salisbury we did this, we took a bike and put it on the back of a fire engine, and if you were the youngest you were told, send the stock message back, or the informative message back, and find the telephone, and you pedalled and find the telephone, and, and you'd get told off when you came back, why you weren't quicker about taking it. Now that was the system. It seems incredible, doesn't it, but like it was the only practical way to do it wasn't it? That's right, I mean you, you looked in, in, in, if you had a fire out in the sticks somewhere, you'd look to see where the telephone was, where if there were any, and then knock on somebody's door perhaps, at two o'clock in the morning and say can I use your telephone, and they weren't very happy sometimes I can tell you. Weren't they? Oh, no and er Hasn't anyone ever come unstuck? Well,the you've heard, I've heard some people being nasty and, and they didn't say no, but it was always, not always it was occasionally done grudgingly, and, and erm in many cases of course it was done willingly, you know come in yes please do, and, and they didn't even want the penny that, that you offered them for the telephone call. Heavy phone call. In the days, in those days yes, but nowadays what is it, it's er such a fantastic erm step forward really, it's all on radio, er where at the press of a button you get radio contact between headquarters and any fire engine, between any officer in the fire engine, you can call firemen by radio at their house, and at the fire station, erm I mean this is, is, is really progress and erm might be complicated, I'm sure it has its problems as well, but for a matter of speed er and computers as well coming in with it, the whole thing now is, is very sophisticated and erm very modern, and I think that's probably been the, probably the biggest step forward here. We started it off in, in nineteen seventy, early seventies with an all radio system, and we were the only Fire Brigade in the country that started it off, called the multi-tone radio system of communications. Er much to everybody's fear, really, because we, we, we were stepping into a new area, you can imagine from, from wires to something with no wires, and the risk of that failing, but, but it worked and er from thereon, of course most Fire Brigades have taken on the task and, and er are now on radio contact of this kind. So Suffolk was the prime area? Oh, no doubt about it, in nineteen seventy two, seventy one seventy two we, we went out on a limb really with that, erm when all other Fire Brigades were using telephone systems, the Suffolk and Ipswich Fire Service went out and did that. So that I think has been the biggest, communication-wise, has been the biggest step forward in a more erm friendly and er happier sort of note we, we were one of the few brigades that started a band. Erm there was the London Fire Brigade which had a band, erm and the Yorkshire Fire Brigade which had a band, but there was no brass band as such in this part of the world. When did it start? It started nineteen seventy one or seventy two, it must have been, when my predecessor and I were sat down, and we said what about a band, they all said, what band, well let's have a band, and and it started just like that, and we, we managed to get the whole of the brigade alerted to it, and we had a meeting at headquarters, to which about forty or fifty people turned up, of which two had probably blown a an instrument in the past, and there was enough enthusiasm to learn and we had a, a chap who was a musical teacher in town who was would happily teach our people you see and so we went out, we had a penny, with no help from the authority or anybody else and we got every type of brass instrument for a band on tick and we said we'd pay for it, and er As the Fire Brigade or individually? Er well, not as a Fire Brigade as, as, as individuals I suppose, we, we took the risk of, of paying for these instruments and On the strength of a Fire Brigade band? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and they did, they sent us a whole vanload of, of instruments and I can remember the, the evening we, we put all these instruments in the conference room there and the gang of enthusiasts arrived and, and they said and what would you like to play? Some said they'd, they'd be interested in playing, they knew how to play certain things and others wanted to play others and that's how we started, and in a matter of a year the new headquarters at er Lowestoft was being opened, by the Dutchess of Kent, and we decided that the band was going to play at that one and you can imagine, and it was all ready and they were playing music, but I'm not sure what, what quality music it was, and blow me on the week before, the band leader, the conductor decided he couldn't play because he had a sprained wrist so we were left without a conductor even, but we managed to get another conductor and we played and I don't know what it sounded like, but the Dutchess of Kent was very kind, she said the music sounded lovely. God bless her. And things have gone on since then and the band still plays, er they have not the easiest task of finding people, because of change and so on, but er their families and friends and, and even some of the youngsters that learn at school that, a fireman's friends and relatives have joined the band and they play out in the parks and they, and they play in the spar pavilion and they, they provide concerts for people, and Christmas times they play in the town. That's lovely. And I think it's great, and it's uniformed and it's played at the opening of, of the Fire Service technical college at Morton March, it was invited to play there with the other bands and erm before the Queen, and er so it's, it's gone on, from strength to strength and we are very proud of it, we really are. When you said uniforms, it that fire uniforms? Fire uniform band, yep And children in there? How do they get Then we get it specially made. locally? Yeah, we're talking about children who you know thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, which are growing up a bit, but we get them altered and we get them made for them, we used to get them made and er still do I think. Do you get them made locally? Yep, yeah all the mothers are very good as well, they, they, they alter them and get the uniform altered and fit so they look very smart they really do with er with the standard uniform with a little bit of embellishment on the shoulders and so on but erm otherwise it's the standard uniform. When you say standard uniform, that is a variant from another type of uniform? It's the, it's the what we would call the walking-out uniform, you know the, the undressed uniform, not the fire fighting uniform, which is really just a jacket and trousers and shirt and tie and, and the girls have a skirt and er er a tie and blouse and that sort of thing, so and a cap of course. Girls. Yes, we've got girls in the band as well, you know relatives of the families and, and girls that are work will do work in the Fire Brigade, in the control room and so on . Have there ever been any fire ladies, you've got firemen? Erm, they haven't had them in Suffolk, we've had one or two try to join and one did reasonably well, but right at the end of, of the, of one of the tests, the strength tests, she failed, she couldn't quite manage it erm What would she have to do? Er, well you have to carry a twelve stone man over a hundred yards, you see, in a certain time, and that is one of the strength tests, erm er these are these are tests that are drawn up to get people in in the initial stages, and then they go on from there. Erm and she was from the Pentiford area I think, erm oh quite a well educated girl, erm there was nothing to stop them from joining, I mean the London Fire Brigade there are, are fire fighters who are girls, erm and the er they do very well erm there are problems of course, with, with women on fire stations, but nevertheless there's no reason why they shouldn't be there, providing said I've got two this afternoon and two tomorrow morning. And each time I've ask you what have you got today, right. Now remember they're not they can't be counted as your boss Your boss no. they're just the person there That's right yeah. who they just need to know on a daily basis what deals you've got. So that they can see how you're progressing. And it's not big brother certainly not a big brother attitude it's just they're there to help you. And er he said, Well you haven't listened to me have you. He said you're making appointment still to go and talk about advertising. He said what reasons have they told you that they're bowing out? Well erm they didn't want to do banker's order, so why did you go around? You're wasting your time and your petrol because it's my petrol That's right. and my car. The second week was entirely different. I I did it their way Mm. and I'll show you one of the commission sheets. It started to pour in and it was compared with previous. You know it does pour in if you have nought the week before anything you get is pouring in. But it was a very good week after that. That's why I always persuade people they must listen. If they listen they'll love you if you listen I'll tell you because you'll do it. Yeah. And all of your performance all the performance of the sales consultants determines what other people are earning themselves. So it's to their interest to beef you up. Having got the fact that I believe you can slot into this job Robert. Because we do give a training course we don't send you know, are you happy to consider that that that there's a two-way opportunity? Oh there's gotta be yeah. Okay. That helps to actually get that out of the way. The referees you were looking for you Well I I yeah the only point is there that we do require four referees. Now if you're you're you're obviously that will not tell us very much about your selling. No The other people all have not aye? They're all not there now. They're not oh that sometimes presents a problem but quite honestly er if you've if you've still got some contacts in sales we're you know. Nobody puts references down here if they've got any sense that are gonna give bad references. Yeah well I mean As as a personnel manager once said to me, Reference are only worth the amount of work You know I you've done on them. I can put down a school teacher does that help? Yeah fine yeah put it under that. Yeah. It's my next door neighbour. School teacher yeah anybody ? Next door neighbour. The references I've given, well I haven't had to give many over the years. But it's been two next door neighbours, one a bank manager and one a chief executive of a company. Mhm. This is fir this is the first My accountant no problem. The first, well my wife done all my books you see. In the company you know I've never dealt with any All I can say is I'm going to put down here, to be advised. Because we're very the reason Right okay. All right. But please advise because we we will write to you. The reason for that is that we're putting tot total strangers on to our clients premises for three weeks. Yeah. And we've already discovered in the last six months by discreet calls because of something we've seen a bit funny in er er in er references that have come back or people have been down right honest and said, Sorry er this guy was last time I spoke with him. He put a solicitor down, and last time I spoke with him I was defending him on a for fraud . . We had he's already started an assignment. We had to pull him off. We couldn't afford to have that guy in. Yeah you know I I yeah I can see. See that? Yeah. Because they'd want your office where you phone I I'm going with it. So so please please take take it seriously on that. Yeah. Please please help me out on that one. Yeah. All right. Robert that's one hurdle out of the way. I believe you could do this job. You cos you I think you you you've got pride and you've got determination and you've got some pzazz. If I'm if I I am in luxurious position of saying that I can fit you in to some of these companies. I've got six companies there. If you were to choose an environment that you think you might be happy to work within, cos remember you're selling ads whichever one, Mm. where do you think you'd put yourself? You've got schools golf clubs uni erm schools universities colleges er estate agents two products and medical areas two products. Well it would have to be I wou looking at it it would be between two wouldn't it really? Estate agents cos they're all over the country. Aha. And golf clubs cos I play golf and they're all over the country . Yeah. Now they're I I personal and er I'm going to tell that with your I don't know any with your background in sales and in what you've done er with your hands as well, I would put you in estate agents. Mm. I I think you'd be er you'd succeed a lot more in that. I know you play golf it might be a danger putting you on the golf courses. You'd want to play the damn thing all the time . with me. I'm just turned forty and I . Okay? Yeah. I but we've got two products there. We've got two products there postal wallets and folders. Quite honestly I have no particular erm preference there for you except let's have a look at the two products shall we? Yep. This is what it's all about products. And they each do for the home buyer and the estate agent the same sort of thing. It presents there the home buyer with a list of businesses that er er that's er an estate agents newspaper that we print er publish every, er it is over here, every month. So we have two products, let me show you these. Okay. These are given away to house buyers when they or prospective house buyers when they walk through the door. Right. All right? Er difference er is obvious. These are much more erm you know retend er retention. There's all the information. Doesn't matter what estate agent you may be going into you will keep the information in this if the other esta other estate agent hasn't got it. Yeah. So you're more, first of all the estate agent's name will be in front of you more than the others, and also the advertisers will be. Right. So an estate agent who hasn't got one of these when you go into this one erm you're likely to retain this. It also has we have the largest independent producers of street maps in the country. And I believe them to be the some of the nicest maps I've ever seen. But we don't sell them. No they're Given away. Given away. That's why er people who come to our company and then after a year or so think they can go away and do this on their own, can't do it. They try they fail they're they're Mhm. another twenty years it's littered with people who've failed in this. Yeah. And that's because of the map. A lot to do with the map. So there's that product and the earning potentials are the same on on both of these products. And then there is what what is a what is a spin-off from the other is a postal wallet. The the estate agents were finding that they were using these up very quickly by sending them away, also they were rather expensive to send away in the post and we were not prepared to put, er we weren't getting the income to survive on that. So we said what can we produce that they can send through the post. And we produced this. Four er six years ago I think it was. The difference the difference the obvious difference perceptively between that and that is er the size but also the number we will print. We will print three thousand of these may be per year Yeah. We'll print thirty five thousand of these. The difference the benefit to this er the advertising here is that it's going to be repeat. If you're on the mailing list you're gonna get a lot of these. Yeah. If you walk through the door you're gonna get one of those. But the benefit of that is it's retained. The benefit of this is repeat. Yeah. And then of course they'll always retain the one that appeals. I'll keep this cos I need to keep that guy's . Yeah. So the the crux of the job is right if I've picked all right. Yeah okay. You go to an estate agents Remember you don't have This is this is You're selling this not this . You're selling this. That that's that's what I was gonna get at . That's . Yeah. Right. We've taken we've taken er some of the workload off. Yep. And you phone round local builders local whatever Right. er and ask if they'd like to advertise. Well I'll give you an idea. Yeah. That list when marketing group go round to sign up the estate agent for one or the other or both. Yeah. Obviously they're not sold together. This might be sold another six or seven months after that Yeah. or vice versa. Yeah. They can have both but not together. Erm they are left er a list of er a blank like this and say right you contracted to take the products now we want from, it'll be this one say, now we want a list of advertisers who or prospec prospect businesses who you think you're happy for us to approach for a start. In other words you don't mind your name his name associated with you. Yeah that's right credibility Secondly. Credibility. Yeah. Erm and it'll also help us to get the the out of your way, we'll get out of your hair within five or six days if you give us all the businesses. Yeah. Now these represent, and this list is sent back to us and retained on the with the contract and all the details of this assignment for when it comes to the top of the pile as it were. Right. When it comes to the top of the pile whoever is the most geographically suitable and available, the consultant is told there's there's your new assignment. Just coming up to finishing this one here here's your new one. That list is sent in the er assignment pack to the estate agent to wait for your arrival. Right. I think I told you this by the way, this I want to describe to you now is the same for all of them. All of them yep. And in fact we even er I'm not sure whether this is still in operation, but we even give them an idea of the categories. Now I can Yeah. I can say to you right now with confidence that if I'd asked you to start writing er a list of the categories that people er that you think might advertise in these you'd probably get about twenty five. Yeah. We've got about a hundred and fifty . Fifty. That's just a Yeah. that's just a slip. Because one of the worse things you can do in this and it's a it's a it's something everybody does I think, I understand anyway, is to prejudge who will or who will not advertise in Yeah. As far as I'm concerned anybody who wants to sign a contract with me gives me copy and a cheque is a legitimate. Mhm. And yet I've been as guilty as anybody else in saying, Oh they won't wanna come in this medical practice booklet what will they gain from it? Let them decide. That's right. We know what they will from advertising their business. That's waiting for you when the assignment comes up. The important thing about that Bob is not to accept it just at face value. Is to sit down with the estate agent and say, Right why have you got these business on. Tell me a little bit about each one of them. And then they say, Well the guy he's next door I don't know him but I just thought I'd put him on. That's not enough for you to pitch on. Yeah. You say well look I'm gonna approach this guy what sort of business are you gonna put his way or can you put his way. Mhm. Is it in your power to put a newsagent er any business. He'll say, Well I can make sure all the newspapers all the erm come in here. And I'll say fine. I've gotta be able to tell him that. Yeah. And you'll have to know your local reputation as well. Absolutely. Well they would know that. But you would only approach that business on the basis that well the estate agent has asked me to give you er you know he he feels that you would benefit and erm from this exposure and er has asked me to approach you first. May be the third one you've approached that day. But they will tell you on the phone . It's Okay? It's that sort of pitch. Okay. Okay? Now So there's not really cold call well it's cold Oh calling in a way but you've got It's not as you want Yeah. Rob er Robert but but we really have warmed it up as much as we can. The the lists that we get range from mediocre to pretty good to excellent. Yeah. But even the mediocre ones you know you have to say, Come on chaps there must be more businesses in this. And of course we've been doing these for twenty years, folders. We've been doing these for about six. The majority of our assignment I would think now are getting to the resale position. In other words we're going back after three or four years. So we'll have repeats. So when you go in and say I'm coming to resell er tell me first of all here's the old here's the current erm folder or postal wallet, who are these people are they still in existence. What sort of business have you, before I approach them, have they do you think they've gained anything from you. What relationship have you got with these. Because if you phone these guys up and say, What a waste of time. Not get anything from them. You may have to say, Well I've just been talking to the estate agent about this and er you know on a number occasions he's sent people along to you er may be you didn't realize that was happening. Mm. Because they don't ask everybody who comes through. Oh when did you hear about this? Yeah. All they want is Small businesses now don't anyway do they ? So we emphasize that when we're signing them up make sure you ask when these people come through where they have seen or where how did they find out about us. I'd be interested I would. Mhm. Yeah. So there's all that on the table. So that's that product. I won't go into the er the earnings yet because they're exactly the same as this. Yeah. That's a fol you can take that away that explains er what what and this is the this is the folder all right? Now you'll see that there are almost the same number of slots in in each. Okay now we've had this for twenty years so a lot of these have been resold of course. But we've got a lot of new ones. Asda for instance if you know the supermarket chain er now have er property services on their prem premises. We've just got the contract to do them. Yeah? So how do you feel about these? Same pitch slightly different pitch of course er sorry slight difference is that you're saying that these of course will be handed out to a targeted Out to audience. These of course are repetitive. Yeah. Are these like erm mail shotted through somebody whose registered with the estate agent? Yes for instance if I Or is it only to buyers? No. If if if if you were wanting to buy erm buy a house if you were moving house, and I didn't realize until the other day that ninety percent of people who buy and sell houses are moving within their own area. Yeah. That's surprised me. Erm er you know if fact they could be just moving two streets away or five miles away but all within the same town. Erm those are the people that are unlikely to get these. Because they Yeah. But I received my first one of these from er from Lloyds er Black Knights er services because I was in I was about fifteen miles away. I could still have easily called in if I'd wanted to but I saw something advertised in a village saw the board took the number down and phoned them up. So they sent me it. Erm because I didn't find it convenient to go and call. That's the sort of so. But you could be three or four hundred miles away moving from Penzance to Aberdeen. That's when you're likely to get that. You'll still visit the area and get one of those. But in the first instance you'll get these. Because that's the quickest way they can get stuff to you. Yeah. And I suppose may be it's may be if somebody got that, that's why I say if you have to buy the property first. But if you got it you might find it would be cheaper to do your house up using these clients rather than sell. You never know do you. So there there's the two products. Now what do you think? What do you, no difference. Same same training course in effect. Different weeks I mean we concentrate on wallets because of the pitch. Any preference. Looks more professional right? Mhm. From a a layman's point of view. But I think you'd get more business out of the smaller one. So which is the easier pitch? Remember you're going into this for the first time. That one? I I would say so . Shall we talk about these? Yeah. Okay. Different companies you see Yeah. in the same division. I'll let you take I'll you take this as well all right? So that you can. But what we're talking about now is that we've made up our mind A that you er I believe and you believe you can do this job. Yeah. So we've got belief in each other. Erm B we have now decided the company and because you've decided this company will also determine how soon you can start. Because this course is every two weeks that one's every week. Right? Right. I'll take that out of your way. You get to take these products away. Let me open up that one. See the difference designs. Yeah. That's actually the the front. Who designs the Right. the adverts. You've asked the question. It just preempts something I tell tell people anyway. But let's have a look at all the all of the design. If it doesn't exist already Sorry. If it doesn't exist already Yep. You're not going to get away with that. Erm Forgot it was there actually. we we take what er they they want. If if erm a lot of these will probably be lifted from Yellow Pages. Yeah. They'll be lifted from local papers. Ninety nine percent of the time they've got copy that exists. We will change anything they want. We will add anything they want. We will design the full ad for them if they want at no extra cost. Yeah yeah. When they come on and say, Yeah no I haven't advertised before that will cost me extra money. You say, No it won't. All I need for you to tell me right now is you're going to commit yourself to this product and I will come round and we'll sign the contract, all the stuff you told him, then we'll talk about copy and it doesn't cost you anything. We'll do it for you. You get a chance to see the proof and and er erm approve it. Okay? Right okay. But you will find particularly this size of ad, although it doesn't matter what size the copy is Yeah. we'll reduce it erm and we'll probably retype it. And we'll juggle it around and give them you know er one or two options. Yeah. Let's have a look first all er just step back slightly to the time when the sales exec goes round to sign up the estate agent. He will he will establish from certain facts how many they they think they'll need for us to print. Okay there's a small estate agent will print ten thousand. Now these are guaranteed we guarantee to print these. They can have as many as they want really. Yeah. Cos all once it's all set up we can just reprint. But that that will be determined by the sales exec when they go round to sign the contract. Not not by you but by the contact. Okay? And if we're gonna print that number, say thirty five, it automatically internally it will generate that target. And that's the sort of target we're going to look for from that assignment. But there is a cutoff point which we know internally, you won't get to know, where we know we've got enough money to cover all of our costs in that first year. We don't want any costs to come out of the second year cos that's where we make our profit. Profit. Yeah. All the commissions, and you only get paid I say only you get paid commission on the first year. Second year you're on another assignment anyway so it doesn't make no repeat. There's no point in having So there's no repeat business? No. Erm so that's a figure if you like you have have up here in your noodle and say I need to go for that anyway. But you always have this figure certainly slapped in your mind. At four and a half thousand pound of sales we start to pay extra fift in fact at four thousand pound we start but it's only a small bonus so I home in on the bigger one. We pay fifteen percent extra on to all all the business you bring in above that figure. Okay? So you need to have that figure in your mind not necessarily that one. Yeah. Your money making figure. Aha. Now that's just a notional one for us to to target internally make sure all our costs come within a certain Excuse me. Hello. Yes could you invite her to have a cup of tea and I'll be er ten minutes or so. Thank you very much. Bye. Erm okay so where are we up to. Erm yes there's the there's the the er bonus er element. We pay the bonuses at proof stage and I'll explain why in a minute okay. All your other commissions thirty percent on all your sales are paid the following week. So there's no waiting around. Do the of it there's plenty in there. you get paid next week. Right okay. Just to give you an idea of the prices. If you compare the the positions one oh beg your pardon you'll need that out. I'll need that one. When you start the assignment er every assignment you get one of these all right? Right. And you use this to mark off of course Yeah. where you have erm the ones you've sold. So now you can relate positions one to three to how much they cost and so on on the way down. The flap is sold. Even though it looks at first it's a ridiculous thing to do. Oh right. Right. When when when people receive that they tear that off and the flap drops down. And er that You study that but that's your work horse. You get a brand new one of these every time. You can have ten percent discount immediately if you need it. But if if we find anybody's a persistent discounter they're causing trouble for the person who comes to resell . That's right. Although it's two years later they've got to resell at the price that er it's been discounted more or less. Unless we can persuade them in two years costs have gone up and of course we will. Typical example. If you homed in on erm one to eight on the flap that would er create the average revenue which is the average across all of our products of six thousand pound. That's what we we find is the average sale. And that's your earning in two to three weeks. Two weeks we hope. Where it's made up of thirty percent commission and the bonuses. Now that's good money in anybody's er Thousand pound a week yeah. If you sold the whole you know it's possible to sell you know it's it's done. In fact I'm not far off there in fact. This is one of ours. I'll explain that one in a minute. If you sold the whole of this that's the earning and you've got to do this excuse me, in three weeks. That's nearly a thousand pound a week. And that's I think what everybody should be trying to aim for. It's there it's available. That's the only freebie there in this particular product. Every time there's a special, it doesn't cost them anything, but anytime they put that in it means they can take this product this this in to that company and get some extra deal. Mm get a discount. Now as soon as anybody puts that in as you'll notice they've nearly all got them in, that's another advantage of course that they will retain this. If they know they can get special deals. So every one of these has got that symbol. As soon as one just one company decides to take that seal we've got to put that ad in somewhere. Now if we sold the whole lot we're gonna struggle a bit. Right. But it will be there somewhere okay? Even if it's er But it wouldn't be from nine to twelve? Mm? It wouldn't be from nine to twelve. It'll be one of those two. Okay right. Okay. I mean it it'll go in certain into that's a selling pitch too. Because that means that the people have got to take this in. Which means it's it's like a big business card. When you go to er prospective clients. Okay you've talked to them the phone right and you're gonna go and sign them up. Mhm yeah. Right? Do you write in Joe Bloggs Er no. this. I would suggest you didn't. You just say sold and may be have your own code. Right yeah okay. Just in case there was a Jonesy you know. Whether that would work or not . Yeah. If you put if you put Jones the builder there and and er Wilson the builder And you're gonna see another builder. and you're gonna take another builder er they will tell you exactly how to approach that. We do have a statement in our contract that they sign to acknowledge that they are not er don't have a dem right to sole They're they're not exclusive. Yeah. They're not exclusive to advertise in this If it's your last slot and you haven't got another builder you say, Absolutely guarantee there's not gonna be another builder in. I'll give you that guarantee myself the company don't like me doing this but I will guarantee. Because you know there's no other builder if that's your last one. Oh yeah. I thought you meant if there was a builder here and that was the last one you sell you. Tell them lies. No no. Evil class admissible today even a lot better than them. Yeah. Right okay. And if a builder gonna go down there you say, Well look I've got one down here but I've got a prime slot Yeah they're all prime slots. they're all prime slots but this one you know you gonna no you're gonna pay a bit more you see. That's the point. This guy's taken this one down here. Well I'll tell you right now I have got another builder on but he's taken one of the er the slots further down but I've got one I've got a prime er the the estate agent asked me to contact you because there is a prime slot left. But I'm you know that that could go this afternoon when I go to a couple of other appointments. And that's basically that charges is it for Yeah. Six fifty for the top three then then down the scale to nine to twelve is four hundred and fifty. On er er the flap in its entirety is twelve hundred pounds. Right. If if they take both sides. Yeah which is which is this. Yeah. And and all of that If you do if you do that's six hundred pound all right? And so is that six hundred pound if they want to buy both sides. And that sticky comes off and so they open it yeah and that's You notice they will also sell it as individuals. In in the inside so nothing goes on that. Right okay. Yeah yeah. They'll tell you all about that on the course. Right. Okay? Yep. Right. The outside is the estate agents and I've never known anybody give that up. No. Cost cost the earth. Okay that's for you to take away. As all this is. Right. So if I get that out the way I'm going to go through very quickly the administration that we look for. And the reason why we make sure that when we go to see a prospective advertiser they'll know all these sorts of details. This contract is applicable across, no that's that no that's the one that's the one that we use on . So that you know see that they're all different colours. Yeah. Six six contracts all the same print so that if ever we shifted you or wanted you wanted to shift you from estate into to golf or to schools we don't have to retrain you at all. Except may be in the pitch. Yep. But these are the sorts of things and I'm not going to great detail because the training course does that, these are the things that they will blow you out on. If you don't tell them that you're going to pick up a thirty five percent deposit cheque. Yeah yeah that's They don't know that cos that's your commission cheque. That covers you for us paying you in the next week. That's right yeah. If you don't tell them that we want a banker's order to take out the er annual payments. Right these are the sorts of things if you spring those on them. If you, ah now can I ask you to sign that and then the banker's order And by the way yeah. there's the banker, What's with this banker's order I don't deal with a banker's order. That's right. You didn't tell me anything about the cheque. Yeah. You didn't tell me that there may be two signatories on the cheque. You've got to establish that before you go round. Is it just you who signs the cheque? Yeah okay yeah. And the banker's order. They'll say, Well no the financial director will need it. I'll say, Well we need the financial director there as well. When I come round I need them both there. If you left this anywhere you'd never see it again. No. It's another reason they'll blow you out . You just leave I'll saying, put it in the post for you. Forget it. Yep. So that's generated two of the bits of information we want the other Is it an annual charge or is it a twelve month payment thing on it, or just an annual charge? Yeah it it's er when you quote a price it's per year for two years minimum all right? Yeah. But is there a facility for a twelve months payment order or No. You mean monthly over twelve months ? Yeah. No. So it's just Really don't mess around with that. Right okay. Yeah cos you can print it and then two downs two months down the line they could pull out and you've you've Oh absolutely yeah. printed it for nought. Yeah. I mean we get some people that pull out er cancel or go under and then we don't get the second year's payment. That's nothing to do with you. Not No. even the first year's payment's anything to do with you. Just that deposit cheque. You're not asked to chase any money after that. Right okay. The other er bits of information of course we need to know what co I've already spoken about the copy. What we will do for them. Yeah. This is the document they use in association with the with the copy. So once we've got that the contract and the cheque, yippee we can send off our commission form at the end of the week with all the deals in the envelope. And that's what we use. Right. There's one written out so it looks at least. You have your own number Number. the assignment has it's unique number Number You just list out the advertisers, we list out the type of contract it is. There are one or two exceptions on medical side that er we we call on the approved list Yeah. Don't need cont er don't need banker's orders and they don't need cheques but we have to have an order from the company. Yeah. attached. Are these erm inclusive of VAT or is there no VAT on advertising any more? Yes there is yes. Yeah there So those places haven't ? They're exclusive of VAT. When you quote six hundred and fifty pound plus VAT. Right that's okay right. But the commission's paid on net? Yes. Yeah. That's that's actually That's the cost of the ad exclusive of VAT. If you are VAT registered yourself of course Yeah. and we hope most people would be because thirty six thousand pound, if they're all earning thirty six thousand I used to well I was VAT but pulled out . I still am. Yeah. Erm that's the amount of you commission and that's probably the lowest er you know the lowest that er you'd get well three hundred and fifty pounds. So you'd just be about a hundred and I think a hundred and ten is the lowest commission you get for any deal in our company. Right. And the highest is somewhere around seven hundred and fifty I think for one deal. Same same contract they're signing same contract. The size of the ad is bigger. Right. I mentioned earlier on that you you get paid erm bonuses at proof stage. That's where you claim. And they have to be claimed. Every two months a list of numbers of the assignments that have been proofed, that means all the ads have been done across the products and all the proofs have been sent out, we've also clai got the balance of the first year's payment. We are now prepared to pay you bonuses. Right so we get paid the extra fifteen or whatever If you're entitled you will know exactly you will keep a record don't worry. Oh I think so yeah. When er when you spot that number on the list that comes out to you you can claim. And that's where you claim. A lot of people leave it in there to accrue to pay tax or whatever. It's a good idea actually. Yeah it's You won't forfeit it but you still have to remember you've gotta claim for it all the time. So claimed his after two years recently and got about six thousand pound. Yeah. New car or whatever holiday. Yeah. Okay. But you you're entitled to it so you can claim it any time you want. You just keep a note of it and I think this is for you Robert this this er this job not this job this opportunity. Yeah yes. Different exciting intriguing. Super. Yeah.

Look forward to seeing you over in head office sometime. Right. Now when I spoke to Mrs on the telephone last night she told me about the work you've been doing on and I have looked at it and I'm going to go over it again with you this afternoon because she thought it was very very good work. And she's marked it and I'm going to give it back to you and talk to you about it. I was very very pleased to see that a lot of you have tried to do your join up handwriting after a bit of practice we'd had and it had come out really really nicely, well done. Josephine your work was on the top and I thought goodness that can't be Josephine's writing. It was very nice wasn't it? So good girl. And some of the others I still have to look at. So I want to look at them at dinner time and share them with you this afternoon. But because Mrs did that work with you yesterday you did not do your history work, so I'm going to talk to you a bit and ask you some questions about the tiny bit we talked about to do with Roman Britain and how the Romans invaded Britain two thousand years ago. So sorry just a moment. If you could pop into five A, yes I would prefer to see music's doing do you know what I mean? Just sit down and and sit still for a minute because you'll be standing for a long time playing the recorder as well, if you want if you want to go to the toilet just take yourself all right . Seems to be something else going on. Let's go back to the invasion of Britain two thousand years ago. But it was less than two thousand years ago in actual fact that the first emperor Julius Caesar into Great Britain wasn't it? Can you remember how we talked about the Romans having a very strong army and how they captured land around Rome around it's lake and before long they'd captured land all around the Mediterranean Sea and they formed that into what we call the Roman Empire. And Julius Caesar stood in France in because he was in , the place he captured in France, and he could see Britain across the water and he wondered what the land was like over there. And he came over with . Er let's see if you can remember the year that was. It was after Jesus was born so we call that B C, no sorry it wasn't after it was before Jesus was born we call it B C before Christ. It was about two thousand years ago and it was how many years before Christ. Jody perhaps you could like would like to think, if you want us to listen to your playing this afternoon I would like you to listen to what I have to say this morning please. Can you tell us? Can you tell us? On the top of this sheet it told you. Kieran. Fifty five. Good it was fifty five B C. Fifty five years before Jesus was born. And you know we've had bible stories just before Christmas we know about the Romans being there in in erm Greece and Rome and all around that area at that time. Because when Jesus was born the the Roman soldiers were there and the kind at that time Herod ordered that all babies were killed and the Romans went out to do that didn't they? All babies born You tell us Kieran sorry? He killed the and heard that Jesus was born and he would be made king so he sent his men to go out and find every baby that was under two or three years old and kill them. Can you speak up when you're telling us. And erm Joseph and Mary they went to Egypt or somewhere, yeah Egypt, and when they went erm and I think the angels called them to go cos they came to Egypt as well and then they went to . Going to Bethlehem to get taxed didn't they? So we do know and we we do remember reading about bi er Romans in the bible at that time. Yes Daisy? Can I go the toilet? If you're very quick because you might miss out on what we're going to talk about. Was there anybody in here who plays a recorder and has some knowledge already of music and would be interested trying for the violin? I mean not just trying but if you if you get chosen to play the violin it means practising and practising and staying with it so that you become a good violin player. I think I'll do that for you Mr . Shh. Excuse me. Okay put your hands down again. Shh. Stacey we were just talking I've interrupted this talk on the Romans. Talk about or Mr has, er to to ask about anybody interested in violins playing. And I know you enjoy playing music. Er put your hands down for the moment. I'll I promised Mr a list but I've had a very busy week and haven't done him a list this week and I have promised and I've broken a promise. So I'm going to promise and you've got to remind me about this promise that the next Tuesday, that's when you're or even Wednesday, but if I give it you Tuesday we can be organized for Wednesday can't we? The the next Tuesday I'll give him a list of people who are interested and that means asking at home as well. Because it's no good saying you're interested and then going to ask your mother or father if you could talk a violin home and they said no I don't want you practising at home I don't like the sound of it or whatever. But sometimes mum and dads don't like you practising, so you need you need to ask and if you are chosen you need to commit yourself. That means turn up to all the practices and stick with it and join the orchestra and play in concerts as you get better all right? So it is a commitment it's not just for, oh I'd like to have a go. If you want to have a go I could bring my violin in and you can have a go at my violin any time. That's a different thing isn't it? Having a go and sticking with it? You may like you may have a try and find that you don't particularly en er like like it after all. But if I give some names to Mr next week I think yes well I've got them at the music later today so I can ask them then. Okay then sorry I hadn't . Right. Yes yes. Let's stop talking, sorry about the interruptions. So fifty five years before Jesus was born the Romans were already he was born I think but they had not come as far as Britain. Who was the who was the emperor at the time who decided to send soldiers and the army to Britain? Jennifer. Was it Julius Caesar? It was. It was Julius Caesar he was a very famous Roman Emperor and a famous English writer called Shakespeare wrote a story about Julius Caesar. Right he sent only a very small army and when they arrived on the shores. Let's talk about first of all the boat that they went in. How did they get across the water? Wasn't? You don't think it was. What do you think Kieran? Erm they went on a ship that looked a little bit like dry bean. Yes. They had rows on the bottom all the and some of the men on the top. Right a trireme a Greek warship had three layers didn't it? And I I do believe that the Roman boats had two. They had the deck on the top where all the Roman soldiers stood in their uniform, I say their uniform I mean their armour don't I? Er and all their fighting gear and we're we're going to have a look at a Roman legionnaire. That was their name a legionnaire because they belonged to a legion of erm the Roman army. Er and we'll have a look at all the things that they carried and erm fought with later on. But they had all their equipment with them and they just stood on the deck and underneath below deck were the people who rowed the boats over. Who were they? Yes? The slaves. The slaves yes they had slaves to row. And when they arrived Great Britain or Britain as it was called then and the people living there were Britons. Also Celts. And when they arrived some of the Celtic tribes were standing on the shore and they were very very fierce, bright red hair some of them had and beards. I think a lot of these Roman people had never seen red hair before, people who looked quite so fierce. And even though they were supposed to be the biggest and gravest army in the world they were frightened to get off the So what, who was the first person who stepped on land? See if you can remember because we did we did talk to you a very short time about this on Monday. Now let's have somebody else different because I I know there's been listening hard obviously. Katrina? Yes that that's right it had a special name. The person who held the well what was he called? Standard bearer. Do you remember he was called the standard bearer. See if I can find you a picture of a of a, I've got a picture of a Roman legionnaire here but not the standard bearer. Standard bearer's like a pole it was a pole they held, that's what the Roman soldiers look like look the Roman legionnaires and the standard bearer had a pole with shields on it. And he stepped forward first. Now once he'd stepped forward on to the on to the shore what happened? They, what's the word you want? Stepped on They followed didn't they. They followed. Phillip. His tooth's fell out. Do you need to wash your mouth out Adam? Yes. Go on then quickly. We're having a a lose a tooth week I think. Erm right so it was it was supposed to be a disgrace to lose your standard in your legion in the Roman army. So there was way they were going to let the standard bearer go on his own and face all these fierce fighters. They had to go and give him some support and they put up quite a good fight. They didn't have enough people with them, they didn't have a big enough army. So they decided to retreat. What does retreat mean? What does retreat mean? Do you do you know Phillip? Does it mean go back? Go back that's right good. So they got back on their boats and they went back. They went back to France which was already part of the Roman Empire. Perhaps back to Rome where they'd come from to see their families. Can we have dental inspection please. Yes. Is it is it absolutely necessary? Mrs has already asked for her class to be after one and we've only got the two classes to do. Erm right erm Jennifer. I tell you what we could do cos Mr might have to stay. Jennifer could you ask Mr if he could just pop in and see me a minute. You can turn the tape off and we can carry on this Oh wait a minute. She seems to be Oh erm You can carry on this afternoon. You've got me first two lessons after dinner haven't you? So that would be all right I think. Let me just have a word with I was going to say can we take them in small groups? Is that any help? Not really cos it's a sort of discussion with the whole class so I need the sort of feed back Oh. Okay? Have all the other classes been looked at? Yes. They have to go for a dental inspection That's all . And we're the only ones that haven't been. We do have a double lesson after dinner which we could continue this. That's perfectly okay. If that's all right with you. Yes. Okay. Right then could you g you want all of them. We want the girls first in registration order or alphabetical order. Well I'll tell you what we'll do then because we don't want to sit here, just a moment, before you go, don't start talking. I would like the boys to go and get out their topic folders and colour the map that shows all the things that the Romans are hoping to find in Great Britain. That's a simple task you can do while the girls are at the dentist. And when the girls come back they can do that while you go to the dentist. And girls I don't know whether you know your order in the registers. If you can work it out and stand at at the door and I'll get the register to check. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Pearson's first half results. One way or another we've had a pretty busy six months. As you know we've decided to concentrate our management and financial resources on our media interests, which cover the information, education and entertainment markets and in which our spread of businesses including books, newspapers, family attractions and television are well placed for future growth. In June we acquired Thames Television, with its valuable programme rights, distribution business and production capability. And we have a crack at Star T V. The plans we announced on twenty seventh July to demerge Doulton and float Camco are already underway. Until such time as they leave the group, figures from these two businesses obviously continue to form part of our accounts. I'm pleased to say that in the course of the last six months we've seen a strong recovery in profits. So, let's now look at the results. Overall our nineteen ninety three first half pre-tax profits stand at forty six million for all our businesses including Doulton and Camco. That's nearly twelve million better than for nineteen ninety two and reflects its satisfying improvement in underlying performance. Sales were up by nineteen percent and there's also firm evidence in these results of margin improvements which reflect, for the first time, the full benefit of our cost cutting measures taken over the last three years. We've become better at making money in sluggish trading conditions and are making the most of the patchy recovery we've seen in some of our markets. Our overall operating profit has increased by some seventy percent over the same period last year. The difference between operating profit and profit before tax is of course made up of interest on non-operating items. James will cover er, this area in more detail later in the presentation. Earnings per share are up er, more than forty percent over the same period last year and when the E P S is adjusted to take account of the non-operating items, and, and he ends up with this book invoking the idea that science should replace erm, religion in, in this respect. In other words that science should establish insights into reality which make social order erm, both possible and well founded. Now in this particular book, Freud doesn't say very much about what these insights er, are. And er, as you'll see, probably next week's, I'm not going to get to this now, er, next week, or possible the week after, even, depending on how long it takes me to get there, I will suggest to you that the revolution now taking place in behavioural science, does suggest wh what they are, and that there are in fact some deeply countering intuitive insights, erm, into this whole issue, which have only emerged in the last few years. But er, this is just by way of an anticipation, the the general conclusion comes for instance, in this rather generalized book, and relatively short book, is that we ought to base variety and social order on science, and its insights, and certainly not on, on religion, and, and there he, there he leaves the question. However, he takes it up again, at much greater length, in his next book of nineteen thirty, Civilization and its Discontents. This book erm, begins, once again with the Hobbesian problem. The,wi with the, with the question of social order. Only in this book, it comes out even more clearly. Civilization, says Freud, is based on the suppression, repression and inhibition and frustration of the id people's individual er, drives, especially their sexual and aggressive drives, which are deeply compromised by having to live erm, in a civilized er, society. So er, in so far as human nature can be equated with the id, it seems to me, perfectly correct to say that Frob erm,Frob I was going to say, Freud, Freud was a Hobbesian thinker. Hobbes was a Freudian thinker, no. Freud was a Hobbesian thinker, erm, in the sense that the id, certainly was egoistic, anti-social and everything that Thomas Hobbes said about human nature, er, could apply to the id, that's perfectly true, and most people see this, and it's er it, it's a commonplace, particularly in the social science writing on Freud. And a lot of the book is concerned with developing this theme, and that I thought came out quite well in the classes, so I won't bother to repeat all that, because I thought we did that fairly thoroughly in, in the class. I don't want to waste your time. What people don't notice, however, and is so important, is that the id is not the only institution of a personality. As we saw, there is a second area of a personality, which psychoanalysis during the nineteen twenties and thirties was exploring actively and this is the ego. If we now look at the ego, as opposed to the id, then immediately we see that it is, it is emphatically not true to claim that Freud was a Hobbesian social thinker. Because the ego was not anti-social but pro-social, and we've already seen er two ways in which that is true. When we looked at group psychology and analysis of the ego, we saw that it was processes that occur in the ego, such as identification and projection, that make social groups possible, that bring about the social order of psychological groups. So that makes the ego pro-social, and in Future of an Illusion, we saw Freud arguing, that there were fundamental pro-social currents of feeling in the ego, in terms of the ego's wish fulfilment for, for example, a benevolent god, a divine justice and things like this. These are wishes of the ego, and they're gratified in the illusion of religion, but as we've also seen, Freud erm, notices even though he doesn't comment, that the illusion of religion is pro-social, in the sense that it maintains social order, systems and morality, and so on. So it seems to me that those sociologists, and there've been a lot of them, who have taken the view that Freud like some other social thinkers, like any of their kind, for example, was a, was simply a Hobbesian thinker, hadn't really read their Freud, or at least they hadn't read their Freud after about World War One. You could certainly take that view of Freud, and it would have been true, perhaps, if Freud had died er, before, er, nineteen eighteen, shall we say, or in fourteen. Then I think people would be justified in saying, well, Freud was essentially a Hobbesian social thinker. That was the time when Freud was exploring just the id. After World War One, as we've been seeing, he was exploring the ego, and his writing about the ego, in particular, group psychology and Future of an Illusion, show quite clearly that he saw the ego as a pro-social fact in the personality. Something that impelled the individual towards identifying with other people, performing groups, to accepting norms and values for these super-ego, which emerges during this time, and so on. So I think the, the statement Freud was a Hobbesian social thinker is just wrong. It's factually wrong, or at least it's factually wrong, if you were taking note of Freud's writings after World War One. If you look at all Freud's writings, I think what you have to say is, if you want to say that, you must make the qualification that the id is a Hobbesian erm, thing as it were, but the ego is a pro-social erm, part of the personality. Now here, it's useful to contrast the Hobbesian approach, which I call the pessimistic view of human nature, with one that I would call optimistic. Now the optimistic view of nature is the exact opposite. A good example of this, if we wanted to er, have somebody as it were, to counterbalance er, the English philosopher Hobbes, would be the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, writing a little bit later, not much actually seventeen twelve to seventeen seventy eight erm, about a century later. Jean Jacques Rousseau, famous French philosopher, whose view of human nature, was what I would call optimistic, in the sense that, by contrast to Thomas Hobbes, John Rousseau believed that human beings were basically good. He believed that human beings were born sociable, cooperative, altruistic, nice, civilized and that if, in later life, they showed anti-social selfish, criminal erm, egoistic tendencies, it was because of what happened to them after they were born. It was because of the effects of other people and society on them, that they were corrupted as it were. I once met a social worker, this was years ago, I I was gonna say, this couldn't happen today, but it probably could, erm, one hopes it couldn't happen today, but it probably would happen today, too. A social worker, who said to me, inside every, every, what she say so inside er, every juvenile delinquent, there's a little Leonardo da Vinci trying to get out. Well, if you believe that, I think you'll believe anything. But erm, that's the idea, you see, that these kids, er well, you know, they may be delinquent, and do lots of nasty things, but it's only the way they've been treated by society. Basically, human nature is good. This was, this is what I call an optimistic view, and this was Rousseau's view of human nature, that basically people were good, and er, cooperative, and it was the bad things in human nature that had to be explained, not the good. The good was natural. But the bad things, and of course, Rousseau's solution to the problem of order was quite different from Hobbes'. Hobbes' solution was, order must be imposed on a recalcitrant human nature, to make society possible, Rousseau's theory was, if only people could be liberated from the things that makes them selfish, selfish and anti-social, they would come together in a natural social contract, where individuals would spontaneously give up their freedom, in order to gain the benefits of social cooperation, and Rousseau's view was, if only people were, were fully rational, and could free themselves from the unfortunate effects of, of er civilization, they would enter into a state of erm, perfect society in which they could er, associate er without the, the necessity of things like the state or or whatever. Very very optimistic view of human nature. Later, erm, this was developed by people like Marx, who emphasized the ec economic role, erm, the e economic aspect of erm, of er, the ill effects of civilization. But basically the idea, erm, is I think well represented by er, by Rousseau, and it's a view that has been very influential, for instance, in modern education, and some people would say it explains the disaster that erm th that some people think er modern education is. Now, the these two views of human nature, the pessimistic, as I'm calling it, and the optimistic lead to two different views of the child, as I've already implied. The Rousseau view of the child, is one where children are basically er, noble savages. Are born free, but everywhere in the chain, as to quote a famous phrase from Rousseau, the kind of noble savage view of the child. This regards the child as not in need of socialization or control, but basically er, good in its own right. In the best example, in modern education, is that er, progressive school, what's the school, Summer Hill or the school where the kids are allowed to do absolutely everything they like. Erm, very revealing. Erm, er, if you, if you know anything about the kind of thing that actually goes on er, it's nothing like the it's supposed to be. But that was the, that was the theory that it was founded on. That, that, you know, if you give children complete freedom, they will, they will know, as it were,wh what's best for them, you don't need any, any rules, or anything. Or at least er, not any rules they don't impose on themselves. So that's the, that's the, there's an optimistic view of, of, of the child. The pessimist, the Hobbesian thinkers, have a pessimistic view of the child. They see the child as basically a, a little animal, a wild animal, who has to be tamed, and er, disciplined and controlled by er, various means, and er, this is the, I think the view of the child that was more popular in British education, at least traditional education, which erm, for the public schools of Eton, which in this country was based on er, on er brutality, I think there's the only word you can call it. Certainly, I'd never erm, forgiven er people for beatings I got at school. I mean there's downright brutality, and, and, and deserved to be called nothing else. But anyway, the idea that the brutality is er justified, and you have to beat the hell out of little kids because er, if you don't you won't civilize them. This goes, I think you can see, with the pessimistic view, the Hobbesian view, that for civilization order has to be, has to be imposed. Well, where does Freud stand in all this? You, seems to me that, if you think about it, the Freudian view is what I would like to call a realistic one. Because just as I was saying, that Freud's view was that, okay, there's the id and that may be Hobbesian, but there's also the ego, which if you like is, is more kind of Rousseauness it's pro-social, and therefore I would say Freud is not a pessimistic, or an optimistic social thinker, but something in between. What I would call a realistic social thinker, namely, somebody who saw there is good and bad in human nature. Freud didn't go to one extreme or the other, he didn't go to the Hobbes extreme and say there is no good in us you know, we're just anti-social egoists, although he did know that was true of the id. Nor did he go to the Rousseau extreme, saying that we're basically noble savages. But he did recognize that there was strong pro-social currents in the, in the ego, and the resulting view, I think, is what I would call a realistic view of human nature. Which I think any sensible person ought to come to, which is, that human beings are neither basically bad, evil, and anti-social, no more are they basically good, altruistic and cooperative. They're a mixture of both. Sometimes, people can be evil, egoistic, destructive and aggressive, and think only of themselves as we know to our cost, and as we see all around us in the world, from time to time. But at other times, as we also know, people can be remarkably altruistic and committed to others. You've only got to think of the career of erm, Audrey Hepburn who died today, or yesterday, whenever it was. Well, she's a shining example of that. The Audrey Hepburns in this world, may not be as numerous, unfortunately, as the people running around in Bosnia, or er Somalia, but they do exist, and you have to see that there are both of these sides of human nature. People can be very good, they can also be very bad. It seems to me the Freudian view takes both into account. Furthermore, it doesn't just take both into account in terms of some vague philosophical waffle, you know, that anybody could come to, sitting on a bar stool, after they've had enough er, dry martinis, you know as people sometimes good, people sometimes bad. I mean that, this kind of, that, that, that's a cliche. I mean, the Freudian insight is a much deeper one. It says the personality is structured in such a way that there is an egoistic anti-social area, the id. That there is another pro-social erm, constituent, the ego, and furthermore, these are different, and different things occur in each, and different processes occur. For example, the pro-social erm, factors mobilize projection and identification, and the anti- social ones are to do with the instinctual drives, and, and, and so on . So it, it, it's a, it goes much beyond merely a kind of er, cliche, of saying, all people can be sometimes good or people can be sometimes bad, and it tells you about the specific way in which this th this comes about. An example, er, of what I'm talking about, which I think shows this very nicely, and is, is something I wanted to mention, because it's important in itself, is the shifts in Freud's views on anxiety. As we saw, in the early phase of psychoanalysis, before World War One, when it was dominated by the view of Freud and in the eighteen nineties, and when psychoanalysis was mainly id analysis, and concerned with the unconscious, Freud took the view of anxiety as a pathological transformation of the libido. The libido was then regarded as a kind of emotional torrent, that if it was frustrated underwent a pathological transformation into anxiety. Er, I think I mentioned this, I hope I did, pretty sure I did. After World War One, in the second phase of the psychoanalysis, when he was concerned with the analysis of ego, anxiety became a sense of danger in the ego, and the ego felt anxiety when it was threatened, and as a result, there was three sorts of anxiety neurotic anxiety, when the ego was threatened by the drives of the id moral anxiety, when it was threatened by punishment from the super ego, and realistic anxiety, when it was threatened by dangers from the outside world. Some early analysts, though not Freud, I, I emphasize, but some of his followers, took the view that anxiety, for example, in children, was pathological, and they, that generation of analysts tried to bring up their children to be free of anxiety, and, and then, you still get this in a lot of popular child psychology today, the idea that anxiety is always bad and always wrong. Anna Freud writing many years later in her classic book, erm, Normality of Pathology in Childhood, erm, candidly admits that er, the first generation of analysts was wrong about this, and she, she, she, she candidly says that the analytic profession changed its view, although Freud never did. Freud always regarded anxiety as normal, but the erm, many of his colleagues didn't, and, and Anna Freud erm admits that er, experience proved that er, her father's original view turned out to be, turned out to be the right one. And she says that attempts to free children of anxiety proved to be emissary. The reason is that erm, if the child ceases to be afraid, for example, of the parents, or of outside, of outside discipline or control, it instead becomes anxious and terrified of its own instinctual drives which it can't control. An anxiety appears to be a permanent fixture in human mental life, it's not one that you can, you can live without. Of course, if you take the Freudian view of anxiety as a danger signal in the, in the ego, that, that makes sense. And Anna Freud's conclusion is, that all children will experience anxiety, but what they experience anxiety about will, will vary, and clearly the best thing is that they experience anxiety about things that are important and are real, rather than anxiety about things that are unimportant and unreal. But in general, she admits that there was, there proved to be no way of freeing the child from anxiety. So anxiety would be, you see, would be something that points out what I'm calling this realistic view of human nature. That the, the other point to be made about the pessimistic and optimistic theories is, they, because they're extremely elusive, they can easily suggest the idea of utopias, and you get two different sorts of utopias. The pessimistic thing was, the Hobbesians always looked back to the past, some golden age of order in the past, you know, when, when people knew what to do and er, and er, things were right as it were, and th they tend to want to restore some ideal state of order and authority that existed in the past, which was much better than now, because civilization has gone to the dogs, and been corrupted and so on . And they look back, and er, these pessimistic views are usually reactionary. Politically, they're usually reactionary. The pessimists want to go back. I mean effectively, I always wanted to go back to the middle ages er, with, with the history books of English society. English society, of course didn't work out that way. The realis the opt optimistic theories, on the other hand, also had their utopias, but they look forward. For the, for the optimists, the, the utopia is, is always in the, in the future, and these people er, tend to be revolutionaries. They tend to say we must overthrow the existing social order and establish a new just social order, when human beings will be liberated from the corrupting erm, alienating er forces, that er, make them bad, and everything will be, everything will be okay. The Freudian realistic view it seems to me, couldn't allow you to draw either conclusion, you couldn't, neither conclude, that things were better in the past and therefore we ou ought to go back to the golden age, nor, could you conclude that things will ever be any better in the future. Anxiety for example, is something that human beings will always experience, and to think that you can free them from anxiety in some future utopia, or go back to some ordered erm, ideal state in the past, where everyone was so secure, that they would never feel anxiety, is just a myth according to Freud. Freud's view is a realistic one of human nature, which says that people will experience anxiety and frustration and er, all kinds of erm, feelings that they may not want to have. But they will experience those feelings, because human nature is not at either of these extreme points, it's neither erm, perfectly good, nor perfectly bad, it's a, it's a mixture of both, and consequently, although you can improve the world, for it doesn't deny you can improve the world, or make it worse, of course. To think that you could bring about a utopia, and perfect human nature in one way or another, is really a wildly er, optimistic and er, is in itself, er, some kind of illusion. Well, at that point I will end what I have to say for today, and er, carry on with this next week. Thank you very much Yes, yes, you can, can catch me now. Hobbesian theory being Yes, that's right, Yes, well, commiserations Er, no, it's a bit tough, I suppose You could bring some evolutionary insight to it. Oh yes, oh yes yes, that's right Oh yeah Are you keeping that sort of thing that that in some ways could be considered to be a system. If I let it run away with me, it might, you know tie it up I mean, if you like me to leave your paper, to write to one, I'll be quite pleased to look at it Okay, alright, if you want to discuss it with me. Okay. I mean if you want do a paper for this group, on, you know, on the sociological periods of evolution, and, and how they look from our perspective. You could substitute it, perhaps for that one. Yeah, okay, okay well look, Have a think about it yeah, okay. if, if you want to do a version of it first, I think we, we, we'll appreciate it very much. Okay, fine, okay yes. in order to get, because I hesitate to give you more work to do, you got enough work. fine. But, think about it, it could be interesting. Yeah, okay, sure, fine. We'll have words about it. Thank you. come on in. Now, I have some good news for you, and you could do with some good news, couldn't you? Yes. Least, I hope it's good news, from what you said last night, I think it would be good news. I have got you a computer, one of these would you like one of those? I'd love one of those. Right, we can get you one. I'll tell you what's happened. The thing is, the school has just launched a, a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students, okay? Now, we've got one in this department, like this, and er, one of our graduate students was very interested in it, and since she was just finishing her P H D the in some of the ways, some of the most erm, outspoken erm, persons for this, but I'm certainly not alone. There's a growing body now, of people who are thinking along similar lines, and er, so it's, it, it's, I think you'd be unwise to wipe this off just, just as my eccen eccentricity. I mean, it may be that. Look, we're gonna have to stop. we can carry on with this next week, as, as you see, we've touched on a big topic, so we'll, we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion, whatever way you think fit, erm, that raises other issues which you want to talk about. Okay. Thanks very much. And well done that was an excellent a little contradictory. Erm, I read another erm, book on believing this. Yeah, fine. Er, I have an example of Right. Could be, certainly quite old, erm, and a socialist, of course. Yeah. You ought to point out. Right. Not completely true. Ah, let me just say what leaders of peacetime Margaret was after early life was that a cold mother who was erm, full of personality People of London biography of the leader of the Conservative, because at least half the book is about That's where it belongs. Erm. at least not fully in command of ourselves, let alone the social and political world around us. It's certainly wrong though,I think erm, there was erm, the question Mm. Er, but I do believe that made very important the reason, er, the first question is and people weren't reading about that. Erm, Well Well done, that was absolutely first rate, I mean erm, it was a difficult er, task you had, especially as the book wasn't in the library, of which I am deeply apologetic, because I thought it was, and er, I thought you er, you coped with a very difficult assignment extremely well, and I think you can have an extra and I'm sure everyone else thinks so too. Er, as I have said, I haven't done Woodrow Wilson before in the past, so, so it was an experiment, and erm, I must admit,yo you rose to the occasion excellently. The choice of literature, as you realize was meant to be contrasting, and I put book down as an example of what I thought was the worst possible, er, use of use of psychoanalysis, kind of gutter journalism, erm and which you didn't look at, and it's, it's no criticism of you erm, because er, you had your work cut out with what you did do, but the reason I put down Gandhi's Truth, if anybody's ever read that, have they? This is the exact opposite from , because it's erm, it idealizes Gandhi. It kind of builds Gandhi up into a great er figure, as it were, ignoring his feet of clay, erm, which he definitely had. So erm,book on which is kind of a character association by a pop cycle analysis and Gan erm, book on Gandhi, which is using cycle analysis, of, of, of, of tremendous contrast. And er, er, the question is of course, where does Freud's book on Woodrow Wilson belong? Does it belong in the kind of erm, camp or not? Well, erm, what do other people think? But isn't, isn't that the quote at the beginning of your book, er, unsigned quote, erm, doesn't that say something about how, how, you know, long aired radio biography of someone is very political or sort of er, disregard all of the important things they really done, and I don't know, I don't know if it's er, pertinent erm, but obviously, in Freud, Freud wanted to set out to criticize Wilson erm, so he, you know, he went in with it. I mean, he was Yes. obviously going to buck out of the He was. biographical allegiance which made him look bad. Yes. Erm, and er, on other hand he got everything, got his own book out biography Of course, I think if, if, if Freud were here, he would defend himself, by saying I was quite open about my prejudice against Wilson at the beginning of the book, as reminds us, Freud says quite clearly, how he felt about all this. But I think Freud would have also gone on to say that he had very good reason for resenting Wilson, because he blamed Wilson personally for the unjust peace, after er Versailles, but er, was indirectly, many people would argue, going to lead to the Second World War, and er, so Freud's defence I think would be, this man really was responsible. Because after all, the situation in my, I don't know, I mean, I don't know how well you know your modern history. I'm not certain, I'm not a great expert on it, but erm, the situation seems to be, that after the First World War, the central power was Germany and Austria, were defeated. Er, France, er was, er battle ravaged and its economy in ruins. This country was bankrupt, and had to borrow money from the United States of America to keep going, and er, Russia had just had a revolution and was still in chaos. So the United States was really the only world power erm, erm, as were able to do anything. In, in some ways, the situation you know, was a bit like, like what it is now, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, only more so, I would say, because the, the other powers were more, were even more prostrate than is, is, is the situation today. So for a while, the President of the United States effectively had world power, there was no other power in the world who could stand up to the U S, er, after, after, World War One for one argument anyway, and I think Freud's er, defence disposition would be, Woodrow Wilson was the man who came to Europe, saying he would bring a just peace for all, and went away leaving a total mess, and, and, Freud's er argument in his book is, told us was, well, the mess er, was really Wilson's own doing, and if it was his doing, what was it in his character that allowed him to er,si to on some Lloyd George, who bullied him into getting most of what they wanted. So, that would be Freud's defence, now, I suppose you would have to know a lot more about modern history, to, to know, if this was really true or not, but erm, the the er, question that Freud was really asking himself, really was, why did Wilson let us down, because Freud admits that he regarded Wilson, when he came to Europe as a saviour. You know, here, here was somebody coming from outside Europe who would bring, you know, peace and justice for all. Let's hope, I quoted the American Constitution correctly, did I? Erm, you know, perhaps the kind of way people look on President today. You know, which is only day one of his inauguration. We'll see what happens to him, President . But erm, that would be for its, for its er,defence, I suppose. Is it fallible I mean how do, how do modern America let's ask er and erm, er and . How do modern Americans see Woodrow Wilson? Erm What's your image of him? er, I don't know, I think he forgot you know, Yeah I don't, I don't I remembered him having in my school library Mm. he was regarded as a very very smart man Mm. and er, one of our most intellectual presidents. Yeah. And I don't think, I don't think most people considered him vulnerable, very vulnerable. I mean, they know that working Yeah. But I don't think most people, er, would necessarily consider it than now on the European side, they might consider . Erm, but you know, but I think they did. I think it marks the beginning of the United States their first real world power. So I think that's, that's how he was I see. Mm. So people don't blame him for the consequences of Versailles? I don't think so. No, no. To answer my own question, I did. I mean, I think Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. What about er, European history, who's studied this period in modern history at school? Have you? Yes. What question do you go to Woodrow Wilson? frankly, he was a I see. No. everything he wants. But the things is, he wanted to a lot of things about came up like in the middle Mm. ages before the war you more you think about it, Mm. Yes. I see, yes. Anyone else got a view on this? He was a very odd man, though Mm. as Freud said, that at fourteen adult life Good one, doc, yes, And erm, I mean er, the last eighteen months of his presidency he erm, settled with Mrs Wilson because he would be incapable Yeah, the, of course, er, Freud had one advantage here, and that was Bullitt. Erm, as we know, Bullitt was a member of the delegation and an intimate of, of Wilson, so the book is er co- authored, so in a sense we should know as we're paying for, for all of it, because er, obviously, he relied on Bullitt to give him all this biographical information, and er, consequently what you see Freud doing in this in this book is, is er trawling through, as it were, the things that Bullitt told him, that, that Bullitt had found out, to erm, draw a kind of psy psychoanalytic portrait of Woodrow Wilson, that erm, tried to explain his problem, why did he not deliver the goods as it were . And the if you put the character of Woodrow Wilson aside, the, the central theme which comes out of this book, which is I think why it's important, worth reading certainly the introduction is worth reading. There is a three or four page brief introduction er, to the book, which is presumably by Freud himself, because it's about psychoanalysis, and I don't think Bullitt could have written it. Erm, what's worth reading about that, and it comes out strongly in the introduction, is that this is a kind of case stu study of a particular kind of person. Er, er, a man who grows up under the shadow of his father, as it were. So it's quite an interesting, whatever you think about Woodrow Wilson in the First World War is quite a interesting book, in drawing a character study of the kind of person who Freud must have seen many times in his practice. The man who grows up idealizing his father, and whose relationship with his father is a largely passive one. So he tends to regard his father as a kind of ideal he can never equal, and tends if anything to identify with er, with his own mother, and play a kind of passive role to his, to his father. And this is how Freud explains Wilson's inability to stand up to the other men, like Woodrow, like Cle Clements or Lloyd George, who were rather aggressive, and er, were, were kind of pushing all the time, what they could out of the, out of the peace settlement, and what, er the book shows, is that Woodrow Wilson would have confrontations with them and say a lot of fine words, and then the next day, he would, he would give it all away, as it were, he would, he would be ill or he'll backtrack, or when the actual agreements came to be signed, he, he wouldn't do what he said he would, er,wh what he did. So Freud has to explain this weakness of Wilson, in the face of erm, these much more dominant aggressive men he was up against in these very hard er hitting negotiations, about what to do about the world after, after World War One. So, Freud's view is that he was, this passive erm nature of, of, of, retiring er nature of, of Woodrow Wilson, which explains his inte intellectuality as says, erm, Wilson was a very intellectual man. He had a great fondness for speeches and oratory. Apparently, in his childhood, he'd give speeches to an empty barn, er, had, would stand in the, in the family barn, erm, giving lectures to the hay, you know, and he, he, he loved this, and he, he was, he had a great erm sense of grandiloquent language and, Freud and Bullitt's interpretation is that, Woodrow Wilson, in a sense, was a typical politician. Very good at words, not so good at, at, at actions and actually delivering the goods as it were So, why, why do you ? Well, er I asked this, because erm, when I was having my house it came up, and I and I pointed out to her th the astonishing anomaly, I said, look erm, everybody knows about manuscript, Ernest and his biography of Freud mentions it and says he read it and reports rather well of it, actually, was really quite impressed with it. I said knew about it, erm, you must have known about it, erm, that standard edition of the complete psychological works of Freud, that's its title, and you're one of the editors, one of the editors, I said, there's no evidence that you ever intended to include this book in it, even though, you know, I understand that it couldn't be published as long as Woodrow Wilson's family was still alive, but erm, you know, why wasn't it published in the standard edition? And said I don't know. Now, she could have been lying. I don't think she would have told me a, a lie. When I asked her things like that, she didn't want to tell me on other occasions, she said I know that I can't tell you. Er, she was an honest person. I think that's what she would have said. If, if, if that had been the case, she'd say, oh, I do know, but I'm afraid I can't tell you. When she said, I don't know, I think she was telling me the truth, she didn't know. Erm, the fact is, she didn't play a dominant part in the standard tradition, although she was one of the editors, of course. Er, she was mainly one of the editors because she was erm, her father's, you know she even inherited her father's estate. So, so that was in her share of the management . I don't think she'd taken erm prominent role in the day to day planning of the standard edition, this was done by erm, calculable spreadsheet. So erm, I think when she said she didn't know, er, she was telling the truth, and when asked her if she could explain to me, the very point that just asked me, again she said she, she couldn't explain, she had, she she'd agreed, agreed it was a paradox, that she didn't really know erm, why the book had never been published, or until nineteen sixty seven erm note, note that it, that it had been taken. Erm, my only view is that, er, the reason is that, by the time it saw the light of day, because remember, the manuscript was in the, the manuscript was physically in the possession of the Bullitt family not the Freud family. Erm, when the Bullitt family sought it to published it, it was published, but by that time, the kind of changes that I talked about at the beginning of my lectures, had already occurred in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis had evolved into a highly therapeutic undertaking, which was very very and institutionalized for therapy, and the black books had already been blackened, as it were. People were already tending to ignore these very works we're looking at,theomonoism we'll be looking at next week, gonna tell us about that, aren't you . Yes. Another very black book, er, Civilization Discon these kind of books were, er, generally er, at, at er best ignored, at worst disparaged, by the psychoanalytic establishment. So when this book on, on Woodrow Wilson appeared, I mean, it gets even blacker. Er, particularly since it was only half right, or you couldn't exactly tell which half, not very clearly, so if it's half by Freud, and er, it was a book erm, on erm, a controversial figure arguing over very controversial pieces, and I think the psychoanalytic study didn't want to have anything to do with it, and er, er, one of the reviews of the psychoanalytic journal that said that this is the kind of book that gets psychoanalysis a bad name. And er, on the other side, the, the people interested in it in the social sciences, erm, didn't particularly like it, because, at that time, they were heavily dominated by er, Marxist and people on the left. I mean, I myself, for instance, after I'd published my first book on psychoanalysis in nineteen eighty was summoned to the House of Commons by and given a dinner, in the House of Commons Restaurant, which isn't very good actually, least it wasn't then, and effectively I was told by this great man was, noticed, had a very high opinion of his own ego, that erm, you know the left was in charge of psychoanalysis in this country, and had better conform or shut up. My views were not politically correct. And would I please stop publishing on psychoanalysis and leave it to my elders and betters. Like . So I er, I politely told him what he could do with that, well, I was eating his dinner and I couldn't be too rude to him, but erm, you know, when er when, when confronted, I don't give ground over that kind of thing. I said, you know, I'd every right to resume my own research, erm, if the Labour Party thought it owned psychoanalysis, I'm afraid I have, have to differ. So we, we parted on that note. But erm, the people like and the left, didn't like the book either, because it didn't tell their particular interpretation, as kind of left Marxist er, interpretation as someone has it, was so popular at the time. And so the book was just kind of, ignored I think, and left standing, and now it's out of print, and we've discovered this week, it's not even in the university library. Erm, it must have vanished, there was a copy there. Er, so it's, it, it's one of these strangely anomalous works, it, it's, it has spawned, I must admit, some very unfortunate literature, and I think 's own book is the worst example, but it's not the only one. There's a whole area of psycho-history. Has anybody read about psycho-history? There's a whole school of psycho- history mainly in the United States, not many followers here, and er, I must admit, I, I used to have er a class on psycho-history on this course, and I dropped it, and the reason was, I think students didn't find it very satisfactory, and the literature was of such poor quality. It really was er of the sort, you know, if Cleopatra's nose had been half an inch longer, history would have all been different, you know, that, that kind of trivia. Erm I think you can see that the problem with this kind of biographical approach to history is it can degenerate into trivia. Of the kind that himself wrote of . Which I think is, er, is one of the worst examples of trivial. Because, because clearly, you can see that in the social sciences, there is a big problem. If you think that individual people have a big role in history, like and Woodrow Wilson, I doubt if he did, I mean everybody would admit that these were important figures obviously, but the question is, how important were they, compared with social, political and economic factors, possibly beyond their control? I mean this is the big issue, isn't it? I thought, like, I mean, isn't the basic idea of psychoanalysis is that, you know that, that these people are repressing something and that's studying, and the question is how well, can you arrive at what they were repressing, by just sort of secondhand, you know, I mean Mm. wouldn't you, I mean, not as so best way to figure out what they were repressing, but just, I mean wouldn't you need to really have the whole life in front of you You would. to figure out? I mean, we urgently certainly we can psychoanalyse a group, you know, the group psy the group psychology, because we all understand how groups act, and we can say, oh, yes groups act like that, you do act like that, that makes sense and that can prove it, you know. But with, with a man, I mean, you really need to have every single incident in his life, to, to really know what That is absolutely true. Yes, this is another big problem I think you put that very well, that people forget, of course, that in clinical psychoan analysis the analyst has a vast amount of data, because the patient is going five times a week, or in Freud's case, six times a week, for fifty minutes every day, six days a week, nine months of the year, often for several years and er, the, the sheer amount of data that the analyst gets, is absolutely immense. I mean, I can well recall in my own analysis with , of course, for the first six months she said nothing, and I used to get very frustrated, and say, look, what do you think of this? What's your interpretation, she would say, oh, we don't know enough yet. She said I'm not sure. We'll have to wait and see. And for about six months, I didn't get anything. When interpretations were offered to me, she said so and so, and I said, why, and then she was ready. She said there was this female, that the other thing, and there was a whole long list of things that pointed to this interpretation, and it was all part of a, as you say a great mass of data, that erm, is, is quite mind-bogglingly large, if you actually erm, see it in words. Erm, it's very difficult, of course, to er, well it's impossible actually, to turn that into er written accounts. Because of course if you were to tape record analytic sessions, it would change that nature of the, of the analysis. And er, one of the big scientific problems with psychoanalysis is that privacy and confidentiality are prominent, as obviously in other areas of science, you can er, the demonstration has to be in public, as it were . I mean, other people can do the experiment or repeat it. Trouble with an individual psychoanalysis, it can never be. So one of the big problems with an historical figure, is that erm, you don't even have that much data to go on, the data you have is gonna inevitably be, be selective and limited. Again I think if Freud and Bullitt were here today, they'd say, well look we did, in fact, have quite a lot of data, because I, Bullitt knew Wilson intimately for several years and worked with him, and er, Freud had rarely the stuff in erm, in all papers of Woodrow Wilson in the library of Congress or wherever they were, and he had a great deal of data. But even so, 's point is a good one, that there isn't, there's seldom if ever enough this is a small problem in psychoanalysis, I myself hope to put right to some extent, and some of you may live long enough to see this happen, I hope you will. Er, that's why I'll tell you all, I even tell young people. There's no point in telling old people, because they'd be dead. But erm, there are one or two interesting exceptions to this, and one exception is myself, because er, I started analyzing myself through maybe to nineteen sixty nine, and with one or two small exceptions, like when I was being analyzed by and I didn't like it, with any doubt, my entire analysis was being written down. Erm, I guess now in fact, erm er, last few years is all er, is all er entered in data on computer. And it's my intention to keep up this analysis, er, for as long as it takes, probably to the end of my life. And that er, on the centenary of my birth, which will fall in two thousand and forty six, my heirs and executors will be free to er, release it to the world, on condition, however, that it's published complete and unexpurgated and unedited. In other words, if you're gonna have personal , you're gonna, it, you can't allow somebody to edit us out, as it were. And er, if and when it's published, there will be millions of words, I mean there are now, and I don't how large it is now, it's impossible to tell how large, erm, but just a couple of years, for example, amounts to over a quarter of a million words, so if you run that back to nineteen sixty nine, you see it is going to be one of the largest books ever written. And it maybe, if it's ever published, while we're still here in two thousand and forty six, and my executors do as I hope they will, erm, you know, it will be a book alongside Samuel Pepys, and Casanova and Saint Augustine, it's that length. My guess it's as least long as Samuel Pepys' diary, or will be. And I hope that, er, you know, this, all this data will be published, and people will be able to see just what the complete data is. And if that's the case, then in the middle of the next century, more will be known about me, than has ever been known about any other human being. Because I have faithfully stuck to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis. I have not held back anything. It's all true and it's all right. Of course, my own reputation will be the first victim of this. I will be universally despised. But that's okay, I mean I'm not particularly, I'm not so impressed with the human race that I, I, I think much of their opinion of me anyway. But erm, the great pity of course is, that Freud didn't do this. It's, I mean, Freud we know, did do a certain analysis. My guess is, he must have written an account. It's a great pity he didn't preserve any detail, and he looked, er, like all his other papers had been left in the library of Congress until two thousand and twenty five, and then they will all become public. Erm, that would have been er, really worth knowing . But as I've said, it will, it will be preserved in my case. Erm, it's my great contribution to science, unfortunately I shall be long dead, and many of yo some of you may, I don't know how many of you will still be alive in two thousand and forty six, but if you are, you may see this day. I won't of course. But it's a, it's a problem that, that you've put your finger on, and this is why I personally think that a lot of this literature is of such a poor quality. And certainly this stuff, I mean, when a person's still alive, how can you possibly know enough? You see, Woodrow Wilson was dead, Bullitt had access to a lot of private material that er, perhaps there's still,I don't know whether it's ever been published. And of course, Bullitt had directly observed the man and interacted with him during the critical time at, at the Versailles conference. And the whole book is really about er the Versailles conference in a way, isn't it, and about why he behaved the way he did at the time. So there's a kind of critical period here, that we have got a lot of information about. And in a sense, the book is very one dimensional in that it follows just this one aspect of Woodrow Wilson's character, the critical one. Now of course, in a, in a complete psychoanalysis, if Woodrow Wilson had been going for analysis, then all kinds of other aspects of his life and personality would have opened up. And you wouldn't get this concentration on one, this one kind of character defect, which er, admittedly, is a, is a problem with the book and, and can make it look as if it is a kind of character assassination. character assassination of Wilson? Erm, yes, perhaps. Mm. Yes, but Freud does er justify this er meaning, that this is why to form a psychological That's Because of his limitations I was gonna further say that erm, you know, beside lack of information itself,information of repression, information into someone's life I mean, repression necessarily I mean the, the thing that someone does in their lifetime might necessarily strange and distracted, and the purpose of the thing Well, yes, that, that's true but I think the, er, by the nineteen twenties, when Freud was writing this book, was it nineteen twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty nine, Er, well,certainly, yes. They started it, yes. Right, so they, sorry, the early nineteen thirties, when they started it. By that time, Freud certainly had moved on a bit, from the earlier, perhaps rather narrow concentration on the repression and he was moving into the second er era of psycho psychoanalysis when there was an emphasis more on the total personality on the ego and its mechanisms of defence, to quote a title of a famous book by , and I think this is more the kind of thing that Freud is doing in this book, where you, you see not just the repressions in the unconscious, but the whole personality, and you understand it, in terms of its various defensive erm, structures, and the way which it carried out its repression. In other words, you concentrate not just on what's repressed in id, but on the structure of the ego as well, and the superego, and the course of nature part of it comes out in the book as told us that Woodrow Wilson had a tremendous superego in the form of his identification with his father, who he further identified with God, I mean, if I come over very critical indeed, and therefore, his own ego was identified with Jesus Christ. And this, for example, I mean, whether we believe this or not, this Freud says, or thinks, explains why Wilson could come to Europe as a saviour, the saviour of mankind, but then failed to deliver the goods, because of the passive nature of his identification, you know, Jesus got crucified. Which was a pretty passive thing to do, in some ways, erm, and similarly, you could say Woodrow Wilson ended up crucified by the, by the allies. A certain fourteen points for cruci everybody must have that . And, erm, so this, it was, in a sense it was not so much as what was repressed in his ears, the structure of his ego that led to this unfortunate consequence. Does that answer your So it's part of this larger view of psychoanalysis that was emerging in the thirties. Where you could have more of a character study, rather than just the kind of erm, capping the unconscious, as it were Since like what you say, psychoanalysis was now, I mean, is it mostly centred on the ego? I mean, one , since you can't go if you don't Mm. would you say that, you know, in modern psychoanalysis presumably just not the, like the structure of the ego, and then they know Wh what, well,I, I wouldn't say just looking similar, I would say additionally looking, but, but in the, in the early days the erm, and I'll be saying something about this in the, in the lectures,bu but just briefly, that you could you could say there were phases in psychoanalysis, the early days, before both of us were born you were here, the, the aim when the method was , the aim was to release the unconscious, bring it to the surface, and that was regarded as more or less enough. Analyses in those days were short by modern standards. There's an example in my book, with one that only lasted six weeks, for example, which is astonishing by modern standards. After World War One, and especially by the nineteen thirties, the, the purview of psychoanalysis, as it were, had, had enlarged to include the ego, as we saw, and so, so what happened then was, the structure of the ego was explored and not just the repressions. In other words, it was the agencies that carried out the repressions that were analyzed, as well as the repressions themselves. This is a much more like a, a kind of total dissection of the personality. It means that psychoanalysis takes a lot longer, because you are looking at defences and ego as well as at, at the . You get a much more complete picture. Analogy I used in my book, was actually suggested to me by , although this is a ana a kind of metaphor that, that her father was very fond of. Erm, was with archaeology. But in the nineteenth century, archaeology was a kind of treasure-troving erm, explorers, a kind of raid on, on the very past, to discover the treasure. That's what psychoanalysis was like in its first days. We raided the unconscious, as it were, to, to liberate the repressed and, and, and understand what was in that. Modern archaeology is much more scientific and it's, it tends to excavate entire layers, layer, by layer and every little thing is relevant, you know, they, the little pot shard, erm, even bits of excrement, apparently are very interesting to archaeologists, because they're sure people were eating, and things like this, er, you know, remnants of fire was charcoal, everything. All of this is, is just good as well as bits of gold and er and, and you know metal objects, that have always traditionally been interesting to archaeologists. And that's rather like modern analysis, everything is interesting. It's not just what is repressed, it's the structures of the ego that bring about these repressions, the identifications and so on. So it's a more complete er picture, of, of, of the personality, and of course it lends itself to this kind of historical portraiture . Because as says, er, the unconscious is, as a sense, is always hidden, so how do you possibly find out about the unconscious of historical figures that are dead and gone? Well, the answer is with very very great difficulty. But if you were looking at their egos as well, er their whole personality had its defence disrupted, then of course , you may be able to see a bit more, because you are now looking at areas which are co both conscious and manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. Does that answer your, your point? Yeah, I suppose I was thinking, I, I always get mixed up when you say psychoanalysis Mm. I just want to you know modern days was just confusing me and er, all this sort of thing. Whereas I think it easy, you know sometimes I get confused about what's what Right. So, when, when I talk about psychoanalysis in this course, I mean mainly Freudian classical, because it's Freud's writings we're looking at. Admittedly, another aspect of the whole thing, as you rightly say, is that there's been a burgeoning and a lot of different schools, and of course different schools give emphasis to different, different kinds of things. And that's a further complicating factor, of course. Well, it's just coming up to eleven o'clock, who haven't we heard from, er, right, you've been very very quiet there. There. Have you got anything, any comments you want to say about this? I mean, I didn't read the book. No. No. Er, I must admit I point Freud makes,slightly arrogant erm, I mean it, he's, he's, he's a Yeah.

Still they did not make a sound, but used every effort to escape. There was no thought of trying to save anything but their lives. That was the one mercy that was asked of God. Other possessions could be replaced. On, on they flew. Thank God, the door is almost within reach. They gasp for breath. Even Duke pants. Will their strength last until they can reach God's pure air? Maggie now proved leader. Her trembling hands unbarred the door that alone stood between them and liberty. With a last mighty effort, she swung it open. Out they flew, and now the flames which curled in wild fury about the piazza almost scorched them. Thank God, this fiery trial is but for a moment. They dash through the flames, and are safe. Breathing is no longer a pain. They make their way beyond the reach of the sparks. Maggie fell on her knees crying: "Praise to de Lo'd. Praise to de Lo'd." Julia looked at the piazza down which she had wished to climb. "Beth, if we had tried to come that way we couldn't have done it," she said, and there was thankfulness in her heart that she had conquered her fear. Otherwise precious time would have been lost, and she might have been burned to death. "Our home is gone," sobbed Beth, for at that instant the roof fell. Duke howled as if he, too, knew that something had been lost that never again could be exactly the same. His howls attracted Beth's attention. "You dear, dear fellow," she cried, the tears flowing faster than ever. "If it hadn't been for you we'd all be dead." He poked his nose into her outstretched hand, and looked up at her as if he would like to comfort her. At that instant Harvey and Gustus rushed upon the scene. "Beth, Beth," cried Harvey wildly. "We're here," she answered. Tears of thankfulness rushed into the eyes of Harvey and Gustus, and for once they were not ashamed of crying. "Beth," repeated Harvey, running up to her and seizing her hands. His emotion choked back the words that rose. Never had he been more grateful, and never had he less power of expression. "Little missy, I done feared yo'd went up in de flames," cried Gustus, and added, "but I had dat dar grain of mustard seed dat made me b'lieve de Lo'd would somehow save yo'." "Somehow, even when I'm awfully scared, I don't think I'm going to be killed," said Beth. "I jes' reckon yo' has dat grain of mustard seed I'se tellin' 'bout." "I reckon it's a good thing to have, Gustus," put in Harvey. "But instead of letting the mustard seed do everything by itself, I believe we'd better rouse the servants. Unless care is taken their quarters and the barn may burn." [Illustration: The darkies' quarters.] This proved a happy suggestion; for while these buildings were far distant from the house, it was found the sparks had already set the barn afire. However, the servants managed to put the fire out. The glare from the fire illuminated the sky, and attracted the attention of the Davenports and the Gordons returning in a merry mood from the party. "It looks like a house burning," said Mrs. Davenport. "Supposing it were ours," she added forebodingly. Mr. Davenport had experienced a like fear for some moments, but had refrained from letting any of the party know. They had remarked that he was driving the spirited span to their full speed, but supposed he was hurrying because of the lateness of the hour. "It is a fire," cried Mrs. Gordon. "Our daughters--God keep them." Moments seemed hours to the anxious parents. As dread became certainty, they felt as if the horses were almost standing still, whereas they were going as fast over the hard shell road as was possible. Ambulance or fire horses could not have passed the ones Mr. Davenport drove, urged both by his voice and by the whip. "Beth--Julia," cried two mothers the same second, as they rushed from the carriage and gathered two blanketed figures to their hearts. Tears of relief and thankfulness flowed thick and fast. "It's terrible that our lovely home is gone," cried Beth. "In evil there is good. You are safe, my darling," her mother murmured. The fathers felt no less keenly the escape of their beloved children, but expressed themselves less emotionally. Marian could get hardly any one to notice her, but finally managed to say so as to be heard: "I don't think they ought to be standing around with bare feet, and blankets wrapped around them." "You must all come home with us," cried Mrs. Gordon. "I will not accept a refusal. We have a great abundance of room." Already the fire was beginning to die down, and Mr. Davenport saw that no good could be accomplished by remaining longer. "January, I want you to watch to see that no damage is done by sparks," he said. "Sparks won't have no sort of chance wid me aroun', massa." Room was made in the carriage for the two children, and the horses were started in the direction of the Gordon homestead. For a few moments, in the excitement of telling about the fire, Beth forgot all about Duke. They were almost at the Gordons' door when she thought of him. She looked hastily back, half hoping he might be following, and to her joy saw him directly behind the carriage. Beth pleaded to be allowed to take her beloved dog up to Julia's room with them. Julia added her entreaties, and the children were permitted to do as they wished in the matter. Once the children were in bed, they talked awhile of their fortunate deliverance. Duke came in for a big share of praise. Then Julia fell asleep, but Beth felt very wide awake. Presently, even Duke on the floor near their bed also slept. Beth knew that he was sleeping because he moaned as if he were haunted by a nightmare of the fire. "Poor, poor fellow, he feels almost as bad as I," thought Beth. For a long time she lay awake wondering what her father would do now that their home with all its contents was burned. "Just s'posing--just s'posing----" With these words Beth fell into a troubled sleep. About ten minutes afterwards, she began crying in her sleep, which wakened Julia. "Why, Beth dear, what's the matter?" and Julia twined her arm lovingly around her friend. Beth wakened with a start. She sat up in bed. "Where am I, Julia? In Florida?" "Of course, dear. What made you----" "Oh, I'm so glad I'm here. I went to sleep s'posing----" "Supposing what, Beth?" "Oh, I don't like to tell for fear it may come true. I dreamed that it did come true and it made me very miserable." "You're just nervous over the terrible fire. All the bad that can happen has already happened to you." "I don't know about that," murmured Beth, but could not be persuaded to tell Julia more about her dream. Julia therefore sank back into slumberland, and forgot all about her friend's dream, but not so Beth. The fear of what she dreamed haunted her, waking and sleeping. The next morning, Beth had quite a time dressing. Most of Julia's clothes proved a very tight fit. "I'll have to pretend I'm a young lady. Then I shall not mind if it is tight," Beth said as she struggled into Julia's blue dress. "It's a little short, but then short dresses are the style now," commented Julia in an effort to be polite. Immediately after breakfast, the Davenports and the Gordons started over to view the fire. For some reason known only to herself, Beth did not care to go. She even refused to be moved by Julia's entreaties, and insisted that Julia go without her. Duke remained to keep Beth company. When the two were alone, Beth put her arms around the faithful dog. He looked up into her eyes and whined. "I believe you know," cried Beth. "Are you afraid of it, too?" Again Duke whined. "You do know, Duke." There were tears in Beth's eyes. "If it happens, they'll take you from me. Don't you remember what Mr. Brown said?" Duke looked as if he understood. "They shan't take you from me. I'll go in town and see Mr. Brown. You shall go with me, Duke." He wagged his tail as if pleased, at the promise. Beth ran for a hat, and then, with Duke, started down the road towards town. The day was extremely sultry, and the warmth in combination with the excitement of the night before soon caused Beth to tire, but she would not give up her undertaking. "You'd do as much to stay with me, wouldn't you, Duke?" she asked, to encourage herself. Duke barked. Perhaps it was because he did not mind the heat and was anxious for a frolic. Beth envied his spirits. To her the way seemed very long and dusty, but on and on she trudged. She did not know exactly where Mr. Brown lived, but thought by asking she could easily find out, and so it proved. It was a very tired, warm, and dusty little girl who finally turned in at the Browns'. A great, overgrown puppy rushed at Beth and Duke as they opened the gate. At first, Beth could hardly believe her own eyes. It scarcely seemed possible that it was the same puppy she had given Mr. Brown such a short time before. The little fellow had outgrown all his brothers and sisters, and could no longer be rightly termed little. Duke was unaffectedly glad to see his son. Away they ran together. "Duke, Duke, come back." Beth's call did not bring him, but Mr. Brown came around the corner of the house. "Why, missy," his face lighted up in greeting. Beth wondered how she ever thought him ugly-looking. "You saw my puppy, didn't you? I tell you he's a fine fellow. Duke never compared with him." "Do you really like the puppy the best?" cried Beth, eagerly rushing up to him in her excitement. "Not a doubt of it." He smiled at her evident delight. "Gift----" "Is that what you call him?" "Yes. The name is to remind me of your kindness. I----" "Was I really kind?" she interrupted wistfully. She did not wait for an answer. "Then perhaps you'd be willing to do me a very, very great favor." "What is it you want? But you'd better sit down first. You look tired." "I am a little tired. It was pretty hot walking." "You don't mean you walked here?--and on such a hot day?" When he found that she had, he seated her in the shade on the cool piazza, and would not listen to another word until he went into the house and returned with a bottle of orangeade for her. "Now while you drink, I'll tell you why I like Gift better than Duke. In the first place, Gift really loves me--why, I don't believe that even such a charming little lady as you could get Gift to leave me. Let's try and see. Here, Gift; come, Gift." The two dogs came running at his call. "He always answers just so promptly." Beth noted how proud he looked. "Now little missy, call Gift and make friends with him." Beth did as bidden. Gift proved very friendly in response. Duke seemed inclined to be jealous. "Now missy, rise as if to go and call Gift to follow. It will be as big a temptation as he ever had. He doesn't usually make friends the way he has with you and Duke. Perhaps I'm a fool to try him so." "Then I will not----" "No, no. I want to know if Gift cares for me as much as I think he does. You must try him." Beth was growing nervous over the situation. Somehow, she realized that the love of Gift meant more to the man before her than almost anything in his life. If the dog failed him at this point it might have a very disastrous effect. "Come, come; do as I say," cried Brown with somewhat of his original curtness of manner. Beth did not dare refuse, but trembled for the result. She arose. Duke wagged his tail in delight that she was going. "Come on, Gift." He paid no heed, but his master saw that she was not calling as if she really wanted the dog. "Call as if you meant it." She saw that she could not fool him. She felt compelled to act under his direction, but it seemed the irony of fate that once she had unwittingly taken his dog from him, and that now she should be made to try again when neither of them wished the dog to leave him. Tears were in her eyes, but she clapped her hands as if ready for a frolic. "Come on, Gift; come on." Duke also barked an invitation. Gift leaped down the steps and was by their side in an instant. "Oh, please call him back, or let me come back." "Go on. Don't you dare let him see that you don't want him. If he follows you home, I never want to see any of you again. Both dogs then are yours forever," growled Gift's owner. Tears now blinded poor Beth so that she could hardly see to open the gate. Duke did not wait for it to be opened, but leaped over the fence. Gift hesitated about following. He was perfectly able to make the jump, but he evidently thought of his master for the first time. He looked back undecided what to do. "Oh, if he only would call him," but Brown stood as if turned to stone. Suddenly Gift ran back to his side. Beth never felt more grateful. "Call him. I am not sure of him yet," cried Brown in a strange voice. "It's cruel to the dog and to me," thought Beth. She now held the gate open. "Come, Gift." Again Duke barked. "I'm ashamed of you, Duke Davenport, for tempting your own son," thought Beth. Gift looked up at his master as if for a word of instruction. He received no word or sign in reply. Then Gift made a slight move as if to follow Beth, but suddenly turned and licked his master's hand. Next, he settled down on the porch for a sleep as if the matter were settled once and forever. Beth now expected to see Mr. Brown show some emotion, but he simply called, "Missy, come back." She would have thought that she had overestimated his feelings in the matter if she had not caught sight of tears in his eyes when she returned. "Gift is the best friend I have," he said quietly when Beth was reseated. "Do you know he helps keep me from saloons. If he is with me and I start in one, he growls. Now, what favor do you want to ask of me?" She had almost forgotten the object of her visit, and the abruptness with which it was recalled to her embarrassed her. "I--I want to pay you for Duke. I have some money of my own in the bank and I think----" "But I gave Duke to you." He looked grieved. "I accepted Gift from you, I don't see----" "You don't understand. Do you remember what you said when you gave me Duke? You said if I ever left Florida I'd have to give him back to you." "That was before I had Gift." "And you wouldn't take Duke from me?" She sprang to her feet. "Not for the world." Suddenly Beth seized Duke, and danced around and around with him. "Oh, goody. Duke, you old dear, we needn't stay awake nights worrying over that part any more." Mr. Brown hitched up and drove Beth back. On the way, she told him of the fire, and how Duke had saved their lives. Duke and Gift were following the carriage, and perhaps Duke was telling his son of his own heroism, because Gift often barked as if excited over something. Mr. Brown said he would like to see the ruins and so Beth drove with him to the homestead. They found Mr. Davenport, Julia, Harvey, Maggie, and Gustus out near the stables. "Why Beth, where have you been?" cried her father. She jumped out of the carriage and ran and threw herself into her father's arms. "Papa, now that our house is gone, I was afraid you'd take us back North to live. I don't want to go, but if I had to go, it would have broken my heart to part with Duke, but now, I'll never, never have to part with him, no matter what happens. Mr. Brown says he's mine forever." "Dear, I do not expect to go back North. Next fall, we'll build a fine new house, and you shall be a little Florida lady the rest of your life, if you wish." "I'm to live South always," cried Beth, turning a radiant face toward her friends. "Three cheers for our little Florida lady," proposed Harvey. All present joined in the hurrahing that followed. Gustus's voice rang out the loudest of any. Beth's face was radiant. The sun was shining once more for her. Her two great fears had proved groundless. Duke was hers, and henceforth she was to remain A Little Florida Lady. = = = PG32553 = = = A LITTLE FRECKLED PERSON: A BOOK OF CHILD VERSE E-text prepared by Juliet Sutherland, Jennifer Sahmoun, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file which includes the original illustrations.

They do not know a princess oft In golden gown am I, With cheeks like apple petals soft And eyes like sea or sky. They only see my tumbled braids, They do not know I wear A crown with turquoises and beryls Upon my coiled-up hair. They do not know adventures dire Beset me, land and sea, That page and courtier, knight and squire, Before me bend the knee. That haughty ships with silken sails Upon my bidding go-- All these, and other happy things, They cannot, cannot know. They only see a little girl At study, work, or play,-- A little freckled person, who Has never much to say! THE SELFISH SEA The sea is very, very wide: It takes up all the room outside; And when I stand beside the sea, It comes right up and pushes me! THE RABBIT A rabbit works its ears, and tries To watch you with its rabbit eyes; Its saucy little tail it flounces, And when it hits the ground it bounces! [Illustration: A RABBIT WORKS ITS EARS, AND TRIES TO WATCH YOU WITH ITS RABBIT EYES] THE UNCRITICAL KITTEN If I am selfish when I play My kitten likes me anyway! NEXT-DOOR PEOPLE The next-door people have a bird, The yellowest you ever heard! It hops, and chirps, and sings--and sings! Aren't next-door people pleasant things! PROBATION Mother says: If you're thoughtful and polite; Go to bed at eight each night; Always hasten to do chores And give up chairs for visitors, Weed the garden, carry wood, And be very still and good-- Mother says: If you're faithful in your task; Never beg, but only ask; Fold your napkin, say your prayers; Put no gum upon the chairs; Keep your bureau drawer quite neat; Never walk through pools, but on The sidewalk till the mud is gone; And say "Thank you" often, and Sit erect and walk and stand; And wash well behind your ears; Always wait until it clears To wear your best clothes, and not fail To hang your coat upon its nail-- You will find the people where You live, like to have you there! * * * * * Our house has a pleasant yard. I am trying very hard! [Illustration: WEED THE GARDEN, CARRY WOOD] PERHAPS! You never know, in this great world, what wonders there may be-- Perhaps there's buried treasure out beneath our cherry tree! 'FRAID STARS The stars are like us children here, Not any older grown: At night, the little 'fraid stars stay Together in the Milky Way-- The brave ones stand alone! THE STARS The stars are lighted candles Upon a Christmas tree; (The branches, that they hang upon We cannot ever see:) On Christmas Eve the angels stand About it after tea. And if an angel's very good He gets a present, as he should. AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY Of course I believe in fairies! Of course I know they're true! --Just think, if you were a fairy, And no one believed in you! DRAWING Upon my slate I draw Strange things I never saw, Nor you, nor any one! But oh, it is such fun! THE FISHING-POLE A fishing-pole's a curious thing: It's made of just a stick and string: A boy at one end and a wish; And on the other end a fish! SYMPATHY Little fishing-boat, a blur On the ocean blue, Don't you ever wish you were A little taller, too? I've a birthday! Look at me As you dart and dip! Grow, and maybe soon you'll be A white-sailed ship! THE FOREST SCHOOL The little firs demurely stand In studious rows, on either hand, On winter days about like these, All learning to be Christmas trees. WHITE CHERRY The moon's a white cherry, For sale in the sky, And each one admires it, But no one will buy. Oh, cherry that lies On the shop-window shelf, When I have a penny I'll buy you myself! THE INDEPENDENT KITE A kite is very nice to own; It never, never grieves you, 'Cept when it wants to play alone And just goes off and leaves you! PRACTICING The black notes are the bridegrooms, The white notes are the brides! And I? Why, I'm the minister and all the guests besides! FAIRYLAND SECRET SERVICE A snowflake is a letter A fairy in the sky Is sending to the fairies here, And, when they've read its message clear, Lest any one should spy, They purse their little lips and blow To melt that tell-tale note of snow. Oh, let us see if we can snatch And read a Fairyland dispatch! A BOOK A book's a magic sort of thing That makes you sailor, chief, or king; When I am old, and own a shelf, I think I'll have a book myself! THE LONESOME SEA The sea is so lonely Now winter is here, I wish we could only Go down to the pier, And say to him kindly, "Don't think, Mr. Sea, We've forgotten you quite, for we haven't, not we! "Last summer we scurried All sudden, I know, From the beach. Don't be worried! We hated to go!" I should like to go clear to the end of the pier, For he's lonesome; and tell him, "We're coming next year!" THE MOUNTAINS The mountains do not stir, or show Emotion when Spring comes, I know; But though they are restrained by pride, I think that they are glad inside! WHEN DOLLY IS AFRAID When lights are standing in the street; And on the sidewalk all the feet Are quiet, and it's growing late, And our brown clock is striking eight: I pack the animals and ark, And push them deep into the dark; And in a quiet row I lay My cups and saucers 'til the day. But who could ever say Good-night And leave her doll in such a plight? I couldn't let her stay without A friend, and hear the dark about! So she and I go straight upstairs; She shuts her eyes while we say prayers, And then we lie and count up sheep Until we both are fast asleep. It's not because I dread, at all, The darkness, that I keep my doll, But just because I think that she Would be _so_ frightened without _me_! TREE-CHILDREN The little trees that to the breeze Make quaint and timorous courtesies: I like to come and play with these. Each grown-up pine that stands in line Is but a stranger great and fine-- The _little_ trees are friends of mine! THE COCKATOO Green and yellow cockatoo, Won't you let me talk to you? Or if you would kinder be Won't you come and talk to me? Tell me all about the places Where the children have black faces, Armlets, anklets, copper rings! Where the cannibals are kings! Has a hungry crocodile Ever met you with a smile? Have you taken many a trip In a rakish pirate ship? Cockatoo, cockatoo, How I'd like to talk to you! But as you can guess, I'd be Gladder if you'd talk to me! HIGH COST OF LIVING Among the angels--it's a shame To tell it--prices are so dear, They use the blown-out candle-flame To mend the ragged stars, this year! NEED I like the kitten of my friends, I like its claws caught in my lace, I like the way each small ear ends, I like the black upon its face. I feel its heart beat in my hand, And then I somehow understand So many things I didn't know: I'm kinder, and my voice is low; And I close doors more softly, too, And do the things I'm told to do, Instead of wishing they were done. --But mother says we mayn't have one. I want a kitten all my own To play with when I'm left alone, And when the family's gone away To shop, and work, and call, and play Tennis and other things. It's all So queer and lonely in the hall And in the parlor, too, and in The sitting-room, where words have been But are not now. The chairs and I Wait through the hours, till by-and-by, Our only playmates little fears-- There's room in all our lives, I think, For one small kitten, black as ink With two white spots behind its ears. [Illustration: I LIKE THE KITTEN OF MY FRIENDS] SKY-COLOR Blue skies are very apt to fade; Dark colors wear the best, it's true-- But who would choose a useful shade? I want mine blue! LEFT OUT If shoemakers' children are left with feet bare I've wondered and wondered (I don't think it's fair) If maybe at Christmas there aren't any toys Left over for Santa Claus' own girls and boys! THE WHITE BIRCH A white birch grows In the deepest wood. If you are good And the stars are right --Who knows?-- You may see, some night, The nymphs stand under The sea-green heave Of its boughs, in a row. --But if you wonder, They will fade and go. --You must just believe! THE PLAYMATE Last year I played with the country, This year, with the sea, Now the queer old city Stops and plays with me.-- Stops in its counting of pennies (It never, never fails To know the time I'm going to bed)-- And tells me fairy tales. THANKSGIVING The turkey is a mournful bird From all that I have ever heard; If he could live this day to see How very thankful he would be! THE NEST That tree has a nest, And if I lie Quite still, and if I Have luck, I may see Two heads or three Stretched out. Hark! hark! Wings sound! And a dark Shadow comes flying Through boughs. They are trying To reach the food that the large bird brings. Unfinished wings Are such curious things! They are almost old enough to fly, The three. If they knew As I do, and you, That nests are cozier than the sky! [Illustration: UNFINISHED WINGS ARE SUCH CURIOUS THINGS] THE ORANGE The sky is a greedy child Who holds one Yellow orange in her hand: It is the sun. She holds it primly: Then, hid from sight, All in the darkness, Eats it at night. I ALMOST GOT TO FAIRYLAND ONE DAY-- I almost got to Fairyland, one day-- I walked out straight along the sun-path, so. And there were little hummings in the world, And moving things went through the grass, and all The air was just as glad as if there were A party, somewhere, at a fairy's house. I knew they had a party, and I knew That they had kept a seat for me, if I Could only find the right turn in the road. I was so near to Fairyland, so near That I could almost hear the fairy gates Swing open for me, waiting--just for me. I was so near to Fairyland--and then, Just then, I heard my mother calling me; "Come well for you to laugh at Corporal Wilkes; but faith, my boy, we’ll have to court-martial you for deserting his Majesty’s stores, to say nothing of my best pair of galligaskins. Begorra, let’s hope they won’t fit the spalpeen of a Frenchman who gets them. The whole mess is rejuced to one suit." Then, changing his tone, the captain proceeded to inform Jack of what had happened since his arrival at Benavente. The inhabitants of the town had received the British army with an attitude of sullen dislike and even animosity. Relying for their rations on what could be obtained during the march, the troops had come into the place tired and hungry, to find the doors barred and food withheld. The shops were all closed, the magistrates had taken flight, and although the British were prepared to pay for supplies, neither bread nor wine was to be had. The men were already embittered by the hardships of their long march, and disappointed of their hopes of meeting the French in fair fight, and it was small wonder that coldness where they might well have looked for warmth, and aversion where they might have claimed active friendship, provoked resentment and reprisal. They were received as enemies; they could scarcely be expected to act as friends. "Indade, the whole army’s going to the dogs," said Captain O’Hare dejectedly; "all except the Gyards and the Reserve. Things are as bad as they can be, and there’s worse to come. The main body’s looting, and behaving worse than Pagans and Turks. They should be at Astorga by now, and we’re to follow them in an hour or so. The company’s falling in, and you’d better hurry up, or you run a risk of finding an escort like our friend Wilkes. And bedad," he added, as the dull sound of firing was heard in the direction of the river, "there’s the music again." Jack had by this time finished his breakfast, and, hurrying out with the captain, he found the 95th preparing to move off. "Hullo!" cried Smith, "you’ve turned up, then! What have you done with the wagon?" "Where are my boots?" asked Pomeroy. "And my best frilled shirt, the one with the ruffles?" continued Smith. "And my new highlows, the ones with the silver buckles?" added Pomeroy. "They are coming after us," returned Jack. "If you care to wait they’ll probably be here in half an hour—and Colbert’s dragoons inside them." As the regiment moved off, the firing behind them became more and more distinct and continuous. Bodies of mounted troops could be seen on the horizon; a smart cavalry action was apparently being fought, and the men of the 95th were again jealous of what they considered the better luck of the cavalry. But Jack’s company, marching away at the quick step, was soon beyond sight of the combatants, though for an hour afterwards the boom of guns could be plainly heard. Lord Paget was fighting one of those brilliant little rear-guard actions that stamped him in an age of great soldiers as one of the finest cavalry leaders of his time. At Benavente he had to deal, not with the ruck of Napoleon’s cavalry, who, be it said to their credit, were never wanting in dash, but with the flower of the emperor’s troops, the famous Cavalry of the Guard, led in person by Lefebvre-Desnouettes, his favourite general, who had been until now the spoiled child of fortune. When Lefebvre-Desnouettes discovered that the bridge across the Esla was broken beyond possibility of immediate repair, he rode fuming up and down the river, vainly seeking a practicable ford for the large body of infantry that had now gathered on the banks. On the farther side was a thin chain of British vedettes; beyond these, as far as the eye could reach across the great plain, there was no sign of Sir John Moore’s army except a few belated camp-followers hurrying into Benavente. The French general, chafing with impatience, at last flung prudence to the winds and decided to follow up the pursuit with his cavalry alone, leaving the infantry to follow as soon as the bridge could be patched up. Fording the swollen river with 600 chasseurs of the Guard at a spot some distance above the ruined arches, he drove back the vedettes in his front and pushed rapidly across the plain in the direction of Benavente. Meanwhile the news of the crossing had brought the British vedettes at full gallop from their posts opposite the fords below and above the bridge; and when a few score had collected they made a plucky charge at the head of the French column, and in spite of their small numbers threw it into disorder. The discomfited chasseurs, supported by the succeeding squadrons, rallied and pursued the audacious little band; but they were again broken by a second charge, led in person by General Stewart, who had come up with a few reinforcements. The British troopers broke clean through the first line, and although they narrowly escaped being cut off by the main body, they hewed their way out again and retired in good order towards Benavente. They were only two hundred, the French were three times their number, and Lefebvre-Desnouettes, irritated by these checks, incautiously pressed them into the outskirts of the town. There Lord Paget, with the 10th Hussars, lay grimly in waiting. Forming up his men under cover of some buildings, he held them, straining at the leash, until the chasseurs were well within striking distance, then he let them loose, and the hussars, instantly joined by Stewart’s pickets, rode at the enemy at a headlong, irresistible gallop. The leading squadrons of chasseurs went down like ninepins; the rest wheeled about, galloped back to the Esla, and did not draw rein until they were safe on the French side of the stream. Lefebvre-Desnouettes himself rode his horse at the river, but the animal had received a wound and refused to face the water. While still floundering at the brink, it was seized by an enterprising British trooper; the general was captured with seventy of his men, and Napoleon was left chafing at the first decisive check he had personally met with in Spain. Meanwhile there was growing dissatisfaction in the ranks of the British infantry, and even among the officers. It had been stated, with some show of authority, that Moore intended to make a stand at Astorga, but no one believed it; a similar statement had been made so many times before, always to be falsified. Some of the more clear-headed among the rank and file endeavoured to prove to their discontented comrades that the retreat was inevitable; Moore was no coward, and only the knowledge that he was overwhelmingly outmatched would have induced him to retire without giving battle. He had nothing personally to gain by running away; his military reputation was at stake, and he had further the duty of showing that Britain honourably stood by her pledges to Spain. It was a bitter disappointment to him, and nothing but a strong sense of responsibility had actuated his decision to march to the sea. Unhappily a retreating army is always prone to get out of hand. Already marauding had taken place at various stages of the march, and the sullen incivility of the Spaniards provoked ill-tempered words and deeds on the part of the British. The road was encumbered with stragglers, as well as with numbers of women and children, who suffered from the inevitable hardships of a march through wild country in mid-winter. The confusion and disorder were only increased when the troops reached Astorga. There they met the ragged Spanish regiments of the Marquis of La Romana, who, in spite of Moore’s repeated requests that he would retreat northwards into the Asturias, had marched westward into Galicia, giving as his reason that the only available pass into the former province was blocked with snow. In retreating before Soult his rear-guard had been cut to pieces by Franceschi’s dragoons at the bridge of Mansilla, where there had been every opportunity of making a stubborn resistance. They arrived at Astorga in a state of panic, more like a crowd of peasants driven from their homes than a regular army. They were half-naked, and half-starved; many were suffering from a malignant fever, and they were maddened by cold, disease, and want. Learning that large supplies of food lay at Astorga, as well as stores of shoes, blankets, and muskets, they prowled through the town, seizing whatever they could lay hands on, setting an example which too many of the British soldiers showed themselves ready to follow. When, on the evening of December 30th, Jack’s company marched into Astorga, they found disorder reigning everywhere within its ancient turreted walls. Several houses were on fire, men were plundering on every side, all kinds of objects were littering the streets. Three divisions of Moore’s army had already left the town on the way to Villafranca, and the only British troops now quartered there were the Reserve under General Paget and the two light brigades. These had kept better discipline than most of the regiments which had preceded them, and the signs of havoc provoked a great burst of indignation from the rear companies of the 95th as they swung round into the great square. Corporal Wilkes was especially voluble in denunciation of the bad discipline among the Spaniards. He was expressing himself warmly to Bates as they kept step together, when the sight of a tall Spanish soldier in somewhat better trim than the tatterdemalion rank and file of La Romana’s forces added fuel to his wrath. The men were standing near the lighted door of the Town Hall, where Jack’s company was to be quartered, and the Spaniard looked with a cynical smile at the Riflemen defiling past. He had a villainous countenance, its forbidding aspect enhanced by the fact that he had only one eye, which was gazing at the men with a fixed, stony, unwinking stare. "What’s that one-eyed villain of a Don doing there?" growled Wilkes, staring into the solitary eye as he passed. "Why ain’t he keeping his men in order, instead of loafing about like a London whitewasher out o’ work?" Jack heard the remark, and turned to look at the one-eyed man; but a scuffle between a man of the 28th and a squalid Spaniard drew off his attention for a moment, and when the quarrel was ended by the Englishman’s fist, the man had disappeared. After the men had been safely got to quarters Jack was sitting in the room he was to share with Pomeroy and Shirley when he was summoned to the Casa Morena. He there found Colonel Beckwith vigorously haranguing a Spanish officer, and was called on to act as interpreter. Beckwith was insisting in no measured terms that the officer should make some attempt to check the disorder among his men, and Jack did his best to soften the colonel’s language without depriving it of its authority. At the close of the interview, about eight o’clock at night, he was returning to his quarters when he fancied he heard a cry proceeding from a large house that stood alone, and by its size seemed to belong to a person of some importance. He stopped and listened; the cry was not repeated; he was passing on, when out of the darkness a little boy ran up, seized his hand, and began to pull him towards the house. "Señor! Señor!" he cried in a terrified wail, "my father—he is being murdered. He is an old man; he cannot fight. Come, Señor, and save him!" Jack had broken from the boy’s clutch and was already making with long strides to the front door. It was firmly barred and unyielding to his pressure. "Not that way, not that way, Señor!" cried the boy, and seizing Jack’s hand again, he led him to the back, through a narrow enclosure, to a flight of stone steps, at the head of which was a French window with one of its halves open inwards, and a dim light shining through. Running with the boy up the steps, Jack found himself in what was evidently the sala of the house. It was in darkness, but a door at the far end giving on to a corridor was open, and a dim light filtered into the room from a lamp, consisting of a shallow bowl in which a wick was floating on oil. Treading very warily, the two crossed the room to the corridor beyond; at the end of the passage a brighter light was streaming from a half-open door, and Jack, alert to catch the slightest sound, heard a rasping voice say in Spanish: "Now, you old dotard, I will give you one minute by yonder clock. After that the knife, and I will search for myself." Pushing the boy behind him, and signing to him to be quiet, Jack crept cautiously to the door and peeped into the room. Tied to a chair, with a rope cut from the bell-pull, was an old gentleman, very frail and thin, with sparse gray hair and beard. On the table before him a long knife, driven into the wood, rocked to and fro with diminishing oscillation; an angular man in Spanish uniform, his back half-turned to the door, occupied a chair within a couple of feet of the victim, and, leaning forward, elbows upon his knees, gazed with a vengeful smile into the old man’s face. At the side of the room a large escritoire lay open, its contents thrown pell-mell upon the floor. The old Spaniard, bound and helpless as he was, looked steadily with unflinching gaze into the face of his enemy. "Do you think for a moment, wretch that you are," he said with quiet scorn, his tone strangely contrasting with the fury of the other, "do you think for a moment that you will cajole me with empty promises, or scare me with insolent threats? I expect no mercy from you—you were always a villain,—but I can at least baulk your greed. I am an old man, do your worst; your knife has no terrors for me." The man, springing to his feet, snatched the knife from the table, and lifted his hand to strike; but Jack had already sprung into the room. The sound of Jack’s step arrested the villain’s movement; he half-turned to meet the intruder, disclosing as he did so the distorted features of a man with one eye. Even at that tense moment Jack connected him vaguely in thought with some previous experience, but there was no pause in his action. Before the man had time to wheel completely round, Jack struck him a blow on the chin that felled him to the floor, where he lay stunned and motionless. The boy threw himself on the fallen man with a cry of triumph, snatched up the knife that had dropped from his grasp, and with two quick strokes severed the cords that bound the old man. Then in a paroxysm of fury he turned to drive the weapon into the would-be assassin’s heart. Jack stayed his hand, and at the same moment heard the sound of trampling feet, and a familiar voice exclaiming: "This way, my men; we shall find the English bandit here." [Illustration: Jack makes an Opportune Appearance] "Miguel!" said Jack under his breath, remembering in a flash the one-eyed servant he had seen following him in Salamanca. Turning quickly to the old gentleman, who now stood in seeming uncertainty what the new interruption might portend, he pointed to the prostrate man and said: "It is this man’s master." Then, as there was obviously no time to parley, he rushed to the door and slammed it, intending to turn the key. The key was not in the lock. Pressing his knee against the door, Jack looked round and saw the missing key on the table. He called to the boy to bring it, but he was too late. The door was pressed inwards in spite of Jack’s exertions; there was greater force on the other side. Feeling it opening inch by inch Jack turned on his shoulder, set his back against the oak, and drew his sword, preparing to give way suddenly and attack the enemy before they could recover from their sudden inrush. But the boy, with a quick wit that did him credit, had rushed into the corner of the room, where there was a space of some two feet between the jamb and the wall, and there, crouching on the floor, he jabbed with the knife through the slowly widening aperture at the legs of the nearest figure. There was a yell of pain; the pressure on the door instantly relaxed; and Jack, putting forth all his strength, had almost succeeded in closing it when a musket was thrust into the gap. Jack’s muscles were strained to the utmost. From the clamour in the corridor he knew that the enemy were preparing for a concerted rush. He called to the old Spaniard to push the table against the door, but before that could be done he felt overpowering pressure on the other side. Hastily forming his resolution, he sprang back suddenly; the door flew open, and three of La Romana’s ragged ruffians fell sprawling upon the floor. Others came behind, and one of them, with his heavy flintlock, struck out of Jack’s hand the sword he had drawn, dropping his weapon immediately with a yell as he felt the boy’s knife in his leg. Jack saw that the old Spaniard had taken down one of two rapiers that hung on the wall beneath the portrait of an ancient caballero. Exerting all his strength, he dragged the table round so that it stood obliquely across the room, cutting off a triangular corner. Then he seized the second rapier, and stood side by side with the Spaniard, behind the table, facing their foes just as several of them were preparing to leap across it. Among them Jack now recognized Miguel Priego, his face lit up with savage excitement, flourishing his sword and goading on his desperadoes. The boy had crawled beneath the table, prepared to use his terrible knife on all who came within reach. The one-eyed man had recovered from the blow dealt him by Jack, and had snatched a musket from one of his fellows. Fortunately none of the firearms were loaded, and the Spaniards, mad with rage, grudged the delay necessary to charge their cumbrous weapons. "I think, Miguel, you had better call off your followers," said Jack, in a momentary lull that preceded the rush. There was no reply; in point of fact Jack scarcely expected one. Miguel was at the moment out of sight behind a burly mountaineer, and Jack felt rather by instinct than by any reasoned process of thought that the Spaniard would scarcely let slip this opportunity of taking him at a disadvantage. Behind the table Jack measured the forces opposed to him. Six men were gathering themselves for the onslaught—lean, half-starved wretches for the most part, but ugly customers in the bulk. A raw-boned mountaineer, armed with a long musket and a rusty bayonet, was the most formidable among the gang, and Jack marked him out for special attention when the critical moment came. It was not long in coming. At the cry from Miguel: "Down with the English dog!" the six made a simultaneous rush, and if they had not impeded one another’s movements they must have made short work of the little garrison. The lanky Asturian lunged viciously at Jack, who dodged the point by a hair’s-breadth, narrowly escaping, as he did so, the clubbed musket of another Spaniard on the right. Before the mountaineer could recover, Jack’s long rapier, stretching far across the table, had ploughed a gash in his arm from wrist to elbow, and at the same moment the second assailant, howling with pain, had dropped his musket and fallen to the ground a victim to the terrible knife of the little Spaniard, who had been forgotten by the enemy in the excitement of the fight. The old man, however, had been less successful; one of his opponents had felt the point of his rapier, but, attacked simultaneously by another, his weapon had been dashed from his grasp, and he now stood defenceless against the foe, who were beginning to push the table into the corner of the room. Miguel, having left the brunt of the action to his allies, now advanced resolutely to the attack; and Jack’s rapier had crossed with the long sword carried by his opponent, when through the open door sounded the heavy tramp of feet; and a loud voice was heard shouting: "What I want to know—" The sentence was never completed, for Corporal Wilkes sprang into the room, cleaving a way through the maddened Spaniards with his fist. Before they realized the meaning of this unlooked-for interruption, the corporal flung himself on Miguel, caught him by the collar, and hurled him upon two of his men, who fell under him with a resounding thud. Immediately behind Wilkes, Bates and two other men of the 95th had dashed in, and the rear of the unexpected reinforcement was brought up by Pepito, who at once engaged in a tussle with the Spanish boy, now upon his feet, for the possession of the knife. Wilkes stood with clenched fists over Miguel, while his companions of the 95th threw themselves on the other Spaniards and speedily disarmed them. "You hound of a Don!" cried Wilkes, preparing to knock Miguel down if he should attempt to rise; "what I want to—" "Wilkes, let him get up," said Jack quietly, coming round the table, the rapier still in his hand. Miguel rose stiffly, his face expressing the purest amazement. "Verdaderamente!" he exclaimed. "If it is not my dear friend Jack! There is some strange mistake. And I did not recognize you in your uniform, Jackino! Last time I saw you, you remember, you were dressed as one of ourselves. Truly, dress makes a world of difference, amigo mio." His tone had all the oily suavity that Jack knew so well, and so cordially detested. Wilkes was looking from one to the other with concentrated interrogation in his eye, ready at a word from Jack to lay the Spaniard low again. "Shut the door, Bates," said Jack, as he saw the one-eyed man slinking in that direction. "That’s your man, I think?" he added, addressing Miguel. "My servant, who accompanied me from Saragossa," replied Miguel. "And I am at a loss to understand—" "So am I," interrupted Jack. "I am at a loss to understand why a man in your position should countenance violence, robbery, almost actual murder." "Robbery! Murder! Really, my dear friend, these are strange words to me. I was in the street, and one of these men—soldiers in the army of the Marquis of La Romana—told me that an English ruffian—it was a mistake, yes, but he said an English ruffian—had forced himself into this house: for what purpose? It could only be, as you say, to rob or murder. You know what sad excesses your troops, usually so excellently disciplined, have been guilty of; and having but a short time ago heard that your colonel—Beckwith, is that his name?—had sternly ordered his men to refrain from acts of pillage, why, my dear friend, was it not natural for me to come in and do what little I could to prevent such admirable orders from being disobeyed? That explains—" "Oh!" said Jack. "And your man—was that his errand too?" "Perez? Oh no! He obtained my permission to visit his old master, the faithful fellow. It was inconvenient, for we should now be on the road; but could I—would you?—hesitate in such a case? I was touched by the poor fellow’s devotion." Perez’ solitary eye gleamed with a baleful light singularly out of keeping with the sentimental character thrust upon him by his master. He wriggled venomously in Bates’s grasp. The burly Rifleman checked his contortions by impressing his knuckles into the nape of his neck. Jack turned to the old man, who had watched the scene in dignified silence. "I think, Señor, you can throw some light on this man’s devotion." The Spaniard, in a few quiet words, told Jack that the man had, in fact, been his servant, but had been dismissed two years before for attempted robbery. He had suddenly made his appearance that evening, taken his old master unawares, and when he had bound him had broken open the bureau containing, as he supposed, the valuables he coveted, and, failing to find them, had demanded the secret of their hiding-place under threat of assassination. "I owe my life," he concluded, "the little that remains of it, to my son here, who providentially overheard from his bedroom above the threats of this wretch, and to you, Señor, whose chivalrous intervention came at a moment when I regarded my case as hopeless. I thank you!" "This, Señor," said Miguel, turning to the old man, "is to me a most extraordinary, a most painful, discovery. The man was recommended to me by Señor Alvarez, my father’s partner"—Miguel’s fluency in his present predicament recalled to Jack’s memory many of his youthful essays in mendacity. "It only shows, Señor, how sadly one may be deceived by a specious exterior." As he spoke he regarded his one-eyed follower with a look of mournful disappointment. If Perez’ exterior at this moment was any index to his quality, he was scarcely a man in whom the most credulous would have placed confidence. In Bates’s iron grip his body was quiescent; but the malignant glitter of his single eye told of raging fires within. "It will be my duty," continued Miguel with increasing sternness, "to bring this wretch to justice. Men, seize him, and see that he does not escape. He shall be dealt with by the marquis himself." The Spanish soldiers advanced to carry out Miguel’s order, but Bates merely tightened his grip and looked enquiringly at Jack for instructions. Jack could not but admire Miguel’s astuteness. He was perfectly well aware that the man would be released as soon as he was out of reach; but while loth to let him escape scot-free, he saw how powerless he was in the face of Miguel’s declaration. It was a matter for the Spanish authorities, in which, except as a witness, he himself had no concern; and it was nothing to the point that the Spanish authorities were hiding in cellars, lofts, and even, as he had heard, in pig-styes. He turned to the old man, and said: "I fear, Señor, that, as things are, we have no choice but to return this man to the care of his present—master. Bates," he added in English, "let him go." In apparent abstraction, Bates gave a farewell twist to the Spaniard’s neck-band, shot him among the knot of tattered soldiery in the doorway, drew himself up, and saluted. With a ceremonious bow Miguel followed his men from the room, several of them carrying with them painful mementoes of the affray. Wilkes shadowed them to the end of the corridor. Meanwhile the venerable Spaniard had taken a decanter and several glasses from a press in the corner of the room. "You will permit me, Señor," he said to Jack, "my servant having deserted me, to offer you and your worthy soldiers a little refreshment. It is a poor expression of my gratitude to you and them, but it comes, believe me, from a full heart." The men willingly tossed off their bumpers, and soon afterwards escorted Jack to his quarters. He there learnt from them that while at supper they had been summoned by Pepito, who announced in broken English, eked out by gestures, that el Señor Lumsden was in urgent need of help. He had apparently been shadowing Jack as usual, had seen him enter the house, and a moment after heard Miguel hounding on his willing dupes to kill the English bandit. "The little rascal is always putting me in his debt," said Jack to himself as the squad saluted and marched off. "He is quite a guardian angel." No one but Jack had cause to regard Pepito in this gracious light. "What I want to know," asked Corporal Wilkes wrathfully, when he returned to his billet "—what I want to know is, what’s become of my supper?" Only Pepito knew. *CHAPTER XIV* *An Incident at Cacabellos* Stragglers—Oblique Oration—The Massacre at Bembibre—Moore’s Appeal—A Shot in the Dark—A Souvenir There was no rest for Jack or his friends that night. On returning to his quarters he found that Colonel Beckwith had called the officers of the regiment together, and was already addressing them with more than usual seriousness. He told them that their hope of making a stand at Astorga was fated to be disappointed. Sir John Moore had decided to continue the retreat with all speed, either towards Vigo or towards Corunna. "It is useless to pretend I am pleased," said the colonel. "None of us are that. Some of the youngsters among us may think that things would be ordered differently if they were in command. That’s not our business. The general is satisfied that his reasons are good, and all we have to do is to obey orders. And that brings me to the point. A retreating army is always apt to get out of hand, and a British army perhaps more than any other. Take any man in the regiment and he’ll ask you why he should retreat, and what the dickens is the good of running away from a Frenchman. We’ve seen already what disorder and ruffianliness have disgraced some of the regiments. And I tell you, gentlemen, I won’t have that in the 95th. We shall from this time form a part of the actual rear-guard. The second battalion leaves, with other regiments, direct for Vigo to cover our left flank. The safety of the whole army will therefore depend much on us. The French won’t let us off lightly. We shall often be in touch with them, and if there’s any want of steadiness they’ll get through us, and then it’s all up. I ask you then, gentlemen, every one of you, to keep a tight hand on the men. There must be no slackness, no relaxation of discipline. The honour of the regiment is in your keeping, and, by heaven! I’ll never lift my head again if the 95th fails me." The colonel’s vehement words sent a thrill through the group, and Jack Lumsden was not the only officer among them who vowed inwardly not to disappoint "old Sidney". Beckwith went on to prescribe their immediate duties. He alluded to the confusion and disorder in which they had found the town, in great part due to the unexpected presence of La Romana’s ragged regiments. The place had been crammed with stores, consisting of shoes, blankets, tools, muskets, ammunition, from which many of the preceding regiments had been partially re-equipped. But in the haste and muddle the distribution had been mismanaged. Many of the stores had been left behind, and the town was full of British and Spanish stragglers eager to plunder where they could. The colonel instructed his officers to see that pillaging was checked as much as possible. What stores could not be removed were to be destroyed. During the night, therefore, Jack and his chums were busy in carrying out the colonel’s orders. It was found next day that there were not sufficient draught animals to serve for the transport of all the remaining stores, and the 95th were employed for many hours in burning and blowing up valuable stuff to prevent it from falling into the hands of the French. The regiments of the Reserve were to march in the evening for Cambarros, a village some nine miles in the direction of Villafranca. Before they started, Captain O’Hare paraded his company and repeated to them the substance of what Colonel Beckwith had said to the officers. "I’ve heard a deal of grumbling at times," he said. "You don’t want to retreat. No more do I, but our chance’ll come, please the pigs; and then I know who’ll be at the front—not the grumblers and skulkers, but the men who know how to obey. Now, my boys, I trust ye. I don’t want the general to send for me by and by and say: ’O’Hare, ye’ve the most blackguardly company in the whole army.’ We’ll do better than the best, and sure I’ll be proud of ye. And if there should be a man among ye with a deal o’ power over the company—a good soldier let us say, but with a long tongue and a way of speaking that—well, a way of speaking"—the captain studiously kept his eyes from Corporal Wilkes: "if there’s such a man, to him I’d say, with all my solemn seriousness: Ye’ve a deal of persuasion; then use it for the glory o’ the regiment; and bedad, I believe he’d know what I meant." Corporal Wilkes, looking straight in front of him, had turned a brick-red, and was unusually silent as the company marched off. To Sergeant Jones, the little Welshman, toddling along by his side, he remarked presently: "I hope you’ll mind what Peter said, Sergeant. As for me, ’tis a good thing for the glory o’ the regiment that the second battalion’s off another way, for all my good resolutions would be turned into sour milk by the long fiddle-face of Corp’ril MacWhirter." After their sleepless night, and hard work during the day, both officers and men were glad to fling themselves down on rough beds of hay and straw when they reached Cambarros at dusk. But they had hardly settled to rest when some dragoons came riding in with news that the enemy were advancing in force. The order was immediately given to get under arms, and the march was continued through the night. The Reserve reached Bembibre, a dirty village of mud and slate, at daybreak on January 1st, expecting now at least to enjoy the rest so much desired. But again they were disappointed. On entering the village they were at once ordered to pile arms and clear the place. It presented the appearance of a town that had recently been stormed and put to the sack. It happened to be a depôt for the wine produced in the neighbouring vineyards, and large quantities were stored in the vaults and cellars of the houses. The inhabitants had shown themselves unfriendly to the regiments of the main body of Moore’s army, and had provided food and drink for them only with the greatest reluctance. The result was that the men of the least-disciplined regiments broke all bounds, and set furiously to work to get for themselves what the Spaniards had denied them. Doors were wrenched off, windows smashed, property of all kinds destroyed; and the unfortunate discovery of so large a stock of wine had the worst consequences. Those were the days when hard drinking was the rule in all classes of society. It was little to be expected, then, that rough soldiers, suffering the hardships of exhausting marches on short rations, and feeling bitter shame and humiliation at having to retreat continually before a despised enemy, should prove able to withstand the temptation to excess. Ready to fight like bull-dogs if the call came, they lost all sense of responsibility at the sight of means to enjoyment, and set their officers at defiance. The Reserve spent that day and part of the next in chasing the stragglers from the houses and driving them along the streets towards the mountains; but the task had been only partly accomplished when cavalry pickets came in and reported that French dragoons were pushing rapidly down the Manzanal pass in their rear. "We must leave the ruffians to their fate," cried General Paget furiously, ordering the Reserve to march out towards Cacabellos. Not until late in the day did the 95th learn from the last of the hussar pickets what had happened when they left Bembibre. Lahoussaye’s dragoons had come galloping into the village, riding through the groups of stragglers who flocked staggeringly along the road when they heard the noise of the pursuing horse, and slashing at them as a schoolboy does at thistles. The French made no distinction of age or sex. They hewed their way indiscriminately through drunken redcoats, women, and children. Even mothers who held up their babies, pleading for mercy on them, were struck down as ruthlessly as soldiers with arms in their hands. Few escaped. Those who did bore terrible signs, in sabre-cuts on head and shoulders, of the revenge the French horse had wreaked for their defeat at Benavente. The road from Bembibre led over the crests of the Galician hills, with ravines and gorges and precipitous crags on both sides. Then it made a rapid and crooked descent, ending in a valley through which dashed a thundering river, white with foam, bearing huge stones and logs along with it in its tempestuous rush from the Asturian mountains to the ocean. Here the hill-slopes were covered with gaunt trees, which, though now bare of foliage, threw a mysterious gloom over the narrow road. Marching rapidly down this road against a beating storm of sleet, and whipping up innumerable stragglers on the way, the 95th at length arrived at Cacabellos. Here, just as they halted, Sir John Moore met them, having ridden back with his staff the five or six miles from Villafranca, where the main body had bivouacked. The regiments of the Reserve were at once formed up in columns in the fields by the roadside. Sir John, his fine face lined with care and sorrow, took up a position in their midst, and then, in his clear penetrating voice, amid a silence broken only by the distant thunder of the torrent, he spoke in stern biting phrases of the disorder and want of discipline he had lately witnessed. With a pungent irony that made many ears tingle, the commander-in-chief concluded his address thus: "And if the enemy are now in possession of Bembibre, as I believe they are, they have got a rare prize! They have taken or cut to pieces many hundreds of drunken British cowards—for none but unprincipled cowards would get drunk in presence, nay in the very sight, of the enemies of their country; and sooner than survive the disgrace of such infamous misconduct, I hope that the first cannon-ball fired by the enemy may take me in the head." After a few words, addressed specially to the 28th, which had done glorious service with him in Egypt, Sir John turned rein and rode back to Villafranca. His words made a deep impression on both officers and men. Previous appeals had not been in vain. The reserve regiments had kept much better discipline and committed fewer excesses than the main body, and the general’s stern speech deepened the resolve of all good soldiers to abstain from disorder, and merit Sir John’s approbation. Alas! all were not animated by the same spirit. General Paget bade the men encamp some distance away from the town, and gave orders that no one was to enter the streets unless accompanied by a non-commissioned officer, who was to be held responsible for the orderly return of those committed to his charge. But no sooner had darkness fallen over the camp than many of the soldiers, forgetting the reproof of Sir John Moore, forgetting the subsequent appeals of the company officers, escaped from their lines, and, entering the town, resumed the old work of plundering. During the night many were arrested by the patrols, and two men were seized in the act of committing a serious crime, of which few had yet been guilty. They were maltreating and robbing a poor old Spaniard, who, paralysed with fright, was piteously beseeching them to take all that he had, but to do him no harm. "This means a drumhead court-martial!" said Captain O’Hare when the matter was reported. "Keep the men in irons; Lumsden, take a note to the general from me." Jack had delivered his note, and was returning to his quarters, when, as he passed along a broad road shadowed by trees on one side and a high wall on the other, he felt that someone was dogging him. He had heard no pursuing footsteps; he was at a loss to account for his strange uneasiness; but, obeying an impulse of which he was only half-conscious, he turned suddenly round, moving as he did so a little towards the wall on his right. At the same moment there was a report and a flash. A bullet whizzed past him; he could feel the rush of air on his cheek, there was a dull thud as the missile flattened itself on the stone wall. Springing forward in the direction of the report, he could just discern in the murk a tall figure scuttling for cover among the trees. The man had a dozen yards’ start, but Jack, always a good sprinter, had reduced the gap by half when his quarry disappeared into the trees. It was a narrow belt of chestnuts about three or four deep, and, following the sound of the footsteps in front, Jack dashed through, heedless of obstacles. A moment’s scramble among roots and brambles brought him to the far side; his assailant had turned sharp to the right and was scampering towards a high wall running parallel with the belt on the opposite side of the road. With a fine spurt Jack reduced the gap to an arm’s-length; his outstretched hand was within a few inches of the man’s collar, when, to his utter amazement, the pursued disappeared into the wall. Jack shot past an open door, and before he could check his progress there was a violent bang and the sound of falling bolts. Jack pushed against the door, then threw himself upon it with all his force; it did not even creak. The wall was too high to clamber over; it was too long to go round; he had perforce to relinquish the thought of further pursuit. "Some poor demented Spaniard who has lost his all, perhaps," he thought, and was about to resume his walk when he noticed a small triangle of cloth projecting between the door and the jamb. The would-be assassin’s cloak had caught, and, but that the door was rather clumsily fitted, would have prevented its being closed. Without any definite motive, Jack drew his sword and cut off the strip, which he put into his pocket, where it lay for many days forgotten. He said nothing about the adventure to his fellow-officers, and it did not keep him awake for an instant when, at a late hour that night, he threw himself, worn out, upon his uncomfortable bed. *CHAPTER XV* *The Great Retreat* Reprieve—A Fight in prospect—Trapped—Napoleon leaves Spain—Salvage—The Tragedy of War—In Motley—A Breathing Space—The Slough of Despond—Motherless—Thalatta!—A Batman’s Battle The growing spirit of indiscipline and lawlessness among the Reserve determined General Paget to make a signal example of the culprits. Early on the following morning he marched all the five regiments under his command towards the crown of a low hill overhanging Cacabellos, in the direction of Bembibre. After sending pickets to the summit, to keep the enemy under observation, he ordered the whole division to form a hollow square, the men facing inwards. Some distance to the rear of each regiment, the officers sat in drumhead court-martial. The men caught in the act of plundering were brought before them, tried, and sentenced, and then taken into the square, where, lashed to the triangles, they received the punishment awarded. During this scene the general sat stern and impassive on his horse. At one moment a cavalry vedette galloped up with news that the French were in sight. "Very well," replied the general, and the punishment went on. Soon another trooper appeared, to report that the enemy were rapidly advancing. "Very well," said the general, without movement or further word. So many were the offenders that the work of flogging continued for several hours. At length came the turn of the two soldiers taken in the act of assaulting and robbing the Spaniard. They were summarily tried, and condemned to be hanged. At one corner of the square stood a tree with accessible branches. The unhappy men were conveyed thither, with halters round their necks. They were hoisted on the shoulders of two strong Riflemen, and the ropes were fastened to the lower boughs. It was just twelve o’clock. One movement of the supporting men would leave the criminals dangling in the air. The whole division awaited in breathless stillness the dread signal for execution. General Paget looked grimly down from his horse upon the wretched men, and in his set face they saw no hope of mercy. At this tense moment a captain of dragoons galloped through a gap opened for him in one side of the square. Halting before the general, he excitedly reported that the pickets on the hill were being driven in. "I am sorry for it, sir," said the general coldly; "and I should rather have expected the information from a trooper than from you. Go back to your fighting pickets, sir," he added sternly, "and animate your men to a full discharge of their duties." The officer retired. General Paget was again silent. His lips twitched, his eyes flamed. Then suddenly he burst out: "My God! is it not lamentable to think, that when I might be preparing my troops to receive the enemies of their country, I am preparing to hang two robbers! But if at this moment the French horse should penetrate that angle of the square, I will still execute these villains at this angle." Again he was silent, and now shots were heard from the direction of the hill. The awed soldiers looked with consternation at their general’s face. How long was this suspense to continue? A brief pause; then, swinging round in the saddle, Paget cried: "If I spare the lives of these two men, will you promise to reform?" A quiver passed along the ranks; the men held their breath; there came not a murmur from their parted lips. "If I spare the lives of these men," again said the general, "will you give me your word of honour as soldiers that you will reform?" Still the same awful silence reigned—and the ominous sound of firing came nearer and nearer. "Say ’yes’ for God’s sake!" whispered an officer to the man next him. "Yes," murmured the man. His neighbours repeated the word in firmer tones, and then, as though a match had been laid to a train of powder, shouts of "Yes! yes!" rang along the faces of the square. "Cut the ropes!" cried the general. The prisoners were instantly released, the triangles removed. The men cheered, and as the square was reduced, and formed into columns, the British pickets came slowly over the brow of the hill, steadily retreating before the advance-guard of the enemy. Paget’s orders were rapidly given. The men started at the double towards the River Cua behind them. Three battalions crossed the bridge and took up their position behind a line of vineyards and stone walls parallel to the stream. A battery of horse-artillery, escorted by the 28th, was placed so as to command the road in its ascent towards Cacabellos from the bridge, and a squadron of the 15th Hussars, together with half the 95th Rifles, was left on the Bembibre side of the river to keep observation on the French. "At last, my boys!" said Captain O’Hare. The men of his company were flushed with excitement. At last! The weary waiting of two months was at an end; the enemy were upon them; and now every man tingled with the joy of the fight to come, and greedily watched for the foe. The officers, looking along their ranks, could not but be struck with the wonderful change. Gone the blank despair, gone the sullen discontent, gone the hang-dog look; every man’s face was lit up, every man’s eyes flashed, every man stood erect with an air of high-hearted staunchness that had not been seen for many a day. "There they are!" cried Pomeroy, whose keen eyes had descried Colbert’s hussars advancing cautiously over the hill-top. At this moment the bugle sounded for the last companies of the 95th to retire across the bridge and occupy the defensive positions allotted to them. The men marched with alacrity; it was certain there must be a fight now. Jack’s was the rearmost company but one. It had only reached the middle of the bridge when the 15th Hussars came riding behind in hot haste, and the infantry were in imminent danger of being trampled down. The French were pressing on in such force that the hussars, wholly outnumbered, had been hurriedly withdrawn. Unsupported, the 95th were too weak to withstand a charge of cavalry; they must retire, and there was no time to lose. "Hurry your stumps!" shouted a trooper as he passed Wilkes. "No hurry!" said the corporal coolly, looking over his shoulder. But behind them Colbert’s hussars and chasseurs had swept down on to the bridge and ridden into the rear-most company. Some of the latter were cut down, half were captured, the rest succeeded in gaining the farther bank, and joined their comrades behind the vineyard walls. "A close shave, mates!" said Wilkes. "But let ’em come on; we’re ready." General Colbert, a young and gallant officer, and reputed the handsomest man in the French army, had reached the bridge, and saw that the slopes on the other side were held by artillery and what appeared to be a small infantry escort. All the regiments but the 28th were by this time concealed from view. Burning to distinguish himself, and anxious to emulate the successful charge of Franceschi’s dragoons at Mansilla a few days before, Colbert did not wait to reconnoitre the position and discover the actual strength of his enemy, but ranged his leading regiment four abreast, and led them straight for the bridge. Paget’s guns played briskly on the French horse until, with the dip in the road, they sank below the line of fire; then the hidden infantry followed up with steady volleys from the walls and hedges. But the French were barely within range. The majority of the troopers escaped injury, cleared the bridge, and dashed up the hill, to carry, as they thought, all before them. Then the men of Paget’s Reserve showed their mettle. The 28th were drawn across the road; the 52nd and the 95th were out of sight behind the vineyard walls; and the French horsemen fell into the fatal trap. They suddenly found themselves in the midst of a hail of bullets from left, and right, and front. For a brief moment they struggled on; then Tom Plunket, leaping the wall and flinging himself flat on the slope, fired two marvellous shots which killed Colbert and his aide-de-camp in succession, whereupon the whole brigade wheeled about and fled madly back to the bridge, leaving the road strewed with their killed and wounded. Cheer after cheer broke from the ranks of the exultant British infantry. Many of the men wished to leap the walls and pursue the baffled enemy, and had to be pulled back like hounds straining at the leash. Not a man had been lost since they left the bridge, and Paget’s "Well done, Riflemen!" was like wine to their hearts. But the fray was not yet over. Lahoussaye’s dragoons swept down to the river, avoided the fatal bridge, forded the stream at several points, and tried to make their way over the rocky ground and through the vineyards. Finding this impossible, they dismounted and advanced on foot in skirmishing order, meeting with a spirited response from the 52nd and 95th, whom they first encountered. Then, as the afternoon wore on, Merle’s light regiments of the line came into sight, and in column formation marched forward with loud cries to cross the bridge. For a few moments the 52nd were in danger of being swept upon and overwhelmed, but the six guns from the battery above opened a raking fire on the massed columns of French, and drove them back pell-mell to the other side. For an hour longer the French sharpshooters kept up a skirmish with the 95th and 52nd; then, as darkness fell, they recognized the hopelessness of their attack, gave up the contest, and hastened down the slopes to the eastern bank of the Cua. "By George, this is a change of scene!" said Smith, standing with his fellow-subalterns around a hastily lit fire. "Won’t the Grampus be green when he hears what he has missed? I wonder what the fellow is doing?" "Offering Napoleon long odds on something or other," said Jack with a laugh. He had hardly spoken when the command came to form up in marching order. Sir John Moore had ridden back from Villafranca on hearing Paget’s cannon, and was delighted to hear of his old friend’s success. The French having suffered so decisive a check, he saw that the Reserve could be safely withdrawn under cover of night. The troops set out in better spirits than they had known for many a day, tramping cheerily over the snow-covered road with the comfortable assurance that at last they had won the general’s approbation and proved themselves men. Their gaiety was doubled when they learnt from a wounded prisoner on the way that Napoleon was no longer behind them. He had withdrawn part of his army, leaving Soult and Ney to continue the pursuit. The thought that they had baffled the great emperor was delightful to the British troops: they never doubted that Napoleon had seen he was beaten by Johnny Moore, and had run away in sheer petulance and chagrin. Four miles after leaving the scene of their brilliant rear-guard action, the Reserve arrived at the outskirts of Villafranca. Long before, they had noticed a red glow in the sky, which as they approached threw a rosy light upon the banks of dazzling driven snow. As they drew still nearer, the whole town seemed to be on fire. In every street great heaps of stores and provisions were burning, and so thoroughly was the work of destruction being carried out that guards had been placed even round the doomed boxes of biscuit and salt meat. But the temptation was irresistible to hungry soldiers; many men, as they passed, stuck their bayonets or pikes into junks of salt pork that were actually on fire, and bore them off in great glee. The men had been marching so steadily that the officers for the most part winked at this rescue from the flames, Jack remarking to Pomeroy that they’d all be precious glad to get a slice or two of the meat by the time the march was ended. After leaving Villafranca they passed through the defile of Piedrafita into still wilder country. Climbing Monte Cebrero and emerging on to the barren plain of Lugo, the troops reached Herrerias shortly before daybreak. They were suffering intensely from fatigue and cold, but their halt for food and rest was of the shortest; as soon as day dawned they had to set off again. Now that daylight illumined the scene, they saw terrible signs of the misery and disorder into which the constant forced marching had thrown the main body. The road was strewn with wreckage of all kinds—horses were lying dead, wagons lay shattered and abandoned; here was a rusty musket, there a broken sword; worn-out boots, horse-shoes, pots, articles of apparel, dotted the white and rugged causeway for miles. Worse than that, human bodies were mingled with these evidences of woe. At one spot Jack saw a group of redcoats stretched on the snow. Thinking they were stragglers asleep, he went to rouse them. They made no response to voice or touch; in their sleep they had been frozen to death. As the day wore on, other incidents added to the general misery. The horses of Lord Paget’s cavalry were constantly foundering through losing their shoes on the stony road. When this happened, the dragoons dismounted, and led their chargers till the poor beasts could go no farther. Then, by Lord Paget’s orders, they were shot, so that they might not fall into the hands of the French. Many a rough trooper shed tears as he raised his pistol to the head of the faithful animal whose friend he was, and as the cracking of the pistols reverberated from the rocks, the sounds sent a painful shudder through the ranks of the trudging infantry. Hundreds of stragglers from the leading divisions loitered along the road, causing an exasperating delay to the march of the disciplined Reserve. Among the laggards were not merely the marauders and ne’er-do-wells who had cast off all obedience, but veterans who were overcome by the rigours of the winter cold and the heavy marching on diminished rations. Every mile brought new horrors. Many sick and wounded were being conveyed in baggage-wagons, which, as the beasts failed, were abandoned, leaving their human occupants to perish in the snow. Women and children panted along beside their husbands and fathers, or rode in the few wagons that were left; but many dropped on the road and died of cold and fatigue. Looking back from a spur of the mountain chain, Jack saw the white road behind covered with dead and dying, a black spot here, a red spot there, showing where a woman or a soldier lay sleeping the last sleep. The groans of women, the wails of little children, were torture to the ears of the more sympathetic. Sometimes a soldier whose wife had given up the struggle, would fling himself down beside her, and, cursing the general whose object he so grievously misunderstood, remain to die. Long after dark the Reserve reached Nogales, where they remained for the rest of the night. Before dawn, however, news came that the enemy were pursuing close upon them, and as they marched out, the rear companies became hotly engaged with French cavalry. The force hurried on, across a many-spanned bridge, up a zigzag road, skirmishing all the way, and halting at favourable points to tempt the enemy to attack. At one spot the mountain rose up a sheer wall on the right of the road, and on the left a deep precipice fell steeply to a valley. Here General Paget ordered the men to face round. The position could not be gained by a frontal assault, and the enemy, waiting for their heavy columns to come up, sent voltigeurs and some squadrons of cavalry into the valley to attempt a flank attack. But deep drifts of snow having hidden the inequalities in the ground, men and horses tumbled head over heels as they advanced, and, amid grim cheers from the British troops above, the French withdrew discomfited. Fighting almost every yard of ground, the Reserve continued their rigorous march towards Lugo. Near Constantino they were amazed to meet a train of fifty bullock-carts crammed with stores and clothing for La Romana’s army. Someone had blundered. The Spaniards were dispersed far and wide, and, but for its being intercepted by the British, the convoy must inevitably have fallen into the hands of the French. Astounded at this piece of Spanish folly, but rejoiced at the luck which had in cities, and on the great roads in Asia. Those in Upper _Hindustan_, built by the emperors of _Dilli_, are grand and costly; they are either of stone or burnt bricks. In Persia, they are mostly of bricks dried in the sun. In Upper _Hindustan_ they are commonly sixteen to twenty miles distant from each other, which is a _manzil_ or stage. They are generally built of a square or quadrangular form with a large open court in the centre, and contain numerous rooms for goods, men, and beasts. [275] Literally, made excuses from the surface of his heart," i.e., not serious excuses. [276] That is, "completely armed." Vide note 2, page 87. [277] On the exact meaning of _dastar-khwan,_ see note, page 104. [278] The _Musalman_ confession of faith, see note 3, page 156. [279] The idiom "_do mahine ek_," about two months, similar to the phrase, "_pachas ek baras_," _v._ note 1, page 161. [280] Literally, "began to smack his lips;" denoting his satisfaction. [281] Tartar, African, and Turkish slaves. [282] Literally, "I have not proved false in what you have entrusted to me." [283] The coffee and pipe are always presented to visitors in Turkey, Arabia, and Persia, and they are considered as indispensable in good manners. [284] "_dant kholne_" is fully explained in my Grammar, page 129. It appears to have sadly puzzled a learned critic, to whom I have occasionally alluded. [285] Literally, "middle brother;" as there were three in number, of course the "second" and "middle" are identical. [286] The _Siyum_ are the rites performed for the dead on the third day after demise; it is called the _tija_ in _Hinduwi_. [287] Alluding to God. [288] Or it may mean, "my blood boiled" [with resentment]. [289] The _Muhammadan_ sabbath is Friday. [290] A _kafila_ means a company of merchants who assemble and travel together for mutual protection. It is synonymous with caravan. [291] _Bukhara_ is a celebrated city in Tartary; it was formerly the capital of the province called _Mawaralnahr_, or _Transoxiana_, before the Tartar conquerors fixed on _Samarkand_. It lies to the northward of the river _Oxus_ or _Gihun_, which divides Tartary from Persia, or as the Persian geographers term it, _Iran_, from _Turan_. _Bukhara_ is celebrated by Persian poets for its climate, its fruits, and its beautiful women. [292] The _boza_ is an intoxicating drink made of spirits, the leaves of the _charas_ plant, _tari_, and opium. _Tari_, erroneously called _todee_, is the juice of the palm tree. [293] Literally, ale-house, or tippling-house. One is strongly led to believe that this is the origin of our cant word _boozing-ken_, imported from the East by the gipsies some four or five centuries ago. [294] A grateful and luxurious operation in the warm climate of India, more especially after the fatigue of travelling. _Shampooing_ is a word of uncertain etymology; the French have a better term, _masser_. The natives say it has a physical advantage, as it quickens their languid circulation; perhaps they are right. [295] A _kos_ is nearly two English miles, being about fifteen furlongs. [296] Literally, "the fire was kindled in my stomach." [297] Pointing to his two brothers who were present, and heard his tale. [298] The stake was a common mode of punishment in India in former days, and, until recently, was practised among the _Sikhs_, _Marhattas_, and other Asiatic princes, who were independent of our government. [299] Addressing himself to the king _Azad Bakht_. [300] The term _kibla_ signifies the "point of adoration," and is generally applied to the _Ka'ba_, or holy edifice, situated in the sacred inclosure of Mecca. To this point all _Muhammadans_ must turn when they pray. [301] The prayer of martyrdom among the _Musalmans._ It is often repeated when they go into action against Christians and Pagans [302] According to the _Muhammadan_ belief, _Nakir_ and _Munkir_ are two angels who attend at the moment of death, and call to an account the spirit of the deceased. [303] Literally, "satiated the dog of my stomach." [304] Literally, to perform the act of "rubbing the nose on the earth," expressive of extreme humility. [305] Literally, "having fastened [on his person] the four mirrors." [306] The term _zuhr_ strictly denotes the period devoted to the mid-day prayer, which is offered up after the sun has perceptibly declined from the meridian. Vide note 4, in page 14. [307] The name of the countries which lie, as the people of _Hindustan_ term it, below Bengal, i.e., to the south-east of it; the name includes the kingdoms of Ava and Pegu. [308] _Kunwar_ is the _Hindu_ name for the son of a _raja_. [309] The _chaugan_ is a Persian sport performed on horseback, with a large ball like a foot-ball, which is knocked about with a long stick like a shepherd's crook; it is precisely the game called in Scotland "shintey," and in England "hockey," only that the players are mounted. [310] _Rani_ is the _Hindu_ name of a _raja's_ wife. [311] Literally, "without a partner." The _Musalmans_ consider our doctrine of the Trinity as a deadly error. [312] _Sarandip_ is the name for the island of Ceylon among the Arabs and Persians, as well as the _Musalmans_ of India. The ancient _Hindu_ name was _Lanka_, applied both to the island and its capital. [313] The term _kisra_ is evidently applied here to _Naushirwan_, not to Cyrus, as is stated in some books. [314] _Iran_ is the ancient name of Persia in its more extended sense, that is, the Persian Empire. _Fars_ is sometimes used in the same sense. Strictly speaking, it denotes Persia proper, which is only a province of _Iran_. [315] The _kafila-bashi_ is the head man of the _kafila_, or company of merchants, who travel in a body for mutual safety, and compose what is commonly called a caravan, properly a _karwan_; the richest and most respectable merchant of the party is generally elected _bashi_; all the rest obey his orders, and he directs the movements, &c., of the whole company, and moreover, acts, in all cases of dispute, as judge and magistrate. [316] The _farsakh_, or _farsang_, or _parsang_, is a measure of distance in Persia, and contains at the present day about 3 3/4 English miles. Herodotus reckoned the _[Greek: pasasaggaes]_; in his time at 30 Grecian stadia. [317] _Salsabil_ is the name of a fountain of Paradise, according to _Muhammadan_ belief. [318] The student is of course aware that in most languages a question is frequently equivalent to a negative, as in this sentence. A sapient critic, to whom I have more than once alluded, was pleased to honour me with the following profound remark on the reading given in the original, viz.--"There is a slip here in Forbes's edition, as well as the Calcutta one. The word _nahin_, 'not,' is omitted, which destroys the whole sense!!!" [319] The _kaliyan_ (or as the moderns say, _kaliyun_) is the Persian _hukka_. [320] This is, as the vulgate hath it, "coming it a little too strong;" but be it remembered that Oriental story-tellers do not mar the interest of their narrative by a slavish adherence to probability. [321] Here the king _Azad Bakht_ speaks in his own person, and addresses himself to the four _darweshes_. [322] With regard to the essence of _bed-mushk_ vide note 2, page 42. [323] The image of the Divine power in that country of Pagans. [324] Vide note 3, page 30, respecting the _chilla_, or "period of forty." [325] That is to say, she had never seen a _Muhammadan_ at his prayers. [326] _Lat_ and _Manat_ were the two great idols of _Hindu_ worship in former times. [327] In the languages of southern India, _Turk_ is the general appellation for a _Musalman_. [328] The _chaman_ is a small garden or _parterre_, which is laid out before the sitting room in the interior of the women's apartments; it means in general, _parterres_ of flowers. [329] The original uses a much stronger expression. [330] Literally, the poison of the _halahal_, as expression used to denote poison of the strongest kind. The _halahal_ is a fabulous poison, said to have been produced from the ocean on the churning of it by the gods and _daityas._ Our critic says, on this word, that it means "deadly!!!" will he favour us with some authority on that point, better than his own? [331] On the phrase, _do mahine men_, our critic comes out in great force. He says, "Mir Amman here sins against grammar; it should be, _do mahinon men!!!_" The critic is not aware, that when a noun follows a numeral it never requires the inflection plural en, except when it is to be rendered more definite? In reality, Mir Amman would be wrong if he had employed the reading recommended by the sapient critic; _do mahine men_ means "in two months;" _do mahinon men_ "in _the_ two months" (previously determined upon). [332] The _chor-mahall_ is a private seraglio. [333] The twelve _Imams_.--Vide note 3, page 4. [334] The threshold of a pagoda or mosque. The oriental people uncover their feet, as we do our heads, on entering a place of worship. [335] Asiatics do not sign their names, but put their seals to letters, bonds, paper, &c.; on the seal is engraven their names, titles, &c.; which absurd practice has frequently given rise to much roguery, and even bloodshed, as it is so easy, by bribes, to get a seal-cutter to forge almost any seal, a notorious instance of which appeared some twenty years ago in the case of the _Raja_ of _Sattara_. Though the _Muhammadan_ laws punish with severe penalties such transgressions, yet seal-cutters are not more invulnerable to the powers of gold than other men. Kings, princes, _nawwabs_ &c., have a private mark, as well as a public seal, to official papers; and a private seal and mark for private or confidential papers. [336] A _khil'at_ or honorary dress is generally bestowed on a person when he is appointed to a new situation. [337] Literally, "who could hit a _kauri_ suspended by a hair." The _kauri_ is a small round shell used to denote the minutest denomination of money. In Bengal it is about the hundredth part of a _paisa_. [338] The _nazar_ or _pesh-kash_ is a sum of money, &c., which, all oriental officials pay to the prince of the country, or to his favourites, &c., when appointed to their situations. Some people say that such things are done nearer home, with this difference, that among us it is a private transaction; whereas, in the East, it is an open one. [339] _ja-girs_ are donations of lands, or, rather, of the revenues arising from a certain portion of land; strictly speaking, such a grant is a reward for military service, though it is sometimes bestowed without that condition. [340] As the _Musalmans_ reckon their day from sun-set, this is no _bull_. [341] Literally, "the third fault is that of the mother." [342] The king here resumes his address to the four darweshes. [343] A proverb synonymous to ours, of "What is bred in the bone, will never come out of the flesh." [344] The _tawa_ is a circular plate of malleable or cast iron, used for baking cakes or bannocks. It is slightly convex, like a watch-glass, on the upper side, where the bread is laid on; the under or concave side being, of course perfectly black. In Scotland, and in the northern counties of England, this domestic implement is called "the girdle," and is still in common use in places remote from towns. [345] Till recently a province of Persia; the northern part of ancient Media. It is now, alas! fallen into the deadly grasp of the unholy Muscovite. [346] A kind of pea common in India; it is the ordinary food of horses, oxen, camels, &c., likewise of the native. By Europeans it is generally called _grum_ or "_graum_." [347] The _Muhammadans_ believe that on the day of judgment all who have died will assemble on a vast plain, to hear their sentences from the mouth of God; so the reader may naturally conceive the size of the plain. [348] The _surma_ is a black powder made of antimony, which the Asiatic women use on their eyelids, to give a superior lustre to their black or hazel eyes; when applied with taste, it certainly has that effect. It is likewise used for sore eyes, but I cannot say with what success. [349] _Chummak_ is the Turkish name for a kind of _baton_ set with precious stones, and used by some of the officers of the palace as an insignia of state, like our rods, wands, &c. [350] This ludicrous idea is to be found in the veracious "Voiage and Travaile" of Sir John Maundevile, Kt. Speaking of the "Yles abouten Ynde," he says, "men fynden there an Ile that is clept Crues," where "for the grete distresse of the hete, mennes ballokkes hangen down to their knees, for the grete dissolucioun of the body." [351] The _Hur_ are celestial females, and the _Ghilman_ beautiful youths, who are to attend upon all good Mahometans in Paradise. [352] The _nakkar-khana_ is the place at the portico of a temple or palace where drums are beaten at stated intervals. It is somewhat akin to the "belfry," of a Romish church, the childish and everlasting noise of which is supposed to constitute an important part of Christianity. [353] _Padmini_, the highest and most excellent of the four classes of women among the _Hindus_. [354] The prime minister, or first officers of state, under the _Mughal_ emperors. [355] Literally, "instant of an instant." With regard to this idiomatic use of the genitive case, vide "Grammar," page 96, paragraph _b_. [356] Here the _khwaja_ resumes his own story to _Azad Bakht_. [357] The king, _Azad Bakht_, speaks in his own person. [358] The son of a _khwaja_ or merchant of the highest grade. [359] When _Musalmans_ go on pilgrimage to _Mecca_, they shave their heads on their arrival there; the ridicule is, to have incurred the shaving without the merit of the pilgrimage. [360] Called the _khil'at sarafrazi_, i.e. of exaltation. [361] The _farsh_ is the carpet or cloth which is spread in the room, where company is received, or the king's audience is held; for the king to advance to the end of the _farsh_ to receive the _wazir_, is a mark of respect, which Asiatic princes seldom pay, even to their equals. [362] The insignia of the _wazir's_ office in India and Persia, is the _kalumdan._ [363] The abode of a _fakir_ is called a _takiya_. [364] The phrase _kot bundh baithna_ signifies to squat down as a person does when easing nature, the two hands being clasped together round the legs a little below the knees. [365] _Chaupar_ is a very ancient Indian game of the nature of backgammon, played by four people, each having four men or pieces. A full description of it is given in the Ayeeni Akbary, London, 1800, vol. 1st, page 253. [366] _Azur_, the father of Abraham, was a famous statuary and idol-worshipper, according to the ideas of _Muhammadans_. [367] Alluding to the _Hindu_ custom of the wife's burning herself with the corpse of her husband; in these cases, perhaps, fear of the priesthood, &c., is a stronger motive than love for the defunct. [368] By the Island of the Franks, it is most probable that the author means Britain. The description of the capital is more adapted to London sixty years ago than to any other European city. This, _Mir Amman_ might have learned from some of the resident Europeans, while he filled up the rest from his own luxuriant imagination. [369] The "eunuch" is of course out of place in a Christian city; at least he does not hold the same rank as in the East. [370] In the original it is water; the meaning is obvious enough. [371] Most probably the name of some famous armourer. [372] A Persian proverb. [373] That is poison of the strongest kind.--Vide note on this word in page 213. [374] Meaning in this world and the next. [375] Barbers in Asia not only shave but wash persons in the private and public baths. [376] A prince of _Khurasan_, who quitted a throne in order to lead a life of piety. [377] A celebrated city of _Khurasan_, famous in former times for its riches. [378] The attitude of respect, common in the East, when a servant has a request to make of his master; or a very inferior person of one who is greatly his superior. [379] Meaning, "of surpassing speed." [380] In the original, the word is _kai_, or the green scum that floats on stagnant water. "_Bihzad Khan_, dispersed the enemy as _kai_ is dispersed when a stone is thrown into the water," is nearly the original simile. [381] Literally, "merely continued bringing up the soil from the bottom." [382] The first and second _Darweshes_. [383] One of the many epithets applied to _Darweshes_ in the East. [384] A Persian proverb. [385] The regent; the fourth _Darwesh's_ uncle. [386] According to the fabulous system of _jinns, divs, paris, &c.,_ in Asia, it is supposed that the _jinns_ and _paris_ live on essences, &c. The _divs_ are malignant spirits or beings, and live on less delicate food. [387] _Divs_ or demons; the malignant race of _jinns_. [388] _Chin_ and _Machin,_ is the general name of China among the Persians. [389] _Bukhur_ is a kind of frankincense. [390] _Abu-Jahal_, or "the father of obstinacy," or "of brutality," was the name of an Arab. He was uncle to the prophet _Muhammad_, and an inveterate opposer of the latter's new religion. [391] The forty figures of monkeys would give the possessor a power over the _divs_ and _jinns_, and having them at his command, he could easily overset the usurper, _alias_ his uncle. [392] The _Ismi A'zam_, or great name of God.--See note 2, p. 145. [393] Alluding to the Asiatic custom of the women being concealed from the view of all, except their husbands or very near relations. [394] The _kazis_ and _muftis_ are the judges in Turkey, Arabia, Persia and _Hindustan_, of all civil and religious causes; they likewise marry, divorce, &c. [395] The _tija_ is the same as the _siyum_.--See note 2, page 187. [396] A kind of litter for the conveyance of women and the sick. [397] A kind of litter for travelling in Persia and Arabia; two of them are slung across a camel or a mule; those for camels carry four persons. [398] Viz., his state of castration. [399] _Zu-l-fakar_, the name of a famous sword that _'Ali_ used to wear. [400] The veiled horseman, _'Ali Mushkil-Kusha_. [401] In the original there is a play on the words _haml_ and _hamal_. [402] Literally, "he made the man in want of a _kauri_ the master of a _lakh_ [of rupees]. [403] _Ryots_ (a corruption of the word _ra'iyat_) are the husbandmen in India; the tillers of the soil who rent small parcels of land from the government, through the medium of the _zamin-dar_, who is a servant of government and not the proprietor of the land, as some have erroneously supposed. The word means keeper of the land, and not the proprietor. In fact, he is like the Irish middleman, in every sense of the word. [404] A famous garden in Arabia Felix; it is also applied to the garden in Paradise, in which all good Mahometans, according to their belief, are to revel after death. [405] _'Umman_ is the name of the southern part of _Yaman_ or Arabia Felix; the country which lies between the mouth of the Persian Gulf and the mouth of the Red Sea; the sea which washes this coast is called the sea of _'Umman_ in Persia and Arabia, as the Red Sea is called the sea of _Kulzum_. [406] A mode of punishment used in former times in Persia, India, and Arabia, against great enemies or atrocious delinquents. Such treatment the poor emperor Valerian experienced from the haughty _Shapur_ or _Shabar_ (the Sapores of the Greeks), king of Persia or Parthia. [407] The first _darwesh_. [408] The second _darwesh_. [409] The third _darwesh_. [410] The fourth _darwesh_. [411] The five pure bodies are _Muhammad_, the prophet; _Fatima_, his daughter; _Ali_, her husband; and _Hazan_ and _Husain_, their chidren. [412] The fourteen innocents are the children of _Hazan_ and _Husain_. [413] By an arithmetical operation called in Persian _Abjad_; as Persian letters have arithmetical powers, the letters which compose the words _Bagh O Bahar_ added up, produce the sum 1217. From the inscription on most _Muhammadan_ tombs, and those on the gates of mosques, the dates of demise and erection can be ascertained. We had the same barbarous custom in Europe about the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; see the Spectator (No. 60,) on this ridiculous subject, which was considered as a proof of great ingenuity. [414] A pun on the word _Bahar_, which means spring, when flowers are in full bloom; but the French word _printemps_ conveys more exactly the compound signification; for _Bahar_ not only means spring, but an agreeable spring. The Persians are as fond of these _double entendres_ as any other people; their poetry is strewed with them, and so is their prose. It is not, however, to be considered as a model of pure taste. = = = PG11758 = = = BALDY OF NOME E-text prepared by Charles Aldarondo, Graeme Mackreth, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this file which includes the original illustrations.

His most diverting efforts had failed to gain the usual reward of a caress, or at least a word of understanding; and so, dog-like to express his sympathy, he came close beside his friend and licked his hand. Always, before, this had called attention to the fact that Baldy was ready to share any trouble with the boy--but to-day the rough and grimy little hand, stiff and blue from the cold, did not respond, and instead only brushed away the tears that rolled slowly down the pinched cheeks. Sometimes the slight body shook with sobs that the boy tried manfully to suppress; but when one is chilled, and tired and hungry, and in the shadow of a Great Tragedy, the emotions are not easy to control. With unseeing eyes and dragging steps, the boy trudged along the snowy trail, dreading the arrival at Golconda Camp. For there was the House of Judgment, where all of the unfortunate events of that most unhappy day would be reviewed sternly, though with a certain harsh justice, that could result in nothing less than a sentence of final separation from Baldy. And so when the dog in his most subtle and delicate manner showed his deep love for the boy, it only made the thought of the inevitable parting harder to bear. So completely was Ben lost in his own gloomy reflections that he did not hear the sound of bells behind him; and it was not until a cheery voice called out demanding the right of way that he stepped aside to let a rapidly approaching dog team pass. As it came closer he saw that it was the Allan and Darling team of Racers, and for the moment his eyes brightened with interest and admiration as he noticed with a true dog-lover's appreciation the perfect condition of the fleet-footed dogs, and the fine detail of sled and equipment. Then his glance fell upon Baldy--thin, rough coated, and showing evidences of neglect; upon Baldy to whom he could not now even offer food and shelter, and a wave of bitterness swept over him. "Come along, sonny, if you're going our way," and in the kindly little man at the handle-bars the boy recognized "Scotty" Allan, the most famous dog driver in Alaska. To the boy "Scotty" represented all that was most admirable in the whole North, and he stood speechless at the invitation to ride with him behind a team that had always seemed as wonderful as Cinderella's Fairy Coach. He hesitated, and then the Woman in the sled beckoned encouragingly. "Get in with me; and your dog may come too," she said as she rearranged the heavy fur robes to make room. The boy advanced with painful shyness, and awkwardly climbed into the place assigned him. The Woman laid her hand on Baldy's collar to draw him in also, but the boy exclaimed quickly, "No, ma'am, don't do that, please; he ain't really cross, but he won't ride in anythin' as long's he's got a leg to stand on; an' sometimes he growls if people he don't know touches him." "Dogs and boys never growl at me, because I love them; and he does not look as if he really had a leg to stand on," she replied smilingly. But the boy nervously persisted. "Please let him go--his legs is all right. He looks kind o' run down jest now 'cause he"--the boy felt a tightening at his throat, and winked hard to keep the tears from starting again--"'cause he ain't got much appetite. But when he's eatin' good his legs is jest great. Why, there ain't no other dog in Golconda that's got as strong legs as Baldy when he's--when he's eatin' good," he repeated hastily. "An' Golconda's plumb full o' fine dogs." "If that's so," said "Scotty," "I think I shall have to take a look at those Golconda wonders before the winter fairly sets in; and maybe you can give me a few pointers." For a mile or so the boy sat spellbound, drinking in the casual comments of "Scotty" upon the dogs in the team, as if they were pearls of wisdom dropping from the lips of an Oracle. He was not so much interested in the Woman's replies, for they displayed a lack of technical information that contrasted unfavorably in the boy's mind with the keen and accurate insight that Allan showed in every word on that most vital subject. Vaguely the boy remembered having once heard that she had become a partner in the racing team for mere amusement of the sport, instead of from a serious, high-minded interest, and that of course did not entitle her to the same respect you could feel for one to whom the care and culture of the dog assumed the dignity of a vocation. Then, too, she had spoken slightingly of Baldy's legs. As a human being he could not but respond to her friendly overtures, but as a dog fancier she held no place in his esteem. As they approached the divide where the trail for Golconda branched from the main road, an idea suddenly came to the boy. He had watched the harmony between Allan and his dogs; had noted their willingness, their affection for "Scotty," and his consideration for them. And as the pace became slower, and he realized that they were nearly at the end of this fate-given interview, he tremblingly gasped out the question that had been seething through his mind with such persistence. "Mr. Allan, would you like to buy Baldy?" "Buy Baldy!" exclaimed the man in surprise. "Why, I thought you and Baldy were chums--I had no idea he was for sale." "He wasn't till jest now, not till I saw how yer dogs love you; but I got t' git rid of him. It's been comin' fer a long time, an' I guess to-day's finished it." The man leaned over and looked into the tear-stained face. "Are you in some trouble about him? Perhaps it's not so bad as you think, and maybe we can help you without taking Baldy." But the boy went on determinedly. "No, sir, I want you to take him; it'd be the best thing fer him, an' I kin stan' it someway. A feller has ter stan' a lot o' things he don't like in this world, but I hope," feelingly, "all of 'em ain't as hard as givin' up his best friend." As if to avoid the sympathy he felt was forthcoming, he plunged hastily into the details that had led to the unexpected offer. "I'm Ben Edwards. Maybe you knew my father; he was killed in the cave-in on the June Fraction. Baldy was only a little pup then, but Dad was awful fond of him." "I remember," said the Woman thoughtfully; "and you have been in difficulties since, and need the money you could get for Baldy. Is that it?" "It ain't only the money, but none o' the men at the Camp care much fer Baldy, an' they ain't kind to him. Only Moose Jones. When he was here he wouldn't let the men tease Baldy ner me, an' he made the cook give me scraps an' bones ter feed him. An' once he licked Black Mart fer throwin' hot water on Baldy when he went ter the door o' Mart's cabin lookin' fer me. I think Moose Jones is the best man in the world, an' about the strongest," volunteered the boy loyally. "And where's Moose Jones now?" asked "Scotty." "I used to see him prospecting out near the Dexter Divide last winter." "He was at Dexter first, an' then he was at Golconda fer a while; but in spring he went ter St. Michael, an' from there up ter the new strike at Marshall." "And you miss him very much?" questioned the Woman. "Yes, ma'am, I miss him a lot, an' so does Baldy. He was awful good ter animals an' kids. He had a pet ermine that 'ud come in ter see him every night in his cabin, an' he wouldn't let Mart an' some o' the fellers set a trap fer the red mother fox that was prowlin' round the place t' git somethin' fer her babies. Said he'd make trap-bait fer bears o' the first feller that tried t' git 'er." "Excellent idea." "Oh, he didn't really mean it serious. Why, Moose is so kind he hates ter kill anythin'--even fer food. Sometimes when he's been livin' on bacon an' beans fer months, he lets a flock o' young ptarmigan fly by him 'cause he says they look so soft an' pretty an' fluttery he don't like ter shoot 'em; an' Moose is a dead shot. He's mighty handy with his fists too, an' next ter Mr. Allan I guess Moose knows more about dogs than any man in Alaska; an' he said he'd bet some day there'd be a reg'lar stampede ter buy Baldy." "A prophet," exclaimed the Woman. "You see we are the forerunners. But who is Black Mart?" "Oh, he's a miner that's workin' the claim next ter Golconda. He's a friend o' the cook there, an' comes over ter eat pretty often. Him and Moose had some trouble once over some minin' ground, an' Mart kinda takes it out on all Moose's friends, even if they's only boys an' dogs, don't he, Baldy?" And Baldy wagged that he certainly did. "Now the cook says they've got work dogs enough belongin' ter the claim ter feed, without supportin' my mangy cur in idleness. Mr. Allan," earnestly, "he ain't mangy, an' he's the most willin' dog I ever seen fer any one that loves him. But he ain't sociable with every one, an' he don't like bein' handled rough." "Scotty" looked at Baldy with a practiced and critical eye. "Those are all points in his favor," he remarked. "You can't do much with a dog that gives his affection and obedience indiscriminately." "Besides, he ain't no cur--he's one o' them Bowen-Dalzene pups, an' you know there ain't a poor dog in the lot. They give him to me 'cause he wasn't like any o' the others in the litter, an' would 'a' spoiled the looks o' the team when they was old enough ter be hitched up," continued Ben breathlessly. "He was sort o' wild, too, an' he wouldn't pay attention t' any of 'em when I was round, an' they said I might as well take him fer keeps as t' have him runnin' away t' git t' me all the time." "And your mother does not like him, and thinks it would be best not to keep him now?" "She really does like him; but she does the washin' fer the Camp, an' helps with the dishes, an' sews when she kin git a job at it. But there ain't none of 'em reg'lar, an' sometimes there ain't more'n enough fer us two t' live on. Then she gits pretty tired an' discouraged like, an' says Baldy's a useless expense, an' keeps me from doin' my chores, 'cause I like t' play with him, an'--" "Yes, yes, I see," broke in the Woman hastily, anxious to spare him any further revelations of a painful nature. "I know exactly how it is; but maybe we could make some arrangement with your mother about the dog. We will take a sort of an option on him; you can keep him with you, and we will pay a certain sum for the privilege of being permitted to buy him outright before the stampede actually begins." The boy looked at her suspiciously, but there was no smile on her lips, and she rose a notch in his estimation. She evidently did realize, in a slight degree, what an unusual bargain was being offered in his heart-breaking sacrifice. "An' it ain't 'cause his appetite's gone that makes him thin. I wasn't tellin' the truth about that," he stammered desperately; "he's jest _hungry_." The child's mouth quivered and he hesitated, yet he was determined to tell the whole of the sordid little tragedy now that he had begun. "But spendin' too much time with him when I should be workin' ain't the worst. To-day I done somethin' that mebbe she'll think ain't exac'ly square; an' my mother believes if you ain't square in this world you ain't much worth while." "You're not, son," agreed "Scotty" heartily. "Your mother's right." "My father was allers called Honest Ben Edwards out here on the Third Beach Line, an' Mother says she'd ruther have that mem'ry o' him than all the fortunes that's been made in Alaska by lyin' an' steal-in' an' jumpin' other people's claims." "Right again, Ben. Nothing can take that from her, and a name like that is the best thing a man can leave his son." "This mornin' she gave me some money fer a new pair o' mittens fer her, an' shoes fer me; an' the cook asked me t' buy a kitchen knife an' a few pans fer him. I walked inter town t' git 'em, an' Baldy come with me, though she said I was foolish t' be bothered with him. But I told her it was awful lonesome on the trail, an' she said I could take him this time." He paused for breath, visibly embarrassed. "And you forgot all about your errands," hazarded the Woman. "No, ma'am, I didn't exac'ly forgit, but when I was passin' the Court House an' I seen a big crowd inside, I went in, too, ter listen a minute. "That lawyer Fink, that got up the Kennel Club, an' has the bully dog team, an' Daly, the feller with the smile that makes you feel like there's sunshine in the room, was a-talkin' agin each other; an' their fightin' was so excitin' an' so smooth an' perlite too, that everybody was a-settin' on the edges o' their chairs a-waitin' fer what was a-comin' next." "So you were interested in what the lawyers had to say?" "Yes, sir. Ever since my mother told me the story about President Lincoln a while ago, I been wantin' t' be a lawyer when I grow up. He didn't have no more book-learnin' than me at first, but he wouldn't let nothin' stop him, an' jest see what he done." "Lincoln is to be your model, then? Well, you're right to aim high, Ben. You can practice his simple virtues of being honest and kind and industrious every day, and anywhere. And the education must be managed someway," added the Woman thoughtfully. "After Mother read me that speech o' Mr. Lincoln's at Gettysburg, when all the people was jest dumb from their feelin's bein' so solemn an' deep; an' some o' his other speeches that was fine, I begun t' go t' town whenever there was t' be any good speakin', even when I had t' walk both ways." "Shows your determination, as a starter," replied "Scotty" encouragingly. "And were you always repaid for your tramp?" "Most allers, Mr. Allan. Last Fourth o' July I heerd Judge Tucker tell in his pleasant voice 'at sounds like he likes talkin' t' you all that Virginia's done fer our country, an' I wished I was from Virginia too. But mebbe some day I'll make some boy wish he was from Alaska by bein' fine an' smart an' gentle like Judge Tucker." "Virginia or Alaska, Ben--it's all the same, so long as you're proud of your state, and give your state a chance to be proud of you." "Yes, ma'am; that's what Mother says. Then I heerd Tom Gaffney recitin' Robert Emmett's last speech, on St. Patrick's day, at Eagle Hall, an' I near cried at the end; an' I don't cry easy. It takes somethin' pretty bad t' make me cry," and he looked furtively toward Baldy. "I'm sure it does, sonny; any one can see that you're game, all right; but that speech always makes me cry too." The boy regarded "Scotty" appreciatively. Here was a typical Alaskan, a sturdy trailsman, touched by the tender, pitiful things of life, just like a little boy that hasn't had time to become hardened. Ben felt that they would be friends. [Illustration: SCOTTY AND BALDY] "I like all kinds o' speakin', too; not jest the fiery sort that makes you want t' fight fer your country, an' mebbe die fer it like Robert Emmett; but the kind that jest makes you want t' be good ter folks an' dogs, an' do the best you kin when things is agin you, an' you don't see much ahead--" The Woman nodded gravely. "Yes, I know. It's the most difficult sort of bravery--the sort without flags, and music, and cheers to keep you up to the firing line." "That's the kind, ma'am. Mebbe you know Bishop Rowe. That's what he preaches--jest doin' your best all the time, like you was in some big race. When he's in Nome I allers go t' St. Mary's. He talks plain an' simple, an' cheers you up--I guess kinda the way Lincoln talked--jest like he knew all about people's troubles an' didn't blame 'em fer mistakes, but wanted t' help 'em t' do better. Sometimes his talks don't sound smooth, an' made up beforehand, but you never forgit 'em." "Eloquence of the heart instead of the tongue," murmured the Woman. "An' last August I went every night fer near a week, when Mr. Wickersham was talkin' men inter sendin' him t' Washington, no matter what they felt an' said agin his goin' when he wasn't before 'em." "You have certainly had a variety of orators, and a wide range of subjects." "You kin see I ain't missed a single chanct t' hear any of 'em since I made up my mind t' be a great man"--and then appalled by his lengthy burst of eloquence the child colored violently and concluded in confusion--"an' this mornin' I got so interested in them speeches o' Daly's an' Fink's, I must 'a' lost all track o' time, fer when I come out it was noon, an' Baldy was gone." "You must indeed have been absorbed to forget Baldy. Where did you find him?" "One o' the school kids told me the pound-man had got him, so I went over t' the pound on the Sand Spit as fast as I could run. I explained t' the man that Baldy wasn't a Nome dog; that we live five miles out at Golconda--but he said he was gittin' pretty sick o' that excuse. That no boy's dog ever really lived in Nome, so fur's he could find out; that all of 'em was residin' in the suburbs, an' only come in t' spend a day now an' then." "It's a strange thing," mused the Woman, "that all pound-men are sarcastic and sceptical. It seems an inevitable part of their occupation. They never believed me when I was a little girl, either. Then what?" "He said the only thing that concerned him was that Baldy was in town when he found him, and hadn't no license. Besides, he thought the dog was vicious 'cause he growled when the wire was around his neck. Pretty near any dog 'ud do that ef he had any spirit in him; an' Baldy's jest full o' spirit." Both the Woman and "Scotty" looked involuntarily at Baldy who stood, dejected and uneasy; and then exchanged a glance in which amusement and pity struggled for expression. "The pound-man said ef I didn't pay the $2.50 t' git him out, an' another $2.50 t' git him a license, he'd sell the dog along with a lot o' others he'd ketched durin' the week. I tuk Mother's money, an' what the cook give me, an' got Baldy out, an' bought him a license so's he'd be safe nex' time. Now," sadly, "there ain't goin' t' be any nex' time." "There really did not seem to be any other way out of it for the moment," observed the Woman sympathetically. "No, ma'am, but it wasn't very honest t' use the cook's money, ner Mother's; it'll take a long time t' pay 'em back, an' I guess Mother won't have much patience with Baldy after this. I wouldn't mind gittin' punished myself, but I don't want him blamed. He'd be a lot better off with you, Mr. Allan; an' mebbe ef you'd feed him up, an' give him a chanct, he'd be a racer some day. He'd never lay down on you, an'," almost defiantly, "he's got good legs." "Scotty" felt the dog's legs, and noted the breadth of his chest. "What do you want for him, Ben?" "Would ten dollars be too much?" asked the boy, eagerly. "Ten dollars would be too little," quickly exclaimed the Woman. "You see we are getting ahead of all the others who do not know his fine points yet, and we should be willing to pay something extra for this opportunity. Do you think that twenty-five dollars would be fair, considering that we are in on the ground floor?" "Yes, ma'am, that's lots more'n I expected. But it ain't so much the money I'm gittin' as the home he's gittin' an' the trainin' an' all." "Well, that's a bargain, then; come to my husband's office--Darling and Dean, on Front Street, you know--the first time you are in town, and we will give you a check; and you can bring Baldy with you then." "I guess," slowly, "you'd better take him now. It 'ud be easier fer me t' let him go while I'm kinda worked up to it. Mebbe ef I thought about it fer a few days I wouldn't be able t' do it, an' he mightn't have another chanct like this in his whole life." He drew a frayed bit of rope from a torn pocket, and tied it to the old strap that served as Baldy's collar--handing the end to "Scotty." In the deepening shadows of the chill November dusk the boy's face was ashen. He stooped over as if to see that the knot in the rope was secure at the dog's neck--but the Woman knew in that brief instant the trembling blue lips had been pressed in an agony of renunciation against Baldy's rough coat. "Thank you both very much," he said in a tone that he tried to keep steady. "Thank you fer the ride and fer--fer everything." He did not trust himself to look at the dog again, but stepped quickly into the Golconda Trail. "You must come to see Baldy often," the Woman called to him. "Yes, ma'am, I'll be glad to--after a while," he replied gratefully. And then as "Scotty" gave the word to the impatient Racers, and the team swung round to return to Nome, there came to them out of the grayness a voice, faint and quavering like an echo--"Some day you'll be glad you've got Baldy." [Illustration] II Where Every Dog Has His Day [Illustration] [Illustration] CHAPTER II WHERE EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY Baldy's entrance into the Allan and Darling Kennel had failed to attract the interest that the arrival of a new inmate usually created. He was an accident, not an acquisition, and the little comment upon his presence was generally unfavorable. Even Matt, who took care of the dogs, and was a sort of godfather to them all, shook his head dubiously over Baldy. "He don't seem to belong here, someway," had been his mild criticism; while the Woman complained to "Scotty" that he was one of the most unresponsive dogs she had ever known. "He's not exactly unresponsive," maintained "Scotty" justly; "but he's self-contained, and it's hard for him to adjust himself to these recent changes. It's all strange to him, and he misses the boy. You can't watch him with Ben and say that he's not affectionate; but he gives his affection slowly, and to but few people. One must earn it." The Woman regarded Baldy with amused contempt. "So one must work hard for his affection, eh? Well, with all of the attractive dogs here willing to lavish their devotion upon us, I think it would hardly be worth while trying to coax Baldy's reluctant tolerance into something warmer." "Scotty" admitted that Baldy could hardly be considered genial. "He's like some people whose natures are immobile--inexpressive. It's going to take a little while to find out if it's because there is nothing to express, or because he is undemonstrative, and has to show by his conduct rather than by his manners what there is to him." It was true that Baldy was unmistakably ill at ease in his new quarters, and did not feel at home; for he was accustomed neither to the luxuries nor to the restrictions that surrounded him. His early experiences had been distinctly plebeian and uninteresting, but they had been quite free of control. Born at one of the mining claims in the hills, of worthy hard-working parents, he had, with the various other members of the family, been raised to haul freight from town to the mine. But his attachment for Ben Edwards had intervened, and before he was really old enough to be thoroughly broken to harness, he had taken up his residence at Golconda. Here his desultory training continued, but a lesson in sled pulling was almost invariably turned into a romp, so that he had only acquired the rudiments of an education when he came under "Scotty's" supervision. His complete ignorance in matters of deportment, and possibly, too, his retiring disposition, made him feel an intruder in the exclusive coterie about him; and certainly there was a pronounced lack of cordiality on the part of most of the dogs toward him. This was especially true of Tom, Dick, and Harry, the famous Tolman brothers, who were the Veterans of Alaska Dog Racing, and so had a standing in the Kennel that none dared question. That is, none save Dubby, who recognized no standard other than his own; and that standard took no cognizance of Racers as Racers. They were all just dogs--good or bad--to Dubby. The fact that Tom, Dick, and Harry had been in every one of those unique dashes across the snow-swept wastes of Seward Peninsula, from Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean and return, and had never been "out of the money," did not count greatly in his rigid code. The same distance covered slowly by freighters in pursuance of their task of earning their daily living would seem to him far more worthy of respect and emulation. And so, when the Tolman brothers, who were apt to be quarrelsome with those "not in their class," showed a coldness toward Baldy that threatened to break into open hostility at the slightest excuse, Dubby promptly ranged himself on the side of the newcomer with a firmness that impressed even Tom, Dick, and Harry with a determination to be at least discreet if not courteous. They had learned, with all of the others in the Kennel, to treat with a studied politeness--even deference--the wonderful old Huskie whose supremacy as a leader had become a Tradition of the North; and who was still in fighting trim should cause for trouble arise. He did not rely alone on his past achievements, which were many and brilliant, but he maintained a reputation for ever-ready power which is apt to give immunity from attack. Dubby's attitude toward the Racers generally was galling in the extreme. Usually he ignored them completely, turning his back upon them when they were being harnessed, and apparently oblivious of their very existence; except as such times when he felt that they needed suggestions as to their behavior. There was, in a way, a certain injustice in Dubby's contempt for what might be called the sporting element of the stable; for, like college athletes, they were only sports incidentally, and for the greater part of the year they were as ready and willing to do a hard day's work in carrying goods to the creeks as were the more commonplace dogs who had never won distinction on the Trail. But Dubby was ultra-conservative; and while "Scotty" must have had some strange human reason for all of these silly dashes with an absolutely empty sled, in his opinion hauling a boiler up to Hobson Creek would be a far more efficacious means of exercise, and would be a practical accomplishment besides. Dubby was of a generation that knew not racing. Of noted McKenzie River parentage, he came from Dawson, where he was born, down the Yukon to Nome with "Scotty" Allan. He had led a team of his brothers and sisters, six in all, the entire distance of twelve hundred miles, early manifesting that definite acknowledged mastery over the others that is indispensable in a good leader. He had realized what it meant to be a Pioneer, had penetrated with daring men the waste places in search of fame, fortune and adventure; and had carried the heavy burdens of gold wrested from rock-ribbed mountain, and bouldered river bed. He had helped to take the United States Mail to remote and inaccessible districts, and had sped with the Doctor and Priest to the bedside of the sick or dying in distant, lonely cabins. He and his kind have ever shared the toil of the development of that desolate country that stretches from the ice-bound Arctic to where the gray and sullen waters of Bering Sea break on a bleak and wind-swept shore. They figure but little in the forest-crowned Alaska of the South, with its enchanted isles, emerald green, in the sunlit, silver waves; but they are an indispensable factor in the very struggle for mere existence up beyond the chain of rugged Aleutians whose towering volcanoes are ever enveloped in a sinister shroud of smoke. Up in the eternal snows of the Alaska of the North, the unknown Alaska--the Alaska of Men and Dogs. [Illustration: THE ALASKA OF MEN AND DOGS June 1--The steamer Corwin at the edge of the ice, five miles from shore] And so it is not strange that in such a land where the dog has ever played well his rôle of support to those who have faced its dangers and conquered its terrors, that his importance should be at last freely acknowledged, and the fact admitted that only the best possible dogs should be used for all arduous tasks. Toward this end the Nome Kennel Club was organized. The object was not alone the improvement of the breeds used so extensively, but also, since the first President was a Kentuckian, of equal importance was the furnishing of a wholesome and characteristic sport for the community. And Nome, once famed for her eager, reckless treasure-seekers in that great rush of 1900; famed once for being the "widest open" camp in all Alaska, now in her days of peace and quiet still claims recognition. Not only because of the millions taken out annually by her huge dredgers and hydraulics; not only because she is an important trading station that supplies whalers and explorers with all necessary equipment for their voyages in the Arctic; not only because of her picturesque history; but because she possesses the best sled dogs to be found, and originated and maintains the most thrilling and most difficult sport the world has ever known--Long Distance Dog Racing. Previous to the advent of these races any dog that could stand on four legs, and had strength enough to pull, was apt to be pressed into service; but since they have become a recognized feature of the life there, a certain pride has manifested itself in the dog-drivers, and dog-owners, who aim now to use only the dogs really fitted for the work. Even the Eskimos, who were notorious for their indifferent handling of their ill-fed, overburdened beasts, have joined in the "better dog" movement, which is a popular and growing one. According to Dubby's stern law, however, most of the Racers--the long-legged, supple-bodied Tolmans, the delicately built Irish Setters, Irish and Rover, and numberless others of the same type, would have been condemned to the ignominy of being mere pets; useless canine adjuncts to human beings--creatures that were allowed in the house, and were given strangely repulsive bits of food in return for degrading antics, such as sitting on one's hind legs or playing dead. Occasionally there was, for some valid reason, an exception to his disapproval; as in the case, for instance, of Jack McMillan. For while he could not but deplore Jack's headstrong ways, and his intolerance of authority in the past, he nevertheless felt a certain admiration for the big tawny dog who moved with the lithe ease of the panther, and held himself with the imposing dignity of the lion. An admiration for the dog whose reputation for wickedness extended even to the point of being called a "man-eater," and was the source, far and near, of a respect largely tempered with fear. There was always an air of repressed pride about Jack when he listened to the thrilling accounts of his crimes told with dramatic inspiration to horrified audiences; a pride which is not seemly save for great worth and good deeds. Yet in spite of these grave faults of character Dubby accorded McMillan the recognition due his wonderful strength and keen intelligence; for Dubby, while intolerant of mere speed, was ever alert to find the sterner and more rugged qualities in his associates. Perhaps it was partly because Baldy possessed no trivial graces and manifested no disdain for the homely virtues of the work dogs whose faithfulness has won for them an honorable place in the community, that Dubby had soon given unmistakable signs of friendliness that helped to make Baldy's new home endurable. While Dubby's championship was a great comfort, there were many things of every-day occurrence that surprised and annoyed Baldy. Out of the bewilderment that had at first overwhelmed him he had finally evolved two Great Rules of Conduct, which he observed implicitly--to Pull as Hard as he Could, and to Obey his Driver. This code of ethics is perfect for a trail dog of Alaska, but it was in the minor things that he was constantly perplexed--things in which it was difficult to distinguish between right and wrong, or at least between folly and wisdom. To tell where frankness of action became tactlessness, and the renunciation of passing pleasures a pose. It was particularly disconcerting to see that virtue often remained unnoticed, and that vice just as often escaped retribution; and what he saw might have undermined Baldy's whole moral nature, but for the simple sincerity that was the key-note to his character. As an artless dog of nature he was accustomed, when the world did not seem just and right to him, to show it plainly--an attitude not conducive to popularity; and it often made him seem surly when as a matter of fact he was only puzzled or depressed. He could not feign an amiability to hide hatred and vindictiveness as did the Tolmans, and it was a constant shock to him to note how the hypocrisy of Tom and his brothers deluded their friends into a deep-seated belief in their integrity. Even after such depravity as chasing the Allan girl's pet cat, stealing a neighbor's dog-salmon, or attacking an inoffensive Cocker Spaniel, he had seen Tom so meek and pensive that no one could suspect him of wrong-doing who had not actually witnessed it; and he had seen the Woman, when she _had_ actually witnessed it, become a sort of accessory after the fact, and shield Tom from "Scotty's" just wrath, which was extraordinary and confusing. The confinement of a Kennel, too, no matter how commodious, was most trying. Even the vigorous daily exercise was "personally conducted" by Matt; and Baldy longed for the freedom that had been his when alone, or preferably with the boy, he had roamed through the far stretches of rank grass, tender willows, and sweet-smelling herbs in summer, or over the wide, snowy plains in winter. Then, later, the boy came to Baldy; and there were blissful periods when he would lie with his head on Ben's lap; when the repressed enmity of the haughty Tolmans, the cold indifference of the magnificent McMillan, and even Matt's eternal vigilance were forgotten. Periods when his companion's toil-hardened hands stroked the sleek sides and sinewy flanks that no longer hinted of insufficient nourishment; and caressing fingers lingered over the smooth and shining coat that had once been so rough and ragged. To see Baldy receiving problem, and understand that the world is not a sphere, but what is called an Oblate Spheroid, being flattened at the poles. As I cannot easily find out by weighing that a pound is not a pound: can you tell me any other way of proving that the earth is not quite round, dear father? Yes, I can. Do you see the reason why the pendulum returns down when it is moved up? The gravitation, to be sure. If a thing weighs heavier in one place than another through a difference of gravitation will there be a difference in the two places with the pendulum? I should fancy that where the earth pulled the harder the pendulum would come down the quicker. If it came down quicker it would rise quicker; that is, the beat would be quicker. What effect would this have upon the clock? The faster it beat, the faster the wheels would be moved, and the faster the hands would turn on the face. Just so: the clock would be faster in time when the pendulum beat quicker, and slower in time when the pendulum beat slower. But how could I find this out, father? This way. It is ascertained that in London a pendulum must be 39-1/7 inches from the top to the middle of the swinging-bob to beat a true second at a time. Then I am sure the London pendulum will not be pulled down so hard at the equator, and so it will be longer coming and going. What must I do, then, to make my London pendulum beat seconds on the equator? Why, shorten it a little bit. Yes; or, what is the same thing, move up the weight at the end of the pendulum a little. I must shorten it one-tenth of an inch, or else it will lose sixteen hours in the year. Then all the clocks carried to Melbourne from London will be wrong. Will they go too fast or too slowly in Victoria? They will be a little too slow, as Melbourne is nearer the equator than London is. If a Melbourne clock-maker want his second pendulum to beat seconds in London what directions must he give? He must tell the folks in London to lengthen the pendulum a bit. You will see that by the world being flattened at the poles the degrees of latitude will differ. One close to the equator measures 68-3/4 miles, in Victoria about 69 miles, in England 69-1/8, while in Lapland it would be 69-1/4. What would be the mean length of a degree? About 69-1/20 miles. Let me multiply that by 360, to find the mean circumference of the world; I have it--24,858 miles.” ANNUAL MOTION. The ship was much delayed in the Region of the Calms, as it is called; that is, near the equator. After a while the astronomical dialogue was resumed. “Well, James, look now at your twinkling friends, and tell where you are. I suppose by the North Polar star resting upon the waters to the north, that we must be now nearly on the top of the hill, by the equator. We are so, my lad. But what time did the sun rise this morning? At six, and it set at exactly six this evening. Do you know what day of the month it is? The twenty-third of September. Have you ever observed the sun to rise and set at six o’clock before, on the voyage? No, father. Well, then, you will recollect hereafter that you were upon the equator on the twenty-third of September, when there was equal day and night. But did you not know of equal day and night at home? Yes; about half-way between winter and summer. Just so; that is, at the end of September. Why should it be so there in England and here too? We will try and find out. I think I have pointed out to you the Pleiades. I know them well. They are in the Bull cluster. There happens to be a band of twelve constellations forming a broad circle of the heavens. Is that what is called the Signs of the Zodiac? The same. Can you repeat them? Yes, father. Aries the Ram, Taurus the Bull, Gemini the Twins, Cancer the Crab, Leo the Lion, Virgo the Virgin, Libra the Scales, Scorpio the Scorpion, Sagittarius the Archer, Capricornus the Goat, Aquarius the Water-bearer, Pisces the Fishes. Over there to the eastward is one of these that rose as the sun was setting. The sun is seen opposite one or other of the twelve constellations in each month of the year. It is observed, for instance, to rise each morning for a month in the constellation of the Ram, and for the next month in the Bull. How can it be among those stars when you say they are so much farther off? By saying it is in such a constellation, I mean that it is in a line between us and that cluster of stars. Why, then, the sun appears to go a journey between the stars and us for a whole year. Then it will rise in the Ram twelve months after it had been seen opposite that constellation. I wonder how this can be. Did you not say, father, that neither the stars nor the sun really moved? I did. Well, then, it must be either the stars turning about the sun, or the sun taking an annual trip about them, and yet the stars do not move, and the sun does not. Let us leave the sun and his trip for a little, while we have another talk about the stars. Notice that red star just rising there on the larboard side. I have it, father. As I want you to remember it, take my pocket-book and mark off with the pencil a picture of the star and its four neighbours, putting a cross under the one that has just risen. There it is,--the under one of this cluster I have sketched. I shall know him again. Now, then, you must go below, and resume your observations to-morrow. I took the exact time--seven p.m.--when you saw the star rise. You must look for it at seven to-morrow evening.” At four minutes before seven the next night, up rose the pretty object, and stole a glance at the boy across the ocean. “Father, father! it’s up, it’s up!” sang out the happy lad. His father looked at his watch, and said-- “Your star did not come to his time. It was four minutes to seven o’clock when he appeared, and that is four minutes too soon. How is that, father? I must ask you, for it is of no use asking the star. Perhaps you will still wonder when I tell you that to-morrow evening it will be eight minutes to seven before it gets up at this place. Why, this is like the sun among the stars--always getting out of his place. But the sun gets right after a year. Do you think our star will ever get right--so as to rise at seven some other evening? I do not know, father. If it rise four minutes earlier every day when will it be an hour earlier? In half-a-month; and twenty-four hours earlier in twelve months. But that is the time when it will be visiting at night again. So you have ascertained that the stars go an apparent journey round the earth in a year; like as the sun takes a year to go his apparent course among the stars. Then both must have the same cause. As I found the daily motion of the stars was owing to the real daily motion of the earth, I suppose this yearly motion of the stars must be caused by some yearly motion of the earth. Either the sun turns round the earth once a year, or the earth does round the sun. Well, father, the sun appeared also to turn round the earth once a day. I do not think I could run round the deck in two minutes while I am two hours doing it. Then, as I am satisfied it did not have a daily motion, I am the more disposed not to trust to this apparent yearly motion. It is more likely, too, that the little world should run round the great sun, than that the great sun should revolve round the earth. I perceive you are as settled upon the annual or yearly motion as you were upon the diurnal or daily revolution.” THE SEASONS. “James, my boy,” said Mr. Marple “do you know why there should be winter and summer? No, father, I really cannot tell. I know that in England the sun was higher up in the day, and that he stopped up longer in summer than in winter. But then as I believed that the sun ran about as he liked, I was not surprised at his change of place. Now, however, I am very anxious to know more about this subject. When were we in the circle of the Pleiades, that is, the place where at some time or other of the twenty-four hours they would be overhead? O, that was long before we got to the equator. Yes, it was about 1500 miles to the north of us. Now we are in the circle of the Virgin cluster. But the Bull and the Virgin belong to the twelve constellations, of which we were talking, forming a broad circle, along which the sun appears to travel. True. But they are not in an upright circle. Their line will cross our equator Line. If that be it, the sun does not appear, then, to go round us over the equator. No; for if it did, it would be seen overhead at that place every day at twelve o’clock; whereas it shifts its course continually. One day it is over one part at noon, and upon another day over another part. Why, if the circle of the Zodiac be inclined to the circle of the equator, it will cross it in two places. I suppose that is the reason why, on the celestial globe, one constellation, as the Virgin, is over the equator circle; others, as the Bull, over some place to the north of it; and some others, as the Scorpion, to the south. You guess rightly. Then if that be it, the sun must appear to cross the equator twice in the year. It does so on the 21st of March and 23rd September. These are the vernal or spring equinox, and the autumnal equinox. March is the vernal equinox of London, or equal day and night in spring; but it is the Australian autumnal equinox. In September the Australias have the spring equinox, and the English the autumnal. The sun is seen overhead to the furthest north on the 21st of June, and to the furthest south on the 21st of December. Why, the first is the summer of England, and the last the winter. Then I suppose that is the reason why in summer the sun looks so high up at noon. Then in winter, as it is shining more over parts south of the equator, the north would neither see nor feel so much of him. That is correct. You now see why the Australian summer is at the time of the English winter. Yes, father; because they are on opposite sides of the equator. But you know that the sun does not really move about like this. I want to know what does move. The earth, to be sure. I understand that; but neither the rotundity nor motion seems to explain this mystery of the Zodiac. But let me see. When the world swings round the master light, is it obliged to keep bolt upright--north pole up and south pole down? How would your equator then be, James? Right opposite the sun. But that will not do, for it is not always opposite to the sun. Perhaps the world goes waddling along like a duck, first on one side a little bit, and then on the other. This would bring the sun opposite to either place. It would be a very regular waddle. We will try your scheme. Pick up that round wooden ball there. Carry it round the capstan, and see whether by twisting it from one side to the other you can keep the south pole shone upon for six months, and the north pole shone upon for the other six months.” James now makes a trial. But after all sorts of turns he failed in producing the English winter and summer in the proper time and for the proper length of time. “I must give it up, father. Just slant your ball a little out of the perpendicular, and carry it round your sun without moving it from its position. Capital! It explains the whole. When it was in front of the capstan, the south pole was toward it; that was the Australian summer. When I went to the right side, neither end was inclined toward it; this was the sun over the equator. When I came to the back of it, the north pole was toward it; this was the English summer. When I reached the left side, my equator was opposite to it; this was the sun’s second crossing of the Line. When I got to the front again, there was my south pole pointing to the capstan again. Then you really understand the seasons. Of course the spring in England is the autumn of Australia. But I have something else to recall to your recollection. Have you forgotten the old church on the hill at home? No, father, and never shall. How pretty it looked when the sun rose over it upon a fine spring morning, with the birds all alive with their song, and the bees down upon the flowers! Did the sun rise over the church at hay harvest? No; I remember then it came up from behind the squire’s house to the left of it. Where was the sun first seen upon a cold winter’s morning? Aye, I fancy I see his red face looking lazily over the parsonage to the right of the church, and that when we had done breakfast, too. How came the sun to jump about in that manner? Why, do you see, he did not hop from one side to the other. He would get a little further from the church each morning till he rose over the squire’s house: then, as if ashamed, he seemed to creep back to his old place. Afterwards he appeared to take it into his head gradually to get on to the parsonage, and then he would once more turn to the church. Which was on the north-side of the church, James? The squire’s house. Now, I think I can explain all without your questions this time, my dear father. Then go on by all means. The sun rose over the squire’s house in summer, for that was the north side; the north pole was then inclined to the sun. At spring it was half-way between the squire’s and the parsonage; this was the sun over the equator. In winter the sun rose at the furthest part to the south; this was where the north pole was turned away, and the south side turned to the sun. Well, then, you have satisfactorily explained the seasons.” PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES. It was with no little impatience that James had waited for the first appearance of the Southern Cross, the emblem of Australia. He first noticed it when a long way north of the equator, and each evening afterwards bestowed a considerable attention upon it. As he made southing on his voyage the glorious constellation rose higher and higher in the heavens. Hour after hour would he sit, marking its progress, wondering much to see it more or less upright according to the time of night, and more or less declining from the perpendicular at the same returning hour of evening upon different days. James could understand the Cross seeming to perform a circle round the south pole of the heavens, as he had seen the Bear round the north pole, from the rotundity of the earth and its daily motion. It was quite natural, then, that the lad should be so enthusiastic when he spoke of the constellation to his father in these terms: “O that pretty Southern Cross! I like it more and more as I get down to the south. I did feel sad to see the old Bear drop gradually, night after night, till it seemed to sink for ever in the northern Atlantic; but I have a new friend here, that keeps rising higher and higher each night, as if to welcome us to our southern home. How it would please many boys in Europe to see the Cross! But it was seen in Europe formerly. Another puzzle, dear father. Did it run away from the south pole to have a look at the north one? It was not a run, but a gradual slide out of its place, and as gradual a slide back into it again. What a queer trick! Is it on its rambles now, I wonder? It is always on the move. Yes; I know it describes a circle in the sky once in twenty-four hours, but that is owing to the world rolling over to get its daily light. Yet it has another motion; not really its own any more than the other. And this leads it further away from the central point over our south pole, and then brings it to its place again. Well, I am glad it is here now for me. Will there be time for my London cousins to catch a glance at it when it wanders northward again? O no, no; it does not move quite so fast as that. But if Abraham had been sojourning in southern Europe, instead of Asia, he could have seen it, though it was then making its way back to the south. How could the Cross slip away from the other southern stars to go on such migrations? Not so. All the stars keep their places relatively to each other, as you see them do in the nightly progress from east to west. In the daily motion none get before the other, nor did the Cross get before its neighbours. Well, I am fairly done. That is a riddle. Look at the question, boy. What makes the apparent daily motion of the stars? The real daily motion of the earth. And if, then, you observe any other peculiarity of movement among your bright friends up there, to what may you reasonably ascribe it? I should imagine some peculiar twist, roll, or slipping of this world of ours. True. And if there be seen among the polar stars, north as well as south, a slight but regular movement, a sort of a swing round, so that some stars get farther off the spot we call the south pole of the heavens, while others approached it nearer, and yet so swung round that at last all find their old places again, how could you get a motion of the earth to make up for all that? Ah! I must contrive that the world should do three things. It must roll over once a day, roll round the sun once a year, and yet wriggle about in another way at the same time.--Stop a bit--I have it. My top turns round itself, and pretty quickly, too; it shifts about on the floor almost in a circle as it turns round; and I see it, especially when it is quietly spinning, have a slow roll of the head, like a sailor when walking ashore, as if its head were a little giddy. You have hit it exactly, my good fellow. The three motions of your top are much like the three motions of the world. That top-heavy slow swinging of your top while it is spinning in full force is like a sort of head-rolling of the earth. The poles seem to have a roll of their own, independent of the regular roll. Yes; and that would make the Polar stars seem as though they were swinging. But how long are they before they are in their regular places again? Astronomers calculate 25,850 years. But will not this changing make the star-charts of the ancients all wrong? Indeed it does. Aries the Ram, for instance, as a _sign_, is the first thirty degrees on the celestial globe; but as a _constellation_ it has shifted to between the thirtieth and sixtieth degree on the ecliptic. This is called the precession of the Equinoxes. How is that? I know when the equinoxes are--March 21st and September 23rd--when it is equal night all over the world. The European vernal equinox took place at the first point of Aries. But by this precession, or more properly recession, or going backward of the stars, the Equinox takes place when the sun is in Taurus the Bull, two thousand years after it was in the Ram. I see. The stars not only get earlier four minutes a-day to accommodate the earth in its annual motion, but make a change to accommodate the swinging of its pole. Can you tell me, James, how much the stars slip back in a year? Let me calculate it. There are 360 degrees in a circle, and sixty times as many minutes; that is, 21,600. As it is 25,000 years in the circle, the stars would not shift one minute of distance, and the sun’s apparent size in the heavens is thirty minutes, or half-a-degree. By this Precession a star comes to the same spot about twenty minutes later every year. It is, as it were, sliding back. In Europe, James, one effect has been to bring what we call the Polar star within one degree of the north pole of the heavens; whereas, a few thousand years ago it was twelve degrees off it. The bright star of the Lyre Constellation will some day be the North Polar star. Ah, but in 25,000 years the present Polar star will be in its old place. The end of the little Bear’s tail seems now fastened on the north pole; but it must be a sort of greasy pole for the stars to slip off it as soon as they get near it.” FIXED STARS NOT FIXED. It had been a sultry day. The sun rose with a fiery glance, and the sea blushed with a deep red as his hot beams glided over the heaving surface. The clouds hung heavily and gloomy in one part of the horizon, sending back to the sun a glowing, angry look in exchange for his fierce gaze. It was not long before the massive clouds came rolling up, as they were pressed forward by the western breeze, which was rushing forward as hastily as the rest. The sun tried to frighten the advancing vapours, but could not. They came onward till they covered the sky, and drove the bright rays from the gilding of the waters. The wind, rejoicing in its power to drive the clouds, now flew upon the ocean and buffeted the waves. Affrighted at its blows, they fled hither and thither in their distress, and mingled their roar of terror with the shrill shrieks and cries of their invisible foe. It was a storm. The captain, who had been attentively watching the signs, and losing his breakfast, saw what was coming, and prepared for it. The sails were taken in, and the ship made snug and safe. The storm came with a wild burst all at once, and reeled the vessel almost upon its side. But the officer was there, the helmsman was awake to his duty, and the lounging barque kept on her course in spite of her erratic movements. James was not insensible to fear. He was but a boy. And when, in addition to the noise of wind and billows, the thunders came pealing from the heavens, he instinctively clapped his fingers to his ears, as if to drown the sound and his fears. The vivid stream of lightning, as it darted from cloud to cloud, played round the ship, or plunged madly into the sea, added to the interest and the terror. But the echoes died away to whispers. The clouds put on their snowy robes. The ripples gently laughed on the bosom of the ocean. The sun, no longer angry, smiled kindly upon the scene. In the evening, a few lines of vapour were motionless in the sky; and the long, uncertain heavings of the waters told that a calm was softly ruling all. The boy was found by his father looking at the placid face of the heavens. “What, boy! at your old post, staring at Orion again. I’ll tell you what I was thinking of, father. You see the world is like this ship--always on the rock, never really still--and I was thinking how pleasant rest is, and what a lot of it they must get up there in the fixed stars. Not so; we are now learning that they are, like some boys, not so steady as they look. You surely don’t mean to say that such respectable old folks as Sirius and his bright friends ever go dancing about in the heavens like giddy Venus and Mercury? I know they appear to tumble about over our masts in a storm at night, but that is because the ship is rolled over by the winds and waves. It is really true that they do not keep to their places, though the change of position is so very slight as not easily to be discovered. Your friend Sirius, for instance, has been closely watched, Dog as he is, for two thousand years. We know what his place was that time ago, and what it is now; and it has shifted to the southward half-a-degree. That is as much as the apparent diameter of the sun. But has he any company in his rambles? Yes; the _Bull’s_ Eye, Aldebaran, has kept up pace with him. Quite right to have an Eye upon the Dog. But has any exact difference of position been observed since we have had good telescopes? The star sixty-nine of the _Swan_ has been well watched for fifty years, and found to have gone on four minutes--the eighth part of the moon’s face. A star in the _Indian_ has moved seven seconds in the year. They are not fixed, like the ancients thought they were, in a crystalline sphere; or riveted, as Aristotle taught. Pray, is our sun no more fixed than the rest of them? He, too, is on the move. But where are they all going to? That has been a matter of dispute. Some thought the stars were dancing round Sirius. But Mädler, the German astronomer, would have us believe that they have a greater fancy for some spot near the _Pleiades_. Others think of Hercules. But all would take many millions of years.” DISTANCES AND SIZES OF THE STARS. James had a long talk with the captain one day about the telescope, and got a capital lesson about the magnifying power being according to the character and size of the glasses used. The sailors called the instrument the “Bring ’em near;” and it does make distant objects look as if near. It was explained to the boy that the stars were of different magnitudes or sizes, first, second, third, &c., according to their relative distances. The following conversation followed between the father and son:-- “Now, my boy, I must try and give you some idea of the penetrating power of light, that you may get an idea of the enormous distances of the stars. You are aware that the more distant they are the less their light. A star of the first or nearest magnitude will have one hundred times the light of one of the sixth magnitude. A telescope, therefore, gathering one hundred times the ordinary light, will make the sixth look as near as the first. And will it be one hundred times further off? No; light increases or diminishes according to the square of the distance. I know. If the light be one hundred times less, the star will be ten times further off, for the square of ten is one hundred. I can understand now that a thing is only seen by the help of light. I do not see many stars, because their light is too little for my eyes to take in. The telescope has bigger eyes to take in the light of the distant stars and nebulæ. The pupil of the eye is but one-eighth of an inch in diameter. An object glass of twelve inches diameter is, therefore, ninety-six, or say one-hundred times as long. As the light seen is according to the square of the diameter, the telescope of twelve inches will receive one hundred times one hundred, or ten thousand times more light. But is there a way of measuring the quantity of light? There is. We find that the sun has twenty-two thousand millions of times more light than the nearest of the fixed stars. Then, the square root of this ought to tell how much further off it is. Let me see. It will be about 150,000. Yes. If the sun were put back 150,000 times further than it is, it ought to look as brightly as that star. If it does not, it is because it is really smaller than the star. What! 150,000 times 95 millions! But that is nothing; for it is only to the first rank. What of the twentieth magnitude? Yes. But you say the nebulæ are further off than that. I may tell you that if the sun moved three times as fast as the world does, in its six hundred millions of miles a year, it would take two hundred and fifty millions of years to get to as far as Lord Rosse’s telescope could see. That takes my breath away. Hear a little more. Light comes from the sun to us in eight minutes. It will take sixty thousand years to come from one of those stars Lord de Rosse saw. In fact his telescope has enlarged our universe one hundred and twenty-five million times. Then I think religious people ought to thank astronomers for showing them more of the greatness of God. Those who only thought of him as the Creator of the three thousand stars, to be seen by the naked eye, could not have such a notion of his vast power as those who know of millions upon millions of suns.” * * * * * After this, James was left to digest such wonderful lessons. When his first astonishment had passed away, his curiosity was excited to know more about the distances of the stars, so that he might form a simpler idea of the thing. He took, therefore, another occasion of bringing up the subject in these words:-- “Father, do you really believe the stars are so far off? I am obliged to believe many things I do not understand, upon the testimony of trustworthy witnesses; but in this case I can form a good guess of the truth. Do you remember what I once told you of the parallax, or angle of observation of the sun or moon? Yes. That of the moon was 57 minutes, and the sun 8-3/4 seconds. A degree is 60 minutes, and a minute 60 seconds. Very well. Then 57 minutes, or 3420 seconds, will be four hundred times as much as the other. If the moon be 240,000 miles off, the sun will be four hundred times further or 96,000,000. But how do you get this parallax? Distances are calculated by the angle made in looking at an object from two places. The two lines of sight cross one another. A great base is needed to view a distant object, or else no angle can be observed. Astronomers take the diameter of the earth’s orbit. That is twice ninety-five millions of miles. With that base--that is, looking at a star from both sides of our orbit, or at six months’ interval--we could get the two lines crossing one another, and so making an angle. The further the object, the more minute the angle. Only a few of the fixed stars could be observed in this way, as they generally are too far off to give an angle. I know an equilateral triangle has its three angles equal to two right angles; and with ninety degrees for one right angle, each angle of the triangle will have sixty degrees. But I suppose no star parallax could be one degree. No; nor a minute, the sixtieth part of one degree. When the object makes an angle of a second, or sixtieth of a minute, from a base line of one hundred and ninety millions of miles, the distance of the star will be about twenty millions of millions of miles. Is there any star making the second angle? The _alpha_ of the Centaur is about that, and is one of the nearest of fixed stars. That the nearest to us, and yet so far! Do tell me the distance of some others. There is one, 61 Cygni, of the Swan, with one-third of a second; and, therefore, three times the distance of the _alpha_ Centaur. There is a star in the Lyre which is one-fifth of a second. Grand Arcturus is one-eight. The North Polar Star is one-tenth. Pretty Capella, of the Kid, is one-twentieth; that is, twenty times farther back than _a_ Centaur. As it looks one of the brightest stars, it must be very large. What of old Sirius? The angle he makes with our orbit diameter is one-fourth of a second; so that he is about 80,000,000,000,000 miles. Thank you, dear father, for these terrible long figures. Their great distance may give us a good guess of their great size. I know the size of the sun to be half-a-degree in the heavens, at a distance of ninety-five millions of miles, and yet it is really eight hundred and eighty-six thousand miles diameter, I have been told. When, then, a star is millions of millions of miles away, I am sure it must be a big one to be seen at all. It is so. If the sun were thrust back as far as the star _a_ Centaur, it is calculated that it would not shine with more than one-third of the light that star now gives us; it must, therefore, be not more than one-third its size. But you said Sirius was four times farther off than the Centaur, father. Yes; and it gives four times as much light. It is, then, probably four times as large. It must be, therefore, many times larger than the sun. I am sure it ought to have more planets turning round it than the sun has, or else have them much larger in size.” CONSTELLATIONS. It was a calm, still, moonless night, which closed in with raven wings a glorious sunset in the South Atlantic ocean. The gay clouds, in brilliant dress, that hung about the sun as he glowed to his evening rest, had gradually changed their garments for those of more sombre hues; and then, as gradually, had changed from mountain shapes to feathery forms, till softening night dissolved them into invisible vapour. The stars came stealthily forth; a few bolder ones rushing first to the front, while the more modest stars feared to show themselves till the last sign of daylight fled. First, second, third, fourth, and other magnitudes thus successively gleamed from the cloudless arch, above and around the boy. After a time he said-- “Why were the Ram, Bull, Lion, Scorpion and others so called? I have often wondered at their odd names, and have tried to make out a bear in the Great Bear, or a dog about the stars near Sirius, but never could see any resemblance to the animals. I don’t wonder at your surprise. Some learned astronomers of our day pretend that the ancients by the Nile and Euphrates had no meaning in the names they gave to the constellations. This is not likely, especially as we know that the signs of the Zodiac were pictured in their temples. But who gave the names to the other stars that are not signs of the Zodiac? The ancients. But it is time now to sleep away all thought of the stars in the care of Him who cares for the stars.” * * * * * During the night our young friend had a disturbed rest. The constellations kept circling round him; while lions, bulls, fish and crabs were mingled, in strange confusion. They glared at him with their hollow eyes till the boy was quite frightened, and cried out in his sleep. The morning sun awoke the boy, and put to flight the stars. When sweet evening came the twinkling lights stole forth again, and the astronomical dialogue was renewed by James. “Please, father, I want to know the various constellations. We will class them, my son, into North Polar, South Polar, and Equatorial. The North Polar star, at the end of the Little Bear’s tail, is a capital guide for the north pole; but I don’t see any Little Bear southward, walking round his tail-tip, like a horse tethered in a paddock, so that I may discover the south pole. No, we have not a South Polar star, and no bright stars at all near the south pole of the heavens. Let us have a little more about the Zodiac first, father. I know the twelve signs are constellations over the tropics; but I don’t know why you call them the Zodiac. Zodiac is from a Greek word, meaning a small figure of an animal, as they are nearly all animal figures. How many northern and southern constellations are there? In the ancient celestial atlases we find twenty-one northern and fifteen southern, besides the Zodiac; then more were added of new ones named or old ones subdivided, till we have, including the Zodiac, sixty-two northern and fifty-five southern constellations. Of course, the old astronomers of Egypt and Babylon could not have seen all the south polar stars? We should hardly fancy it. Strange tricks have been played with the names of the constellations. Only think of English writers, sixty years ago, wanting to have your Orion called Nelson; and the University of Leipsic, to please the French emperor, proposed to steal the belt and sword from Orion, and call them the constellation of Napoleon. I am glad they didn’t, though. But how is the line drawn to distinguish the spaces of the constellations? Their sizes vary. Orion, for instance, takes up a great space in the heavens, while others occupy little room. How many stars go to make up a constellation? You mean those seen by the naked eye. These differ in number. I will run over some of the Zodiac. Aries has 66, Taurus 141, Gemini 83, Cancer 85, Leo 95, Virgo 110, Libra 51, Scorpio 44, Sagittarius 69, Capricornus 51, Aquarius 108, Pisces 113. But there must be a lot more seen in them by the telescope. Yes. The six stars of the Pleiades turn out to be 188. In Orion there are 2000 stars easily distinguished. Your three in the belt are 80, and the star in the sword you find to be a dozen. Will you kindly show me, dear father, how I can find the south pole of the heavens, as there is no bright star near it? I will try and give you a rough chart. Look at the Southern Cross. Draw an imaginary line from the top star through the one at the foot; and four times that distance in the same line will bring you to the south pole of the heavens. Yes; and if I had that point over my head I should be where no one else has been--at the south pole of the earth. Now I have my centre, I would like to describe a circle at the distance of the Cross and know the stars inside of it. Begin, then. Look at the two bright ones pointing toward the Cross beside it. They are the Pointers to the Cross. A lot of bright stars together, on the other side of the Cross, are in the Ship, Argo. Follow on the circumference that way, and you arrive at a large star, a little north of our course, called Canopus. From the Cross to Canopus is one-quarter of the circle round the pole, and it is filled up with the Ship. What a ship! It goes northward, too, to Sirius, the Dog-star. Canopus is half-way between Sirius and the south pole, and is in the line between the two. That is a capital point, for I know them. South of the Ship, between it and the pole, are the little Flying Fish. The Table Mountain and Chameleon, with feeble stars, are between the Fish, again, and the poles. Now I have that quarter of the circle, well. Keep on to the right, still away from the Cross and beyond Canopus, nearly as far again, and you see a bright star in our circle, which is called Achernar, at the bottom of the long River Po. Not the Italian river, but the Celestial one. That heavenly stream runs northward to Orion. Now, between Canopus and Achernar we see but few stars, although we pass the constellations of the Painter’s Easel, Rhomboidal Net, and Clock. Between Achernar and the Pole are the tiny stars of the Little Hydra. But between the Little Hydra and the Flying Fish, resting like on the Table Mountain, is the beautiful Nubecular Major, the great Magellanic Cloud. Now I know where I am again. The Rhomboidal Net is on one side of the Cloud, and the Flying Fish on the other. The Table by the Pole is south of it. But what is north of it, for Canopus is not quite in a line with the Cloud and the Pole? The Sword Fish is on the Cloud. But go again to Achernar, and draw a line thence to the Pole. Why, it goes right through the Little Magellanic Cloud. That Cloud is between the Hydra and the Toucan. That bird’s head beyond Achernar is in our circumference of the Cross. A little further on that round line is the bright star in the Peacock’s head; though the Indian, with his arrows, stands between the Peacock and the Toucan. The very place for a hunter. But go on, please, for you are fast completing the circle, by getting back to the Cross. The end of the Peacock’s tail brings us three-fourths round; and above it, from the Pole, is the Southern Crown. I see it; but it ought to hang over something better than a Peacock’s tail. It so happens that the Telescope comes between them. Below the Peacock, and close round the south pole, is the constellation Octant. Now for the last quarter, between the Cross and the Peacock. I know part of that--the Cross’s Pointers. But what are those three stars a little below the Pointers, toward the Peacock? They are the Southern Triangle. Between the Cross and the Pole is the Fly; while between the Triangle and the Pole is the Bird of Paradise. What a cold place to put so delicate a bird! But to what constellation do the two Pointers to the Cross belong? To the Centaur’s two fore feet. The last of my circumpolar stars are those of the Altar, lying north of the Triangle, a little to the left of the Pointers. You may see them on the edge of the Milky Way--two stars close together, and four others to the right further apart. The Compasses, hardly to be noticed, are between the Altar and the Pointers.” * * * * * This was a long lesson, requiring much study afterwards. When Mr. Marple thought the lad knew the southern stars near the pole, he was ready to advance with the constellations again, and proposed to take a fresh round. “We will,” said he, “take another sweep round the heavens, embracing the space between our old circle of the Cross and that over the equator, though I will not take equatorial stars now. May we begin at the Crown, father? Between the Cross and Crown is the Altar. North of and near the Crown is Sagittarius the Archer, beside which is the Scorpion. How can I tell that? The Scorpion has a line of bright stars coming down south to the Altar, with a twist like a curl in its tail. What is that bright red star at the upper end of it? Antares of the Scorpion. The bright star near it further north is in the Libra or Scales. The fine star as far from the Pointers as they are from the Pole is in the shoulder of the Centaur, half horse and half man. Is he fighting anything? Yes; he is running his spear through the mouth of the Wolf, which is stretched between Antares and the Pointers. The Centaur comes down to the Cross, and goes up north to the great Hydra, on which the Crow is perched. What a beautiful star that is over Centaur, about twice as far from the Cross as that from the Pole! That is Spica in the Virgin, close to the Crow. That makes up one quarter of our second circle. Looking still to the right, and north of the Cross, do you see any good-sized stars? No, father, there is nothing worth looking at for the next quarter beyond the Cross and Ship till we get to Sirius. Yet there are the Pneumatic Pump and the Mariner’s Compass. The great Hydra stretches itself all from the Scorpion, under the Crow, the Cup, and the Sextant, from near Antares to Canis Minor, the Little Dog. Where is the Little Dog? To understand that we must go on to our third quarter of the circle. You know Sirius and the three starred belt of Orion. The Belt is exactly over the equator. The three stars lead you down south to Sirius, and a line at right angles brings you to Procyon of the Little Dog, which thus forms a triangle with Sirius and the Belt. Get the Pole, Canopus, and Sirius in a line, and a little further to the north, on the one side you have the Belt, and on the other Procyon. Though I see no stars of any consequence between the Great and Little Dogs, is there any constellation there? Monoceros, the Unicorn, keeps them apart. The Hare and Noah’s Dove are on the other side of Canis Major. They are both south of Orion. In the Dove, a little out of the line half-way from Canopus to Sirius, is the pretty Phact. The five stars in a line between Canopus and Sirius are in Canis Major, the Great Dog Constellation. What a gay show of stars between the Pole and Orion! But what a blank beyond to the right. I see one, however, opposite to Sirius, forming a parallelogram with it, the Belt, and Phact. That is Zaurack, in the River Po; and the great space beyond that, to the right, far north of Achernar, is Cetus the Whale. The star Menkar or Menhab, a little north of Zaurack, is in the Whale’s head, while Diphda is in its tail. Achernar is about half-way from Diphda to the Pole. Between the two are the Chemical Furnace, the Sculptor, and the Phoenix. I don’t care about these. Have you not nearly got round, father? The last quarter of our circle lies between the Southern Crown and the Whale’s tail. That will be north of the Peacock and Indian. What is the bright star between the Whale’s tail and Achernar? The head of the Phoenix. And forming a triangle with it and the tail is the noble Fomalhaut of the Southern Fish, under the sign Pisces and near the toe of Aquarius. The Goat Capricornus is to the right of Fomalhaut. Why, there is nothing hardly between Fomalhaut and the Crown. Between the Peacock and the Crown are the two stars close together, forming the foot of Sagittarius, whose body stretches from the Crown to Capricornus; while the Crane and the Microscope lie between the Peacock and Fomalhaut. It would require a good telescope to see that faint-looking Microscope. You will see seven stars in a line, left of the Peacock, dipping down toward the Pole--these form the Crane. And a long-necked fellow it is, too.” * * * * * Another rest was necessary here, to enable James to connect in his mind the last collection of constellations with his circumpolar ones. His father then took him to those about the equator and north of it, and thus introduced him to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. “You have learned, my dear boy, the names of these signs; I want now to teach you their positions. Yes; I would like to know how big the Bull is. Do his horns poke the polar star, while he hangs his tail over the equator? Our Bull is a funny one, for he has no tail, because he has no hind quarters. If he reached from the pole to the equator, a few Bulls would fill up the sky, and leave no room for Bears, Swans, Hunters, and other creatures up there. Now look at the Orion’s Belt, and run down the line of the three stars as you did to Sirius, but in the opposite direction, as far north as the other is south. I have it--a beautiful star between the Belt and the pretty Pleiades. That is Aldebaran, the Bull’s eye. Your Pleiades are in the Bull’s neck. The Hyades are the cluster near the eye. What is the great star, a little out of the road, between Aldebaran and the Belt? That is Betelgeux, in the shoulder of Orion, who is looking up to the Bull. Betelgeux is on the north side of the Belt; and Rigel, of Orion’s heel, is at the same distance to the south of the Belt. Aldebaran, Rigel, and Menkar, of the Whale’s nose, form an equilateral triangle. Aries the Ram is to the right of the Bull, near where his tail should be, and Orion is to the left or east, but a little southerly. But now for the Twins. Are they the two right north of Procyon, and forming the corner of a right-angled triangle with Betelgeux and Procyon? They _are_ the Twins, Castor and Pollux, though the latter is the larger. Cancer the Crab is to the left of the Twins. I cannot see so much as the claw of him. But I see a splendid star further to the left, with Procyon between it and the Belt. That is Regulus in Leo the Lion. It is one of his forepaws, and beyond to the left is Deneb, of the Lion’s tail. The little lion is north of Leo, and between it and the Great Bear, the favourite constellation of England. Virgo the Virgin should come next. I can see Spica, which is twice as far from the Cross northward as the Cross is from the Pole. Spica is in the ear of corn held in the Virgin’s hand. The Virgin’s head touches the Lion’s tail at Deneb. What a tall lady she must be! But what is that staring star forming the head of a triangle with Deneb and Spica? The Arcturus of Job, in the knee of Bootes the Husbandman, standing on Mount Moenalus. The small stars between Arcturus and Deneb are in the hair of Berenice. The Northern Crown, between Hercules and Bootes, is seen nearly overhead in England. You have got a long way from us now, father. Please come back to the Virgin. Well, then, you know the Southern Crown, at any rate. Sagittarius is right over it northward, while Antares of Scorpio is to the right a little. The stars of Libra the Balance must be somewhere between Spica and Antares, I suppose. The two stars together in the equator, just north of Scorpio, are in the old man Ophiuchus, who is south of Hercules. There is a serpent on each side of him. What nice company! Yes, with the club of Hercules shaking over his head, and Poniatowski’s Bull ready to toss his shoulder. But he has the shield of the Polish hero Sobieski behind him, which hangs, too, over the head of Sagittarius. How shall I find Aquarius? He has his foot on Fomalhaut, he leans back on Capricornus, and has Pisces, the Fishes, on the other side. What is the great star north of Capricornus? That is Altair, in Aquila the Eagle, whose wings are spread over the equator. Aquila is between Ophiuchus and Aquarius. As we have got over Aquarius, and come to Pisces, which are over Cetus the Whale, I suppose we are at Aries again. We are. But I should like you to know that Pegasus, the Flying Horse, is over Aquarius, and that the Swan and Lyre are between that and Hercules, and north of the Eagle. Taking a line from the south pole through the Whale’s tail, we have a bright star in the back of Pegasus, called Algenib, not far from the junction of the equator and ecliptic in Pisces. The star beyond Algenib, further north, is larger, though. Alpherat is its name, and it is one of the eyes of Andromeda, the lady with the chains on her hands. O, I know all about that story, father. The ancients said she was fastened to a rock in the sea, and a monster was gnawing at her. But a warrior, called Perseus, came with his sword and delivered her. Then, as you have Andromeda’s eye, you can fancy the Zodiacal Fish biting her, and Perseus with his sword to the left. There is a triangle between Aries and Andromeda. What a dazzling star that is, forming the north corner of a triangle with Aldebaran and the Twins. Yes, Capella, or the Little Kid, in the arms of Auriga, is certainly very fine. Auriga’s foot is on the Bull’s head. Half-way from Alpherat of Andromeda to Capella, is Medusa’s Head, just over the Pleiades. We have gone round, I think, father, but I do wish I could see the old Bear again. You have only to imagine yourself following out a line from the Belt through Castor and Pollux. Yes, but I should have to dive down into the ocean to reach his claws.” DOUBLE STARS. “That wonderful tell-tale, the ‘telescope,’ reveals the double character of some stars,” said Mr. Marple. “There are six thousand stars which are thus double. That is singular. There are some in the Pleiades, in the Dog, in Orion, and in the Southern Cross and Crown. But the most wonderful part of my story is yet to come. Some of these double stars revolve round each other. What! Great suns at a tremendous distance from one another, walk round one another? Why, if they have planets round them, like our sun has, these must have a fine double journey to make. How many of these strange stars are there? About 650 of them are Binary or revolving. But which stands still to have the other revolving round it? They both move, each one round the other. A regular polka in the heavens, father. And yet I suppose they are not just like a gentleman and his lady partner. I don’t know that; for it has been observed that a number have different colours to their companions. While one is blue, the other will be yellow. One shall be green, and its mate will be orange. One-half are white, and one-tenth are both blue. That does please me. How I should like to be in a planet where my sun should be blue, and its companion sun red. It would be so funny to get up in the morning and see my sun blue, throwing a blue tint on everything. Then, when the other sun rose, a rich red would steal over the blue, and change everything. But when the blue sun had set, the red one would have it all its own way, and bathe my world in its ruddy light. That fancy is good, and not very improbable either; especially if the other sun should come pretty near your sun at times, as it is likely they move in an ellipse. Can you tell me, dear father, how long these pleasant binary stars take in performing their polka? One in Hercules takes thirty-one years. In our old Great Bear, a binary pair take sixty-one, and in Leo eighty-two. In the Swan we have 178 years, and in the Virgin 182. In the Crown we have two several times given of 608 and 736 years. It is believed that one pair are 1200 years. The North Polar Star is double, and is thought by some to revolve in 6000 years. Please, father, tell me some more about the colours of the double folk. The Polar double stars are red and white. In Scorpion, there is a white one and a lilac one; in the Centaur, we have both orange; in Andromeda, crimson and green; in the Lion, gold and green; in one of Scorpio, White and plum; in Castor, yellow and green; in Antares, both are bright red; Arcturus was all red in 1841, and yellow in 1852. I wonder how far these partners are from each other. That is difficult to ascertain. The binary stars of the Swan are thought to take 450 years going their circuit, and yet to be billions of miles away from each other. There is little danger of quarrelling at that distance apart, father. Astronomers talk of stars running against one another. There are also triple stars. Three stars polkaing in and around each other! That is odd. Where are there any? In the Lyre and Scorpion. In the latter the colours are white, grey, and yellow. In the Swan the largest star is very yellow, and its two mates are blue. But more wonderful still, in Orion there are four stars thus rolling round each other.” PERIODICAL AND VARIABLE STARS. It was upon a lovely evening, when off the coast of South America, ready to slip across by the side-help of the South-east Trades to the Cape of Good Hope, that Mr. Marple found his son at his old post. “Now then,” said he, “my star-gazing boy, are you quite sure that none of them have run away since last night? I am not sure of that, father; for ever since you proved that the Fixed stars were not fixed, I think I might some day find a bright friend gone on a visit to another universe somewhere; perhaps, getting into such agreeable society as to have no wish to come back again to our visible universe; or, maybe, to pop back again in his place. It so happens, James, that what you have imagined, really takes place. Some stars do really disappear, to return, or not; and others, wholly strangers to us, come within observation. That is the queerest thing you have told me yet. What droll grain and fruit. The Lord looked upon the hearts of Cain and Abel, and he saw true worship in Abel’s heart, but in the heart of Cain he saw selfishness and sin. So he did not accept his offering. Then the sin in Cain’s heart rose into his tongue as he talked angrily with his brother, and by and by it crept out into his hand, and he struck his brother and killed him. The seed of murder, which is hate, had sprung up quickly in Cain’s heart. [Illustration: The Two Altars. ] HIS WORK. One time a man came to one of the men who worked for him, gave him a big stone, and said, “Now cut in this stone leaves just like the ones in this picture.” The stone did not look very pretty, and the man said, “I will do just the very best I can, but I wish I could cut in this beautiful marble here.” So he toiled away with his sharp tools, and, after much work, he finished the leaves according to the pattern. When he finished this the master brought him another just like it, and told him to cut a branch in it. So for weeks he worked on these big, rough stones, and he did not know what they were for. One day, when he was walking down town in the large city, he saw a beautiful building. He went over to look at it, and there, in front of that large building, were all those big, rough stones upon which he had been working for so long; but they were all put together now to form a most beautiful picture. The man looked at it a long time and then said: “O how glad I am I did it well! Now I see what the master meant.” FORGIVE THE WRONG. Dear child, has some one done you ill? Don’t hasten to resent it; Oft those who seek a swift revenge Find leisure to repent it. Though anger loud for vengeance cries, Again, again deny it; Two wrongs will never make one right, Howe’er you multiply it. [Illustration] THE STORYBOOK. “I have a little storybook; I love to read it too; It tells about the fairy folk, And what they say and do, “And how they sleep in lily bells And scare away the bees, And visit birdies in their nest, And do just what they please.” [Illustration] “WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR?” Said a little girl: “It is easy enough to remember that the old woman who lives down in the Row is my neighbor, for she is very poor and lives in a poor house, and when I carry her things mamma sends she says, ‘Bless you, my little lady;’ but it isn’t so easy to remember that my own grandma is my neighbor when she wants me to run up stairs after her spectacles, or hold some yarn for her just when I’m playing.” [Illustration: The Man with the Gridiron Collar. ] [Illustration: Five O’clock Tea. ] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES 1.

THE SECRET MEETING. Two days after the holidays began, the four younger members of the Danvers family received a note summoning them to a secret meeting at half-past seven the next morning in the summer-house. Drusie, who had written and delivered the notes, including one to herself, was the first to reach the appointed place; and when, a few minutes later, the other three arrived, they found her seated at the rustic table with a sheet of paper and a pencil before her, and a glass of water at her elbow. "Good-morning," she said, rising and shaking hands with them all round. "Helen, will you sit facing me, and Jim and Tommy at either side?" In a solemn silence they obeyed; and then seating herself again, she took a sip of water. Not that she was thirsty, but she was rather nervous. It was so long since the last meeting, and hitherto Hal had always been the chairman. She stifled a sigh; it seemed so strange to hold a secret meeting without him. "Go ahead," said Jim, encouragingly; "or would you like me to be chairman, Drusie?" "Certainly not," she replied hastily. "I am the eldest here, and of course I must be chairman. And you must be serious, Jim, for we have got a lot to talk about this morning, and it won't do for Hal to come out and find us here." "He is asleep and snoring," said Helen, in a tone of great contempt. "He has learned a lot of silly things at school, and one of them is never to get up until he is called." "Order, please," said Drusie, rapping on the table. "You must not begin to discuss the subject until I have announced it." She rose, gulped down a few mouthfuls of water, and said: "Ladies and gentlemen, we are met here this morning to discuss a question of paramount importance." She paused, partly for breath and partly to take note of the effect of her words. She was proud of that beginning, which she had learned from the report of a missionary meeting. She was pleased to observe that Helen and Tommy looked decidedly impressed, but Jim was grinning. Frowning at him, she resumed: "I may say that the matter affects us all very seriously, and it is one that ought to be taken up by the nation at large. But I regret to say that the people of England are only too apt to shirk their very obvious, their very obvious--" But at that point she stuck hopelessly fast. Though she had carefully avoided glancing at Jim, she had seen his face out of the corner of one eye, and the wide, fixed grin that ornamented it had put her out dreadfully. "Oh, come," he said, striking in; "aren't you laying it on rather thick? Even though Hal has come back from school with so much side on that he does not know what to do with himself, I don't see that the nation at large is concerned." "No, of course not," Drusie acknowledged; "but it said that in the paper, you know, and it seemed a nice beginning." "Well, suppose we skip that part," said Jim, "and get to the real business, which is of course about Hal." "Very well," said Drusie, though she rather regretted her long sentences. "I called this meeting to talk about Hal," she said, "and to ask what you all thought about the birthday. You know we have been busy making the ammunition to storm the fort with; but if he doesn't want to defend it, it won't be much good preparing any more cannon balls. Of course, one of us could defend it; but a fight without Hal wouldn't be any fun at all. At least, that is what I think; but what do you say?" This time Drusie had been heard with as much attention as she could wish for. The matter really was a very serious one. In two days' time it would be the twins'--Hal and Drusie's--birthday; and ever since they had been big enough to throw straight, they had always celebrated this double birthday with a big battle, followed by a feast in the summer-house. Hal had always defended the fort, while Drusie led the attacking party; and this year they had expected to have a really splendid fight, for during the past fortnight they had spent all their spare time in making ammunition, and the supply of cannon balls was larger than ever before. But if Hal was not going to take part in the fight, all these preparations would be thrown away. It was really very difficult to know what he would or would not do, for he was so altered by his one term at school that he hardly seemed like the same boy. He did not tease or bully them, but he simply took as little notice as possible, and spoke to them in a lofty, superior sort of way, as though he were a very grown-up person and they very little children. Sometimes, however, he quite forgot to be dignified and condescending, and then Drusie hoped he meant to take part in the birthday fight as usual. And the awkward part of it was that Drusie could not ask him his intentions, as it was against their rules to say one word to him about the fight until the very day on which it was to take place. "I suppose," said Helen, with a scornful little sniff, "he has grown too grand to fight. He would call it baby-play." "What about the feast?" asked Jim. "Weren't you going to say something about that too, Drusie?" "Oh yes," she said; and after she had drunk a little more water she rose to her feet again. The chairman was always supposed to finish the glass of water, and that was a part of her duties that Drusie did not much relish when the meeting was held before breakfast. Under pretence of moving it out of her way, Jim drew the tumbler towards him, and when she was not looking he filled it up from a jug which he had hidden under the table the evening before. "The feast," she said earnestly, "is going to be a specially nice one. I am making all the wine myself, and I taste it ever so many times a day to see if it is still good. I won't tell you everything that is in it; but you can guess how lovely it will be when I say that it was made from apples, and pears, and prune juice, and sugar, and some tea that I saved from breakfast. There are lots of other things in it, too," she said, interrupting herself; "but that is a secret. The best of my wine is that it hasn't cost anything, and so we shall have more money to spend on other things. It is pocket-money day to-day, and it must all go towards the feast. My sixpence and yours, Jim, and Helen's and Tommy's threepences make one and sixpence. That is a lot of money, and I am sure Hal will give us his shilling." "I don't think he will," said Jim, biting his lips to keep from laughing as he saw Drusie look down with mingled surprise and dismay at her nearly full glass; "he is hard up. He borrowed a penny half-penny from me the other day, and hasn't paid it back yet; and he told me that he had got rather a big bill in the village." "Well," Drusie continued, after she had bravely gulped down some more water, "it doesn't matter very much if he doesn't give anything. We have plenty. And now we must vote." Tearing the sheet of paper into four pieces, she passed them round the table. "If you want to go on preparing for the fight and the feast, you must each write 'yes;' if you don't want to go on, you must write 'no.'" Then she sat down, feeling rather proud of the clear way in which she had spoken, and made another attempt to finish her glass of water. Without the slightest hesitation Jim scribbled the word "yes" on his piece of paper, and when Tommy saw what Jim had written he put "yes," too. Helen took longer to make up her mind. She could not help thinking that if they went on with the preparations for the fight, and Hal refused to have anything to do with it, they would look very silly. For at the bottom of her heart Helen was rather impressed by the airs that Hal gave himself, and would have liked very much to imitate them. But knowing well that the other three would vote for going on with the fight, she, too, wrote "yes," and put her folded slip with the others into the hat which Jim passed round. The chairman opened them hastily. "They are all 'yeses,' so we must go on with the preparations just the same," she said, rising once more to address the meeting; "and if Hal gives us his shilling after breakfast, it will mean that he is going to defend the fort. That is all, I think. I now declare this meeting ended." "Hear, hear!" said Jim. "But you must finish your water, Drusie. We shan't think anything of you as a chairman if you leave a drop." "I keep on drinking all the time," said poor Drusie, giving her tumbler, still nearly full, a glance of strong distaste. "Perhaps you only sip it," said Jim gravely. "Shut your eyes, and take big mouthfuls. You _must_ finish it, you know." The sense of duty was strong in Drusie, and so she shut her eyes and made one more heroic effort. The instant her eyes were closed, Jim filled up her glass as she drank. He had hoped to make her finish the entire jugful, but he shook so with suppressed laughter that instead of pouring it into her glass he poured it on to her nose. "O Jim!" she said reproachfully, as the truth burst upon her; "how much have I drunk?" "Four tumblers full," he said triumphantly. "You make a splendid chairman, Drusie." She couldn't help laughing, too, when she saw the nearly empty jug. She dried her face, scolded Jim, and then forgave him in the same breath, for a sweeter-tempered child than Drusie never lived. After that the meeting broke up, and a few minutes later the bell rang for breakfast. Hal was already seated at the table when they reached the nursery. He was a nice-looking boy, taller than Drusie by a couple of inches, and well grown for his years, which would be twelve on the following Tuesday. "Hallo!" he said, as they all trooped in; "what have you been up to? I know," he said, catching sight of the tumbler now really empty at last in Drusie's hand. "A secret meeting. You might have asked me. What was it about?" [Illustration: Hal at table] Drusie flushed up and looked guilty. She could not tell him that the meeting had been about himself. But just then Helen interposed. "Why, you wouldn't have cared to come," she said. "You said yesterday that secret meetings were baby things." So he had, but it nevertheless was a pity that Helen reminded him of it just then. He had come down to breakfast that morning inclined to drop back into his old place among them, and his tone and manner were friendly and pleasant. But Helen's speech rubbed him up the wrong way at once, and in an instant he became the lofty and contemptuous school-boy brother again. "And so they are baby things, Miss Helen," he said; "but it is rather amusing, you know, to watch babies at play. That is why I should have liked to be told of this important secret meeting in time." That that was not the reason Drusie knew as well as he did. And he felt rather ashamed when he saw the hurt expression that came to her face. But Helen really must be taught that there was a great difference between a little girl of eight who had never been away from home in her life and a boy of twelve who had been to school. But it was not always easy to snub Helen. "You are silly, Hal," she said. "Just because you have been to school for one term, you fancy that you are too big to play with us. Such nonsense." Well, of course, that led to a sharp answer from Hal. Helen replied again, and a hot wrangle went on across the breakfast table. "Come, come, Master Hal," said nurse at last--for though Helen had certainly begun this quarrel, it was generally Hal who had done so since he came home--"what would your father and mother say if they were at home and heard you? They would not think that you had been very kind to your brothers and sisters since you came back." "I wish they were at home," said Hal, suddenly flaming out, "and then I should have my meals with them, instead of being shut up with all of you. I hate having my meals in the nursery. I am not a little boy any longer, and I don't see why I should." There was a moment's dead silence after this outburst, and all the others gazed wonderingly at Hal. They were astonished that he should have dared to speak in that rebellious tone to nurse. She, however, looked neither surprised nor angry. "Very well, Master Hal," she said; "if that is all your grievance, it is easily put to rights. You shall have your meals in the schoolroom, if you like. I can't let you have them in the dining-room, because it would make extra work, and the parlour-maid is away. But Ann can easily carry in what I send you from here." [Illustration: Tommy] That was not at all what Hal wanted. He was too proud, however, and also far too sulky, to say any more on the subject. He was glad when nurse rose and said grace, and he was at liberty to leave the nursery. "One minute, Master Hal," she said, as he was hurrying to the door; "have you forgotten that this is Saturday and pocket-money day? Wait while I get out my purse and pay you all." Drusie watched him anxiously. Would he remember the birthday feast, and hand her the shilling, or would he keep it himself? Alas! Jim had been right, and she wrong. He received the shilling with a muttered word of thanks, and slipping it into his pocket left the room. "I wonder," said Tommy, in an awestruck, thoughtful voice, "what Hal will do with a _whole_ shilling? Will he spend it all at once, do you think?" [Illustration: Chapter I tailpiece] [Illustration: Chapter II headpiece] CHAPTER II. A FRIEND IN NEED. Though Hal's crossness at breakfast had made Drusie feel rather sad, it was impossible for her to unhappy for long on such a beautiful morning; and when Helen suggested that they should take a few of the rabbits with them to the clover field she cheerfully agreed. "Punch and Judy and Toby went with us last time," she said, "and they didn't behave very well, so we won't take them with us to-day. Let's take Jumbo." Jumbo was the oldest of all the rabbits, and he belonged to Hal, which was perhaps the reason that Drusie wished to take him. She thought it would please Hal. Partly because Jumbo was so old, and partly because he was also very bad tempered, he lived by himself in a comfortable, roomy hutch, with a soft bed of hay at one end and a great wide space at the other, in which he took his meals and looked out of the door at the other rabbits. Helen, who did not care very much for Jumbo, declared that he did that on purpose to aggravate them, for they all finished their food long before he was half-way through his, and then they had nothing else to do but to sit and watch him. And that made them feel hungry again. He was sitting before his door now munching bran and oats, and at the mention of his name he pricked up his long ears and sleepily blinked his eyes. "H'm," said Helen, looking at him rather distrustfully; "Jumbo too can be dreadfully naughty when he likes, and he rather looks as if he meant it to-day." But that, Drusie said laughing, was all nonsense, for no rabbit could have looked meeker or better-behaved than Jumbo that morning. So it was decided that he should accompany them; and as Punch and Judy and Toby scratched at their doors when they saw him on the ground, Jim said it would be unkind not to take them as well. And Drusie declined to leave Salt and Pepper behind, for they were always good. Thus, when the four children started for the clover field, it was a very big party of rabbits that went with them. But as Jumbo followed a great deal better than many dogs do, and as all the other rabbits followed Jumbo, the children had no trouble at all with them. The way to the clover field lay through their own garden, and then across a big, sunny meadow. By the time they reached the meadow it was growing very hot, and the children sauntered along under the shade of a high hedge, and talked about the fight to be held on the following Tuesday. Drusie felt more hopeful than she had done before breakfast, and she was perfectly sure that Hal would defend the fort. She was full of plans for making the fight a better and more exciting one than any they had yet had, and she was suggesting a scheme by which Tommy could act both as scout and advanced outpost, when a strong, delicious scent from the clover field was wafted towards them on the soft summer, breeze. Jumbo smelt it, and lifting up his black nose gave one or two sniffs, and then darting past them at a rate surprising in a rabbit of his age made straight for the gap in the hedge; and, of course, after that there was no more time for conversation, for where Jumbo went the other rabbits followed. It was quite as much as the children could do to keep them in sight, and when they scrambled through the gap five of the six rabbits were sitting in a row contentedly munching away at the juicy stalks and cool green leaves of the clover. But Jumbo would not condescend to eat anything but pink, honey-filled flowers, and going from plant to plant he sat up on his hind legs and bit off the stalk just below the head. "Jumbo _is_ a clever rabbit," said Helen admiringly; "the others don't know the difference between the flowers and the leaves." Then suddenly they all burst out laughing. For Jumbo, getting tired perhaps of sitting up so much on his hind legs, tried to support himself against a stalk while he nibbled at the flowers. But the stalk gave way, and Jumbo fell heavily across Pepper's neck, who, indignant at such a liberty, gave a squeak and darted away. Jumbo, trying hard to look as though he had tumbled down on purpose, began to wash his face and ears in a very diligent manner. [Illustration: "_Jumbo began to wash his face and ears_"] It was some time before the children thought of returning; but presently Jim, who never cared to sit still for very long, said that they might as well be going, and added that as the rabbits had been so good they would give them an extra ramble, and take them home by the lane that ran along the top of the hill. But that, as Helen remarked, was saying one word for the rabbits and two for himself; for the lane bordered the land belonging to an old gentleman, named Grey, who had lately come to live there, and from a gate at the top of the hill a glimpse could be caught of the river, where, too, a lovely pair of swans might be seen. Jim took a great interest in these swans, and longed to get down to the water so as to be close to them. But the gamekeeper was a surly fellow, and if he saw the children lingering near he would tell them that his master "couldn't abear boys nor girls either," and always was most severe if any people were caught trespassing on his land. Thus Jim had never dared to climb the gate. But Jumbo this morning was to give him an excuse for so doing. When they reached it, the children paused to gaze down at the river, which there broadened out into a sort of lake, with a grassy islet in the centre. The six rabbits paused also. The clover they had eaten had made them feel rather sleepy, but now they were beginning to recover from the effects of it, and now they suddenly became quite frisky. Punch leaped over Judy's back, and then chased her into the middle of the road and back again. Even old Jumbo caught the infection, and though he very seldom condescended to take any notice of the other rabbits, now he gave Toby a playful poke with his nose, following it up by a bite on his ear that was not quite so playful. Toby gave a loud squeak of pain, and Jumbo, afraid perhaps that he might receive a bite in return, jumped through the bars and scampered down the field. He was half-way to the river before the children recovered from their surprise, and shouted to him to come back. But the more they shouted the faster he ran. And that was not the worst either, for the other rabbits were after him in a twinkling. But quick as they were Jim was quicker. He had no intention of allowing such an excellent opportunity of exploring the forbidden ground to slip, and crying that it was of no use to call to Jumbo he scrambled over the gate and rushed helter-skelter down the field, taking great care, however, not to get in front of Jumbo, but running behind him shouting and waving his hands. [Illustration: Jim climbing gate] To the interested onlookers at the gate, whom an uneasy fear of the gamekeeper kept from entering the field, it really seemed much more as though Jim were chasing Jumbo down the field than trying to capture him. But, perhaps, even if Jim had wished to catch Jumbo he could not have done so, for the old rabbit was thoroughly enjoying his scamper, and with his little, short tail cocked up and his long ears streaming behind him he raced along like the wind. And then a dreadful thing happened. Some twenty feet from the river the ground sloped very steeply, and such was the rate at which Jumbo was going that, when he reached this part, he could not stop himself, but tumbled head over heels, and rolling down the bank disappeared with a big, loud splash into the water. Jim uttered a shout of dismay, which was echoed by all the others, who, hastily climbing over the gate, came rushing pell-mell down the field. "Oh, where is he? Oh, is poor darling Jumbo drowned?" Drusie gasped. But he was not drowned. Even as Drusie spoke his soft, black nose came to the surface, and kicking vigorously he struck out for the opposite bank. "Why, he can swim!" Drusie cried joyfully. "But don't go that way, Jumbo; come here. Jumbo! Jumbo!" [Illustration: Drusie kneeling on bank of stream] Kneeling down on the bank she called to him; but Jumbo had quite lost his presence of mind, and, far too bewildered and alarmed to heed the children's cries, he paddled away from them as fast as ever he could. "Oh, what shall we do?" Drusie cried in great distress. "His long fur will soon get so heavy that he will not be able to keep himself up. O Jumbo darling, come here!" Jim was quite as frightened as she was. If only he had known how to swim, he would have plunged in to the rescue at once. Then, as if matters were not already bad enough, they suddenly became worse. The swans, which Jim had been so anxious to see, suddenly sailed majestically round the bend of the small island, and came towards the children, expecting crumbs. [Illustration: swans] But none of the children, not even Jim, had any attention to spare for them, beautiful though they were. Their eyes were fixed on Jumbo, whose breath was coming in quick, short pants, and whose poor, short, little legs were growing more and more tired. Disappointed at not getting the crumbs, the swans slowly turned round and were sailing away again when they caught sight of Jumbo, and with angry hisses and long necks outstretched they bore down upon him as he swam about half-way between the island and the bank. "Oh, go to the island; it is nearer!" Drusie shrieked; "and O Jumbo, make haste!" It almost seemed as if Jumbo understood what she said. At any rate he began to swim towards the island as fast as ever he could. But weighted with his long fur, and unaccustomed to swimming--for he had never in his life before been in the water, and how he had learned to swim always remained a mystery to the children--he yet struck out valiantly. He knew that he was swimming for his very life, and he never ceased paddling for one moment. The children watched the race in a state of frantic excitement, while Jim ran up and down the bank looking in vain for something to throw at the swans and drive them away. And now came a moment during which the children literally held their breath. Jumbo was within two or three yards of the island when the foremost of the two swans stooped its long neck and made a savage grab at his hind legs. It seemed impossible that the cruel beak could miss him, yet it did; for poor Jumbo was by that time so exhausted that he suddenly sank and disappeared. The angry, surprised swan dived his head down in search of him; but the current, which swept round here with some force, carried Jumbo away, and finally flung him, a bedraggled and most unhappy-looking rabbit, on to a corner of the island. Drusie always declared afterwards that Jumbo had dived and swum under water; but whether that was true or not, saved he certainly was. Luckily for him the swans did not follow him, but contented themselves with sailing majestically up and down between the island and the bank, ready, if he showed the least sign of taking to the water again, to pursue him. But Jumbo had had enough of swimming to last him all his life, and preferred to stay where he was rather than venture again into the river. But what was to happen next? They could not go home and leave Jumbo on the island, and yet there seemed no way in which they could get at him. And at any moment the cross gamekeeper might appear, and at this thought Drusie glanced round uneasily. As she did so she gave a little jump, for running quickly towards them was somebody who, she was afraid at first, might be the gamekeeper himself. But a second glance showed her that the new-comer was only a boy, and a very nice-looking boy too, with merry, dark-blue eyes and a friendly manner. "Hallo!" he said, rather breathlessly. "Is anything the matter? I heard a lot of shouting, and I came to see if anybody had tumbled into the river. But you are all quite dry." "Yes, we are all right," Drusie explained hurriedly. "But one of our rabbits--Jumbo--has tumbled in, and the swans have chased him on to the island, and we don't know how to get him back again." She pointed as she spoke to the island, and the boy, following the direction of her glance, burst out laughing. "Is that a rabbit?" he said. "Why, it looks more like a drowned rat than anything else." "Jumbo is very handsome when he is dry," Drusie said, inclined at first to be a little offended. But his laughter was infectious, and Jumbo did after all look so very much like a drowned rat that she could not help laughing too. "I say, what a jolly lot of rabbits you have got!" the boy said, looking down at the other five, who were busy nibbling away at the grass, without seeming to care in the least what happened to Jumbo; "but aren't you afraid of their running away?" "They generally behave beautifully," Drusie said, who, because the other three were rather shy, was obliged to do all the talking herself; "but something must have startled Jumbo when we were at the top of the hill, for he set off at a tremendous scamper, and tumbled in headforemost before we knew what was happening to him." "Poor old Jumbo!" said the boy, as he looked across at the shivering, melancholy rabbit. "We must rescue him though, and that is easily done." As he spoke he led the way along the bank to a spot where a thick clump of willows grew; and moored to one of these trees was a small, light canoe. "I'll paddle across in less than no time," he said, "and if the swans do not interfere, I'll soon bring him safely back to you." The swans did not interfere, however, and Jumbo a minute or two later was clasped in Drusie's arms. She almost cried over him in her joy at his safety. Sitting down on the bank she began to dry him with her handkerchief; but it was soaked through at once, and the boy suggested that they should rub him with their hands. So Drusie placed him tenderly on the grass, and they rubbed him until their arms ached; and no doubt Jumbo ached too, for they all rubbed with a will. "But at any rate," Drusie said in a tone of satisfaction, "he won't catch cold now, and he is so old that he might have had a dreadful attack of rheumatism." Long before Jumbo was dry they had all become very friendly with their new acquaintance. Jim and Helen and Tommy forgot to be shy, and they all chatted away together as if they had known each other for quite a long time. It was not until half an hour later, as, with Jumbo lying comfortably in Drusie's arms, for she said he was too weak to walk, they were all hurrying home, that they remembered they did not even know what their new friend's name was, or where he lived. "Perhaps," said Helen, "he lives at the Grange, and Captain Grey is his father." [Illustration: gamekeeper] "Captain Grey hasn't any children," Drusie said. "I heard nurse say so." "Then perhaps he is staying there on a visit," Jim said. But Drusie did not think that that was likely either, for had not the gamekeeper said that his master "could not abear boys"? And if that was the case, he certainly would not have one staying in the house. But whoever he was, they all four agreed that he was an exceedingly nice boy, and they hoped that they might meet him again. [Illustration: Chapter II tailpiece] [Illustration: Chapter III headpiece] CHAPTER III. HAL FINDS A FRIEND. On their way through the garden they met Hal. Directly they saw him his brothers and sisters rushed up and told him all about Jumbo's adventures, and about the boy who had been so kind to them. Hal was not greatly interested. He was looking pale and listless, and there were heavy, dark lines about his eyes. When they asked him eagerly if he knew who the boy could be, he shook his head and yawned, and said that he was sure he did not know. "Come and have a game of cricket," he said, rousing himself a little. "I have got my bat here, and the ball is somewhere about. Just have a look for it, Tommy. We won't bother about stumps. This tree will do quite well for the wicket." "All right," Drusie said, delighted to find that Hal was willing to be friends again. "I should love a game; but we must put Jumbo and the other rabbits away first.--Come along, Jim and Helen." She and Jim ran off at once, but Helen followed more slowly. She had a shrewd suspicion that Hal merely wanted them to bowl and field for him, and that he did not intend to allow them to bat. And she did not see the fun of running about in the hot sun after his balls, if she was not going to have any of the batting. But Drusie and Jim were too excited at the prospect of a game to listen to her words of warning, and as soon as the rabbits had been hastily bundled into their hutches they raced back to the tree where Hal was waiting for them. "You shall bowl first, Jim," he said.--"Drusie, you can stand behind the tree and be wicket-keeper, for, unless Jim has improved wonderfully since I went away, most of his balls will be fearful wides.--Helen, you go over there, and mind to throw the balls up sharp." "Then you are going in first," said Helen, "and we are not going to toss?" But Hal was busy measuring out the distance at which Jim was to stand, and did not hear her question. Or if he did, he evidently did not consider it worthy of an answer. "Now then," Hal said, coming back; "I am ready. I am not going to make any runs, you know, as it is too hot; but you others must send the ball up promptly, or else it makes it slow work for me." Jim's bowling was not very difficult to deal with, and Hal knocked the balls about pretty much as he pleased, and gave the fielders, and especially Helen, plenty of running about. "Well, at this rate," Drusie said merrily, as she cleverly stopped a ball that was a very bad "wide" indeed, "we shall never get you out." "No, I don't suppose you will," said Hal; and then he added ungratefully, "That is the worst of playing with a set of girls; one never gets any practice." Whether Jim was annoyed at being classed as a girl, and was therefore put on his mettle, cannot be said for certain, but at any rate his very next ball hit the tree fair and square, and with so much violence that a piece of the rough elm bark was knocked off. "Hurrah!" shouted Drusie, clapping her hands; "bowled at last. Who goes in next?" "Don't be in such a mighty hurry," said Hal, who was looking distinctly angry. "I am not out--not a bit of it. Why, that ball was not anything like in the middle of the tree. Who ever heard of a wicket a yard and a quarter wide? You'll have to bowl better than that, Jim, to get me out." "All right," Jim said, recovering himself. He had looked rather blank for a moment when Hal declared so emphatically that he was not out. "I suppose that ball was rather to one side of the tree. I will have another try." But Helen was not so easily satisfied. "You said, Hal, that the tree was to be the wicket; you never said anything about only counting the middle of the tree." "Did I say so?" he replied. "Well, I made a mistake. Of course, it would be rather absurd to count the whole tree. I tell you what I will do. I will hang my cap on this little twig here, and if the ball hits that I am out. Now, are you satisfied?" They all, with the exception of Helen, hastened to say that they were, and the game went on. A few minutes later he sent an easy catch, and darting forward Helen caught the ball. "How about playing with girls now, Master Hal?" she cried. "I suppose you will own that you are fairly out this time?" But he did nothing of the sort. "Pooh!" he said contemptuously; "that was a pure fluke. Any one could have caught that; and so it does not count either. I am not going out." "Oh, I say," Jim said in a remonstrating tone, "is that the way you play at your school?" "Of course, it is not," said Hal. "Don't be a donkey, Jim. How often am I to tell you that this is not a regular game, but just a sort of knock up, you know?" "In which you get all the knocking up," Helen said indignantly. Hal laughed. "Now, don't get into a temper, Helen. I don't see what girls want to play cricket for. It is not a girls' game. All they are good for is just to field, and that sort of thing." At that Helen fairly choked with anger, Drusie opened her eyes very wide, and Jim lay down on the grass and laughed quietly to himself. Considering that both his sisters had been toiling on his behalf for the last half-hour, it certainly was very cool of Hal to make such a speech. [Illustration: Jim and Helen] "I knew how it would be," Helen exclaimed passionately, as soon as she could find her voice; "and I warned you two others, only you would not listen. I knew perfectly well that Hal was not going to let us go in, and I call it downright unfair, and I for one am not going to field for him any more.--And you say," she added, turning indignantly to Hal, "that girls can't play cricket. Well, they can. Father says himself that Drusie plays awfully well for a girl, and I suppose he ought to know." "For a girl," Hal said slightingly; "yes, that is just it." "Please don't quarrel," Drusie said quickly. "You may stay in if you like, Hal, and I will bowl for you.--Jump up, Jim, and go and be wicket-keeper." With a scornful sniff for what she considered to be great weakness on Drusie's part, Helen returned to her place, where, in spite of her declaration that she did not intend to play any more, she continued to field. For a girl Drusie did bowl remarkably well, and Hal would have been the first to own it, had he not perceived a sort of triumphant "told you so" expression on Helen's face, which annoyed him greatly, and made him withhold the praise which Drusie would have been so pleased to hear. She exerted herself to do her very best, and before many minutes had passed she clean bowled him. There could be no doubt about it this time, for the twig on which the cap had been hung was broken by the force of the ball, and the cap fell to the ground. "Hurrah!" Helen shrieked, dancing about and clapping her hands. "How about girls not being able to bowl now, Master Hal? I suppose you will own that you really are out this time?" [Illustration: "_I suppose you will own that you really are out this time?_"] Hal looked not only mortified but exceedingly angry into the bargain. "You are a precious set, I must say," he said, looking contemptuously at the excited capers which Helen was cutting. "One would think that you had done something awfully wonderful by the way in which you are going on. That is just like a girl. Let her do something which she thinks rather clever, and there is no end to her airs." This was really rather severe on Drusie, who had neither said nor done anything to justify Hal's scornful remarks. But he was too annoyed to be fair, and as a punishment for what he chose to call Drusie's bragging, he tucked his bat under his arm, and told them that he was not going to play with them any more. "You can brag by yourselves," he said, "of your wonderful cricket. I am not going to put up with you any longer. I am sick of you all. I must say it is awfully hard on a fellow to come home and find that not one of his brothers or sisters is worth playing with. A more conceited, disagreeable lot I never met with." A dismayed silence followed this abrupt departure. It was broken by a short, quick sigh from Drusie. "Oh dear, oh dear!" she said, looking after Hal as he marched off with as much dignity as he could. "I do wish that I had not bowled him. If I had guessed that it would make him so cross, I would have sent him easy, baby-balls." "And got told for your pains that you could not bowl," Helen said with much scorn. "I do wonder how you can be so silly, Drusie. I think it serves Hal quite right. But I told you how it would be. I knew we should not get our innings. You can't say that I did not warn you." "No, we certainly can't," Jim said with a chuckle. "You have had a sort of 'I told you so' expression on your face ever since we began to play. And you know, Helen, if you ask me, I think it is all your fault that Hal went off in such a huff. He simply couldn't stand your being so awfully delighted when Drusie bowled him." If Hal's sudden display of temper had struck dismay into the hearts of his brothers and sisters, it had not left him particularly happy either. Though he would not own it, even to himself, he had an uncomfortable feeling that it was he who was conceited and disagreeable. He was, however, full of excuses for himself, and when his conscience pricked him he answered impatiently that nobody could be expected to put up with the fearful airs that they had all been giving themselves. Then, looking round to see that he was not being followed, he made his way to a hiding-place he had discovered behind the summer-house, and proceeded to employ himself there after a fashion of which nurse would most strongly have disapproved. He remained until the dinner-bell rang, when he crept out with a pale face and with every bit of his appetite gone. He dined alone in the schoolroom, and nurse shook her head as his plates were carried back to the nursery, for he had scarcely touched anything that she had sent in to him. "I hope, Master Hal, you are not going to be ill," she said, as soon as dinner was over. "What has come to you? You have not eaten anything." "I am not hungry," Hal muttered, flushing under her scrutinizing gaze. "I have got rather a headache--that's all." "Well, don't run about much in the sun," nurse said, only half satisfied. "You are looking very pale. Put on your straw hat too; that little cap is of no use at all. And don't go eating any green apples or gooseberries. I expect you have been in the kitchen-garden this morning, and that is what is the matter with you." But it was neither green apples nor gooseberries which had given Hal the very uncomfortable sensations from which he was suffering. That, however, he did not explain to nurse; and feeling very wretched and unhappy he wandered out into the garden, and flung himself under a big, shady elm-tree. The others were nowhere in sight, and he felt injured that they should, even after his conduct of the morning, have left him to himself. "A nice, sociable set they are," he said moodily. "Oh dear, how I do wish that I had somebody sensible to play with!" But though he chose to grumble, he knew perfectly well that he was not just then in the humour to appreciate any society, however sensible, and pillowing his head upon his arm he dropped off to sleep. [Illustration: Hal asleep] Meanwhile, Drusie had planned a busy afternoon for herself and the others, for they intended to go to the fort and make ammunition for Tuesday. Few children had nicer grounds to play in than the Danvers children. The garden was very large, and besides the lawn and the winding walks among the shrubberies, which afforded such capital hiding-places when they played hide-and-seek, there was the large kitchen-garden as well. Beyond the kitchen-garden lay pleasant, sunny fields, at the foot of which flowed a small stream that farther down joined the river in which Jumbo had been so nearly drowned. On the other side of the stream lay a long slip of land which Mr. Danvers always spoke of as a waste piece of ground, and over which he sometimes threatened to send the plough. But partly because the ground was really too poor to be of much good, and partly because the children begged him to leave it alone, it had never yet been disturbed, and the Wilderness, as they had named it, remained theirs to all intents and purposes. That the Wilderness was a brambly place could not be denied. It had originally been a grove of nut trees, and though some of these still flourished and bore nuts that had not their equal for size and flavour in all the country-side, they had for the most part been strangled by blackberry bushes and briers, and smothered by masses of wild clematis. The fort stood in a corner of the Wilderness. Within a few yards of it on one side was the stream; on the other and at the back it was surrounded by densely-growing hawthorn bushes. But the front was open and exposed to attack, for a cleared space in which only a few scattered nut trees grew lay before it. This fort had once been a summer-house, but it had long since been disused, and would, no doubt, have fallen into decay, had not the children hit upon the idea of making it the scene of their pitched battles, and had so propped it up and strengthened it that it was impossible to take except by surprise. The door had been nailed up and so had the window, and entrance could only be effected by scrambling up on the flat roof, and dropping through a hole which had been made there for that purpose. Even that hole could be closed by a hatch in time of need, and the besieged could lie snugly inside and listen to the heavy firing without, secure in the knowledge that as long as he chose to remain there none of the besiegers could touch him. But then his flag would be in danger; and by their rules of warfare, if the flag were captured or shot down, the fort was held to have capitulated. For more than a week before Hal's return from school the others had been busy getting the ammunition ready; they had dug up a quantity of sand from the bed of the stream, which, when mixed with a little clay and moistened with water, represented cannon-balls. As, however, they had no cannon, these balls had to be thrown by hand; and as they scattered when they struck, they appeared more formidable than they really were. But still one had been known to bring down the flag, and so win the day for the besiegers. The fort was mainly defended with a catapult loaded with mud pellets, shot being strictly forbidden as too dangerous. To protect them the besiegers wore a kind of helmet, which, though it gave them a somewhat ludicrous appearance, saved them from many a nasty blow. These helmets were neither more nor less than fine wire-gauze dish-covers, which they tied across their faces and fastened at the back of their heads. But the holder of the fort had to rely chiefly upon capture to win a victory, and when his enemies approached too closely, a bold rush often resulted in one of them being made prisoner. But, of course, even a brief absence from the fort left the flag undefended, and there was always a chance that, while one of the attackers was being pursued, some of the others might steal up and succeed in going off with the flag. So it will be easily understood that courage and skill, combined with a spirit that was bold and yet not too rash, were required to hold the fort. And as none of them possessed these qualities to the same extent as Hal, it followed that none of them held the fort as well as he did, or made such a good fight of it. Superintended by Drusie, they all worked very busily at the ammunition, and as they kneaded cannon-balls and pellets they laid out a plan of attack for the following Tuesday. Jim was of the opinion that they never took enough advantage of the shelter afforded by the thick and almost impenetrable bushes that grew on one side of the fort, and he proposed that while two of them made an attack in the open air, he or Drusie should lie concealed, and if Hal could be drawn out in pursuit they might get a chance of slipping in during his absence. "He may have brought back some new dodges," said Drusie hopefully. "I wonder if he has ever played a game of this sort at school? Do you think he has, Jim?" Jim thought it was doubtful. "I believe they always play cricket in the summer term," he said. "But this will be a splendid change for him." "I hope it will," said Drusie, with a sigh. "But I am simply not going to think what we shall do if, after all our trouble, Hal turns up his nose at a fight on Tuesday." [Illustration: Hal running] At tea-time Hal did not put in an appearance at all. "He ought to be hungry," nurse said, "for he did not eat much dinner. I wonder where he can be?" Tea was over, and they had all gone out into the garden again for a last stroll before bed-time, when they saw him come running across the field, which was separated from the lawn by a sunk fence. Leaping this, he rushed towards them, looking brighter and happier than he had done since his return. "I say," he called out; "whom do you think I have met this afternoon? I have had such a splendid time; just guess." They shook their heads; they could form no guess at all. "Well, you will hardly believe it, but Dodds is down here. Dodds Major," he added, seeing that somehow his news did not produce as much effect as he had anticipated. "Who is Dodds Major?" Drusie asked. "Oh, how stupid you are!" Hal cried; "Why, I have told you about him in my letters lots of times. He is out and away the nicest fellow in our school. A big fellow, too, thirteen and a half, and simply splendid at cricket. He is leaving at Christmas, and going to the college." "Does he live down here?" said Drusie. "No; he is staying at the Grange with his uncle, Captain Grey. He is going to be here the whole holidays. Isn't it splendid for me?" "Why," said Drusie, with a sudden sinking of her heart, "will you be much with him?" "Rather," said Hal; "as much as ever he will have me. Of course," he added, with an important air, "he is jolly glad, too, to find another fellow down here. We are going fishing to-morrow in Captain Grey's trout stream. Dodds says that it is simply packed with fish. Won't that be jolly? I was playing cricket with him all this afternoon. He is going to play in a match that some friends of his uncle's are getting up next week, and he says that perhaps he can get me into it too. Won't that be jolly?" In short, Hal was brimming over with good spirits. When, soon afterwards, nurse called Helen and Tommy to come to bed, Hal invited Drusie and Jim to come and sit with him while he had his tea, in order that he might chatter to them of his doings that afternoon, and about what he intended to do in future. And, of course, Dodds's name figured largely in his conversation, and neither Drusie nor Jim could help feeling rather glum as they heard how completely they were to be left out in the cold. "It was a lucky chance meeting him," Hal rattled on. "After dinner I had a nap, and then I went for a stroll. I crossed over the river and went up the field that lies next to the Wilderness, and there, sitting on a gate, I saw Dodds. I can tell you I was surprised, and so was he. We talked for a bit, and then he asked me to come and play cricket. We had an awfully jolly afternoon, I can tell you," Hal added for the fiftieth time, at least. "I am jolly glad that he is here." "Will you ask him to come over here and play?" said Drusie. "It would be rather nice to have some cricket with him--wouldn't it, Jim?" Hal looked as though his ears had been deceiving him. "What?" he said. "Ask Dodds over here to play with all of you? Why, you must be out of your senses, Drusie. The idea of Dodds playing with a girl! I say, how he would laugh!--We might have you, though, sometimes, Jim; you would be useful for fielding. I will ask him to-morrow if he would mind." Jim, far from being overwhelmed at the possible honour in store for him, privately made up his mind to decline it with thanks when the time came. While Hal had been speaking, a sudden idea had occurred to Drusie, and her face lit up with eagerness and excitement. "O Hal," she exclaimed, "I believe that Dodds Major is our boy--the nice boy who rescued Jumbo, and who talked to us for such a long time." Hal laughed scornfully. "You don't know Dodds Major," he said. "He is not a bit like that. Why, I tell you that he hates girls, and wouldn't take any notice at all of any of you. Why, he is older even than I am." "So was this boy," said Drusie. "But, of course, if you say that Dodds Major is not nice, they cannot be the same." "I never said Dodds was not nice," Hal said impatiently. "I only said that he was not the sort of boy to play with girls. I expect that fellow you met this morning was an awful muff." [Illustration: Chapter IV headpiece] CHAPTER IV. DISAPPOINTED HOPES. For the next two or three days his family saw little of Hal. Morning, afternoon, and evening he was over at the Greys'. His meals he took in the schoolroom, and though nurse would have allowed him to come back to the nursery, if he had cared to do so, he very much preferred to have them in solitary state. He seemed to see nothing ridiculous in sitting there by himself; indeed, as breakfast and a little sup of milk, but felt very cold after eating, and her legs were cramped. But Lotty did not dare to stand up, the wind was so high. She simply stretched her numbed limbs, and this relieved her a little. The whole of that day, whenever the boat was on the crest of a high wave, she kept looking out. But nothing saw she until the red sun was nearly setting and turning the spray into frothy blood; then, oh joy! a steamer bearing right down towards her. Oh joy! and oh hope! but oh grief and collapse when it passed on its way and never saw the _Jenny Wren_! Then down went the angry sun, and, slowly to-night, came darkness on. But although the spray dashed inboard so much that she scarce could look to windward, the sky was clear and a thousand bright stars were shining. Later on there was the aurora borealis. Later still, and after eating a few nuts, the gipsy lass, still crouching in the old place, fell into a deep, sound sleep while saying her prayers. * * * * * 'But I tell you it is, sir. Just out yonder on the lee bow, sir; my night-glass never told me a fib yet.' 'Well, mate, if you like to keep away a bit and maybe save a life, as you suggest, you may do so; only, don't let her get stove on top of some floating wreckage.' 'The wind is nearly down, skipper, though the seas are a bit high.' 'Hard a-port!' 'Hard it is, sir!' 'Easy, steady as you go!' A short, sturdy sailor was this mate, a bearded man with a kindly eye, who had roughed it far away in the Greenland Ocean even from his boyhood, and the bark he was now on board of was the _Nor'lan' Star_ of Hull, on a voyage now to Archangel for timber. Few vessels dared so dangerous a voyage at this season; but those brave fellows who did managed to make a very good thing of it. There was a big lump of a boy standing by his side in the starlight. 'Take a look through that glass, Ben, my lad. [Illustration: Presently the black hull of the bark was looming within fifty yards over her. LASS. PAGE 129. ] Focus her to your own tune, and squint ahead. See anything?' 'Ay, that do I, mate. Summat dark but dippin', dippin' ahind the seas like.' 'I thought your young sight was better than mine. See anything else?' 'It is a small boat, sir, and she is moored to leeward of something floating. And oh, sir, I can see a figure for'ard. Now, now I see a hand raised!' Lotty's hand might have been raised in a dream, yet was she fast enough asleep. 'Ben, hustle aft with all your might and fetch me a Roman candle.' There was a bright dazzling light all around the little boat, and Lotty awoke with a start, very much bewildered to see stars, bright crimson, blue, and green, falling all about her in the sea. But she had sense enough to know it was a rocket of some kind, and quickly pulled herself together. A noise of voices shouting came down the wind, and she flashed her light over and over again to show the sailors of that huge, dark ship that someone was alive in the boat. Presently the black hull of the bark was looming within fifty yards over her, and she could see her masts waving back and fore among the glittering stars. She did not forget to thank God for the deliverance that was close at hand. She, too, had been praying until, childlike, she had fallen asleep in the middle of 'Our Father, who art.' The rough sailors carried her tenderly on deck and aft, and even the _Jenny Wren_ was hoisted. Then sails were filled, and northwards once more sailed the _Nor'lan' Star_. The skipper had his wife on board, and she hardly knew how kind to be to poor Lotty, who was soon sound asleep on the saloon sofa, all her cares forgotten for the time being. * * * * * The time in camp went wearily by--oh, so wearily!--day after day, a whole week, and there was no word or sign of Lotty. Antony got all the newspapers he could think of, and read them, inch by inch, handing them quietly to Biffins Lee to glance at after he had finished. As long as he found nothing about Lotty in the paper hope lived in his heart, but again and again, to keep it burning, he had to recall the words of Crona. He feared, somehow, to go back there again notwithstanding, lest she might have received some second revelation that would dash all that hope aside. Wallace followed him everywhere and slept in his caravan at night. But the dog seemed very nervous at times, and would start as if with fear when he heard the slightest unusual sound. Antony avoided Biffins as much as he possibly could, because the man appeared to have but one string on which he cared to harp--namely, the utter ruin to the Queerest Show that the loss of Lotty Lee was bound to entail. But one day a strange thing happened. Antony Blake was walking sadly enough by the seashore at some distance from the camp, and Wallace himself quietly followed. Suddenly the great dog gave a yap of impatience, and, looking about, the young man saw him rush seawards, and, with a howl of mingled joy and despair apparently, take the water with a splash. And to his horror Antony noticed that the dog was making for some sort of cloth or garment that was rising and falling on the waves a long distance out. His heart almost stood still, and there were beads of cold perspiration on his brow as the dog seized the fearful something and was seen making his way inshore with it. It must be, young Antony thought, poor Lotty's dead body. He placed his hand over his eyes and kept it there for quite a long time, until he heard the dog bark again close beside him on the beach. What he had brought in was the mast and sail of the _Jenny Wren_. And Antony could breathe more freely now. But that night he made his way again to Crona's cottage, and, strangely enough, the old lady was waiting to receive him. CHAPTER XIII. ON BOARD THE 'NOR'LAN' STAR.' The little gipsy lass was in a very pleasant dream--at least she firmly believed it was a dream. Her dreams were nearly always nice, so much so indeed that she never cared to waken too soon out of one. She did not mean to, out of this one, for she was very warm and comfortable, and she would be aroused far too speedily presently, and find herself in the little caravan with hardly time for breakfast before Biffins Lee would be shouting for all hands to come to rehearsal. Yet she could not help wondering what o'clock it might be, so she just opened her eyes wide enough to look lazily through the lashes at the wee clock that ticked up in the skylight. Lo! the clock was not there. That was a skylight sure enough, but not Lotty's, and--why, surely it was moving, and everything else seemed moving, even her bed and her body. What a droll dream to be sure! Then the sound of voices close beside her, and the music of knives and forks and plates fell upon her ears, and the whole appeared to be very real. What could have happened? Where could she be? She remembered nothing. 'Wasn't it a blessing, mate, that you discovered that bit of a boat?' 'It was a 'tarposition of Providence, and that's what I calls it. God is ever kind, and those that has got to live He will bring again up out of the depths of the yawning deep itself.' 'That's so, mate; that's so.--How sweet and pretty the child looks asleep there. I declare, wife, I would like to go and kiss her.' 'Then why don't you, dear?' 'Well, Maggie, at present my mouth's about half-full of kippered herring, and it seems to me that kippered herring and kisses are not on the same quarterdeck like.' Lotty was beginning to think this surely could not be a dream, so she opened her eyes a very little way again and looked round her. She appeared to be inside a large German concertina, for this saloon was perfectly octagonal, but very cosily curtained and pretty, with plenty of pictures and photographs on the bulkheads. At the round table in the centre were seated four red people all looking her way--a rosy, motherly-like lady; a red-faced, good-natured-looking sumph of a lad, somewhat like Chops, but not so fat; a redder-faced, brown-bearded figure, jolly-looking, and dressed in blue pilot; and another man dressed similarly, the jolliest-looking and reddest of all--painted red by the sea every one of them, and by the spray of salt waves and the wild winds that had brushed their cheeks for many a long year. Perhaps the skipper's wife had seen the flickering of the child's eyes, for she got up now and knelt down beside the sofa, taking Lotty's hand. 'Are you better, darling? You've had such a nice sleep.' The bonny blue eyes were wide enough open now. 'It isn't a dream then?' 'No dream, little un,' said the skipper across the table. 'You are saved.' 'Oh, I don't like Salvation Army people,' cried Lotty; 'the band is vile. But this can't be heaven surely?' 'A long way off that port, my pretty. But you are saved, all the same, from a watery grave.' 'It were a 'tarposition of Providence, it were,' said the first mate. 'Hadn't been for the boy Ben, here, who is doin' dooty as second-mate, I wouldn't have seen Miss Mite. It's 'im ye've got to thank, little missie--nobut Ben.' 'And God,' said the skipper reverently. 'And God,' assented the mate. 'I remember all now,' said the gipsy lass, 'and I am very thankful; but they will all be so sad on shore, Chops and Mary and all. You couldn't land me, could you?' 'Ay, little dear,' laughed the skipper, 'we'll land ye; but it will be in Trondhjem. But we've made up our minds to make ye as happy as Arctic summer days are long.' Having once comforted herself with the thought that, although Antony and Chops and all the rest would mourn for her for a time as dead, there would be such a joyful meeting to make up for all when she got back again, she settled herself to be happy and to enjoy her strange, new life. When the captain and the mate and the boy Ben went on deck, the motherly lady dressed her and tidied her hair as much as it ever would tidy--for it was, like Lotty herself, very irrepressible--she sat down to breakfast. Lotty was not shy, no well-brought-up child of the world ever is. She could not even be timid beside so kindly a soul as the skipper's wife. No, she did not care for fish. 'It was nearly all fish in the camp,' she told Mrs Skipper Paterson; but the English bacon was a treat, and the English toast, and, 'Oh those eggs, how beautiful! What are they?' 'Sea-gulls', dear, from the rocks of Tromsö.' 'How large and pointed they are, and so sweetly green; and what are those curious streaks of black and brown, like a baby's writing, all over them?' 'Well,' said Mrs Skipper, who was just a little romantic, as all true sailors are, 'well, Lotty, I think that every egg is a love-letter written by a gull to her charming mate.' 'It seems such a pity to break them though.' 'So I have often thought, but one doesn't mind so much when one is hungry.' 'I love the sea-gulls,' said Lotty, 'and they all love me, and don't mind coming close up; and then they are so neat and so clean, never a feather awry, and with eyes ever so clear and bright. I think they are just little bits of the waves with souls put into them.' When Lotty got on deck she could hardly keep upright, for it was blowing half a gale from the west, and now the bonny bark, with her close-reefed topsails and storm staysails, was standing nor'-east, and away where black clouds had painted the sky from zenith to horizon. The girl looked a queer figure--a wee sou'-wester on her head, which could not hide her hair nor her beauty, and a huge pilot jacket belonging to Ben, the sleeves a bit too long and the garment itself coming right down to her heels. She swayed and swayed till the red-faced mate came to her assistance, tucked her under his arm, and trotted her off for a stroll under the weather bulwarks. Then she felt as if she had been at sea all her life. _Kaye--kaye--kaye!_ screamed the birds, for there were sea-gulls even here, playing at tack and half-tack around and over the quarterdeck, darting through the fountainheads of wind-vexed seas, circling, swirling, swishing in every beautiful attitude conceivable--_kaye--kaye--kaye_! Oh, how happy, how glorious, those feathered children of the ocean! Lotty just longed to catch one, tie a message to its leg, kiss it, and tell it to fly home with this to the little gipsy camp by the lone seashore. Up and down, fore and aft, the two walked together, and the girl thought she could never tire listening to the mate's strange stories of the sea, while he was quite as pleased to have so innocent and sweet a listener. So a whole hour passed quickly by, and then something happened. A full-rigged ship was seen bearing towards them from afar, very close-hauled and with snow-white sails. 'A Yankee from Bergen, I'll lay my last sixpence on that. I'll try to speak her if she crosses our hawse, and tell her you are safe.--Ben!' he shouted. 'Ben, my boy, look lifty.' 'Ay, ay, sir.' 'Bring my megaphone.[D] Sharp's the word, lad; quick's the action.' Next minute Ben had hurried aft, and presented his superior officer with a large tea-tray and a lump of chalk. 'A very old-fashioned arrangement,' he said, 'but does well enough for us.' In huge letters on the back of his 'megaphone,' as he grandly termed it, he hastily wrote: 'TIMBER-SHIP _Nor'lan' Star_--CAPT. PATERSON. 'CHILD GIRL PICKED UP AT SEA, WHICH HER NAME IS LOTTY LEE. 'REPORT TO LLOYDS.' Then he took his stand on the grating right abaft the wheel, and held the tea-tray aloft. With her cloud of snowy canvas on came the Yankee. Then, as she was passing, a real megaphone roared out the words: 'The _Louisiana_ of Baltimore, U.S.A., bearing up for London, England, _en route_ for the States. What is that?' continued the awful voice. 'Hold your bally old tea-tray higher. Captain Peters, eh? Little girl born at sea. All right, I'll report it. Hope mother and daughter are doing well. Love to the missus. Good-bye, old grampus; _bon voyage_.' Next minute the _Louisiana_ was past and away, and the mate dashed the tea-tray on the deck with a rattle and a word that made Lotty jump. 'Hang the fellow!' he cried; 'he couldn't read plain English, and now he's off, and may all the bad weather go with him, for he'll report that Mrs Paterson---- Ha, ha, ha!' He laughed louder than the west wind as he jumped down. 'Never mind. Come along, Lotty, and we'll have another stroll. Merrily does at sea, little lass. With a he! and a ho! How the wild winds blow, As we go rolling home, brave boys, As we goes a-rolling home!' The gale moderated considerably in the first dog-watch, and the sea became smoother. Reefs were shaken out, and as the sun set red in the nor'-west a heavenly starlit night succeeded the stormy day. Ben went on watch at eight o'clock, and the rest settled around the stove in the cosy octagonal cabin. They were plain-living people in the _Nor'lan' Star_, as all true sea-folks are. The skipper smoked in his easy-chair, Mrs Paterson sat knitting in hers, with Lotty on a footstool by her knee, and the red-faced mate between. The steward brought tumblers to these two men-people, so they sipped their grog and then settled to yarning and singing. So soft, so sweet, yet so ringing withal was the good mate's voice as he gave his rendering of the 'Bay of Biscay' and 'Tom Bowling' that Lotty had tears in her eyes; but she clapped her little hands as he finished. 'Oh, how much I love that!' she cried with real enthusiasm; 'and oh, Mr Mate, how delighted my daddy Biffins Lee would be to have you in our camp! People would come from all directions to hear you sing real sea-songs like that.' The mate laughed. 'I fear,' he said, 'I should make but a poor gipsy. But why do you like my songs, little lass?' 'Because I hear things in them.' 'Hear things in them?' 'Yes, oh yes, for as you sing I can hear the woesome wail of white-winged gulls as they beat to windward in the dark-cloud sky, dipping now and then down, down till they touch the darker water and dive through the spray, then up and up, screaming, till the haze hides the silver of their flight. And I can hear the storm wind too, sir, rising and falling, falling and rising, so mournful-like because of the quiet sleeping dead that lie so far beneath the waves upon the yellow sands.' Lotty was blushing now at her own youthful enthusiasm, and was fain to hide her face on Mrs Skipper's lap. And Mrs Skipper patted the shapely yellow poll. 'So we've really picked up a little poet, have we, from off the stormy main? said Mr Mate. 'Lotty,' cried the captain suddenly, 'you can sing I'm sure!' The blue, sparkling eyes glanced upwards through the tousled hair. 'Yes,' she replied, 'I sing always in the show. I have a mandoline. Have you a mandoline?' 'No, just the fiddle.' 'Oh, that will do. It is tuned the same. Thanks, not the bow, only my fingers.' The child's voice was very beautiful, and almost sad were the songs she sang. The skipper beckoned to the steward and pointed to the empty tumblers. Then he threw back his head in his easy-chair and shut his eyes. 'Sing again, my sweet,' he said. Lotty did, and once more too. And the ship swayed and swung in rhythm, while Mrs Skipper, though her eyes were on her work, forgot to knit. 'Maggie, lass,' said the captain as a song was ended, 'Maggie, dear wife, I feel sure, quite sure, I saw a tear drop down upon your wool. There! I was sure of it. Your eyelashes are wet.' Well, maybe--who knows?--this kindly, homely skipper's wife had a bit of romance buried away back in her past. But that evening was a happy one to all, and so were many more that followed. CHAPTER XIV. A LITTLE STRANGER COMES ON BOARD. 'Somehow, husband,' said Mrs Paterson to her spouse next day when they were alone together in the cabin, 'I feel strangely drawn towards that child, Lotty.' 'She's a charming little thing, I must say. Glad we picked the mite up.' 'But,' continued his wife, 'with me there seems something more than mere interest, George.' 'What mean you, wife?' 'I wish I could explain to you, but I can't even to myself. But did you never think, dear, that the very expression of someone, a long time dead and gone, may be seen again in the face of the living?' 'I can't quite follow you.' 'Neither can I follow myself,' said the good woman, smiling somewhat sadly; 'but'---- * * * * * This was going to be a real holiday for Lotty, and in her youthful capacity for pleasure she was going to make the best of it. She had not to beckon pleasure to come to her, it was coming, and would come without being asked. The very novelty of her situation and surroundings was enthralling. She had come or been brought into an entirely new world. It felt as if Providence or Chance had staged for her a fresh and startling drama--new scenery, new acting, new everything--and she had nothing to do but wait and look on and be glad. The weather got wilder, the skies harder and clearer, each wave that passed, as it swirled and broke, sang to itself in the blue and frosty air. Even the spray that dashed inboard fell rattling on the skylights like hail, and sometimes quite a little snowstorm raged on the deck, the powdery snow forming into small, shapely drifts against the coiled ropes or the green-painted lower bulwarks. For the first day or two Ben appeared shy and half-afraid of Lotty. To him she was a being from another world, such as he had only read of in fairy-story books. But he soon got over his timidity, and was bent apparently on becoming her slave, was pleased to explain things to her, and assist her in every way his somewhat slow nature might suggest. Then when she went off to stroll arm-in-arm with the mate, whom she liked much better, he would lean himself slantingly--as you might lean a garden-fork that you didn't want to fall--against the lee bulwarks amidships, and dreamily watch her every look and movement. When she would come towards him at last he was all alive again, and as eager-eyed and sprightly as a sheep when she sees the lamb she has to protect. Perhaps the conversation was a trifle slow, because she had to pull him into it. Ben wasn't very suggestive. Nevertheless, his somewhat dull eyes sparkled with delight, and his face became transformed, in a manner of speaking, when he found that he could give Lotty information and interest her in things. Beauty has a wonderful power if it be beauty of the right sort, consisting not merely in a lovely complexion, eyes, hair, and features, and a nice figure, but all these etherealised--nay, but glorified--by refinement, intellect, and innocence. Such a child as Lotty, wholly insensible of the charm that surrounded her, was likely to, and did, make friends wherever she went. And it is better to make friends than conquests. 'You've been up this way before, Ben, haven't you?' 'Ah! lots o' times.' Silence for some seconds. 'Have you a full name? Ben isn't surely all.' 'A fool name, little un?' 'I mean what more than Ben is it?' 'Ah, lots, but I doesn't trot 'em out every day.' 'Ben what, then?' 'No, not Ben Watten, but Benjamin Thorley Metcalfe Evans Bradley; only they's all melted down to Ben aboard ship.' 'Have you ever been farther north, Benjamin Thor'---- 'Oh don't, little missie. Ben's the 'andle they allers lifts I by. Yes, been to Archangel an' Iceland an' Spitzbergen 'arf a dozen times.' 'Were you always second-mate?' 'Lo'd no! Dog-boy fust, then slush-boy, then dirty-devil all over the ship, then stooard's boy, then doctor'---- 'Doctor?' 'Ay, missie, wot cooke the 'orse, an' fries the panhaggledy, an' biles the spuds an' the dollop o' duff.' 'How very interesting!' More silence. 'It must be wild and dreary on the sea of ice and snow, and so cold I should freeze to death.' 'Bless yer little 'eart, I tells ye it's just skir-r-rumptious up near wot they calls the Pole, though I never did see un--nary a pole.' As he spoke Ben hung himself up, as it were, on a belaying-pin against the bulwark, and Lotty stood looking at him. But he didn't look at her, only beyond her or over her, for if he had looked right into her face or eyes I'm certain the boy couldn't have spoken a sensible sentence. 'Just skir-r-rumptious! An' those hartist chaps wot 'drors pictures o' hicebergs in books knows nuffin' whatsomediver about it; no more nor they does about their Bibles. Goin' out north that way it's cold enough at fust, like to freeze yer face like heverythink, an' if yer didn't watch the barber 'e'd precious soon cut yer nose right clean hoff.' 'Do you carry a barber?' ‘’E comes an' carries 'isself--comes on board w'en the fermometer's worked away down zero-ways. 'E ain't no man this barber, honly a white mist wot rises off a calm an' frosty sea like the steam from a pot w'en she's beginnin' to boil; an', oh, 'e's a sneezer! 'E 'ardens the beef in the riggin', an' the sheets an' the stays as well, an' 'e 'eats the brass-work an' steel till they burns worse nor 'ot pokers if ye're grampus enough to touch 'em. An' 'e covers the decks an' the skylights an' the boats an' bulwarks, an' man an' beast as well, till the dog's like a Polar bear, an' all 'ands looks like Methuselahs, with white beards an' 'air an' heyelashes. That's wot the barber does, does 'e. But mebbe the sun shines after this. Then heverybody grows young again hall of a suddint, an' the barber flies north to the Pole.' 'Is the ice all like castles and steeples and pinnacled mountains?' 'Honly in pictur'-books, missie.' 'Plenty of skating, I suppose?' 'Lo'd love ye, no. 'Cause as 'ow the big flat or round-topped bergs is hall covered feet-deep in snow.' 'Beautiful white snow, Ben?' She was looking at him eagerly, earnestly. Little though he knew it, this rough, illiterate sailor-boy was showing her glimpses of a new world, which to her young poetic imagination must be all a kind of fairyland. He cast one glance at the sweet face beside him, then hitched himself more firmly on to the belaying-pin and swayed about for a moment in evident shyness. 'Beautiful white snow, Ben, boy. It must be like Elfinland.' 'Never been there myself, missie--to Helfinland I means, though I've 'eard speak o' it. Ye lands from a ship in a boat like, an' as ye gets nearer an' nearer to the pack-edge o' the big drearisome floes the sea hall around yer gets blacker an' blacker till it's just like ink w'en it laps an' laps ag'in' the rainbow ribbon o' icy shore.' 'But it isn't really black, Ben? Don't say it's really black, Ben--the water, I mean.' 'Oh no, missie, it is clear as dew on a rose-leaf, an' it trickles from the oar-blades like diamonds in the sun. Then there is the sky, as blue an' clear it is, just like the 'eaven th' ould pa'son speaks about, only brighter. An' there's the birds--they's beautiful too, 'specially the snow-birds that come so close ye can look into their clear, red eyes, an' could almost shake their cold feet. 'An' w'en ye does land an' goes wanderin' hall by yerself away over the 'ard, crisp snow, ye mebbe meets a bear; but the bright sun's in 'is black eyes, an' 'e just looks at ye an' goes on, for there be seals to catch, an' bladders an' wallies,[E] an' 'e don't want to eat no hooman bein' s'long's 'e can get wallies. But ye goes on an' on.' 'All by yourself, Ben, of course.' 'Well, if ye likes to put it that way. On an' on over sparklin' snow, with the black sea away somew'ere behind, ye don't seem to ken nor care 'ow far, 'cause hevery breath ye breathes is liquid life, an' ye'd raither not look back. There ye sits ye down on a 'ummock an' startles now to find the sea 'as gone. That's the wu'st o' walkin' on the hice, ye walk so far an' never gets tired. Ye doesn't min' bein' alone at fust, but after hours it begins to pall on ye, for the silence is fearsome, an', like the cold, creeps up about the 'eart; the sun won't speak to ye, the snow won't talk, an' the birds 'as flown away.' 'But the sea,' said Lotty, 'the sea, Ben?' 'Just like a whisper o' a far-away wind. But the sea is away, an' ye shades yer eyes to look for it. It's gone, an' yer ship. Only a white mist lies yonder, an' it rolls up an' creeps up slowly but sure, an' ye know the mist means death. At fust ye're frightened, an' wish to run to'ards it an' fling yerself at it as a man does at a ghost. Then ye screams an' wants to run, then ye sees snowflakes a-fallin' at the other side o' ye, an' ye know then ye're in it, an' 'elpless. But something is shuttin' down yer heyelids, an' a sleep an' a dream ye thinks would be very pleasant--especially the dream. It's the dream that does it, the dream that drags ye into death.' 'Into death, Ben? Death in your fairyland?' 'Ay, death, missie, as sure as hever it came to a barn-door fowl, unless they finds ye. Then, missie, the fust-mate brings ye up out o' the dream an' out o' the death with a bally rope's-endin' for leavin' the boat.' * * * * * The ship sailed northwards and north, and King Winter now met the _Nor'lan' Star_ in icy earnest, for they passed through great fields of half-melted snow that took the way quite out of her, and caused the sails to flap, despite the wind, which, however, was none too favourable. Then there was more blue-black polished sea, rendered blacker still when streams of icebergs, mostly snow-clad, met them and bombarded the ship on both sides with deafening noise as they sailed through. But there were bigger pieces, and one was a gigantic white berg with clear, icy sides glittering green and crimson, and on this lay a poor little lost sealkin. Kind-hearted Paterson lowered the dingy after getting the mainsail aback, and Lotty jumped with joy when she was asked if she would like to go. How very large and dark the hull of the _Nor'lan' Star_ appeared as they pulled away from her quarter, and the waves now seemed higher than Lotty could have believed possible! They rose and fell, playing such queer capers, racing the dingy, pretending to poop her, changing their minds, and lifting her sky-high only to hurl her down again into the blackness between two seas! So Lotty had to keep her eyes fixed on the berg and the sleeping sealkin to make sure they were advancing. But when she looked about, the _Nor'lan' Star_ seemed miles away. The mate was steering. 'She won't forget and sail away and leave us, will she?' said Lotty. 'I don't think so, my dear, else we'll have to do what four of us did once when we were cast away on an iceberg like that, only a trifle bigger. And there was a seal on it too, else we couldn't have lived for three long weeks as we did.' 'Did you kill it and eat it?' 'Oh dear no, Lotty. We found out a trick worth two o' that. 'We hauled up the boat after capturing that saddle-back, not that she was much use, but she would do as a kind of bedroom you know, although she wouldn't float. She would keep the cold wind off us, and it is warmer sleeping on planks than on snow. 'Well, Lotty, we hadn't much to eat the first day, and slept but badly after it. The second day we had less, and then we began to starve--ay, and would have starved, too, but for an idea that Nat Pringle got hold of. For the saddle-back had gone. "I have it, mates," he said. Then he got straight up and walked to the boat, and back he comes with a big net and a long rope. We lay and watched after sunset, for it was early in the Greenland year, and by-and-by up comes the seal, and Nat lays hold on it quick, and in two minutes it was dressed in the net, as you might dress a doll, nothing out 'cept the head, the flippers, and the tail. That was a weary night, but joy came in the morning. "I'm off," says the seal, turning head on to the water. "Oh, are ye?" says Nat. "Well, good-day, and pleasant voyage to you." 'Away goes the seal, but the long rope was fastened by one end to the net behind its shoulder, and Nat kept firm hold of the other. "Hallo!" says the seal to himself after he had swam about thirty yards, "I'm fast, it seems. Well," he says, "I may as well have my breakfast anyhow." 'So he dives like an eel, and up he comes with a fine big cod in the jaws of him, and Nat and another hand bent on to that rope, and before you could have said marling-spike they had landed seal and cod all complete. 'The saddler put down the cod, looking a kind of discomfited like. "Oh, ye can go back again, my birkie," says Nat, "and have your own breakfast. This will last us for the day." 'And sure enough we killed and cooked the cod, and the seal had fair enough play, for he was left to fill himself in the sea till we had picked the last bone. And every day we did the same, all the time we lay on that berg. And it wasn't cod every day either; oh no, as often as not 'twas salmon, or hal'but, or young sturgeon. 'But all the while that iceberg was getting smaller and beautifully less, but at long last a merciful Providence sent a steamer our way, and so you see---- Easy pulling, boys! Way enough. There we are!--Jump on shore, Ben, and hand up the little lady.' The seal was a baby one, and as lovely as a young lamb, and looked for all the world like a pretty infant swathed up to the eyes in soft white flannel. Only, no baby in all the wide world ever had such large and melting eyes. 'You've pulled well, lads,' said the mate, 'and all against the current too. So you can have fifteen minutes of a rest, a smoke, and a tot of rum each, then we'll start for off again.' Lotty was charmed. She wanted to play at a game of romance, so she lifted the baby seal in her arms and went away with it to a hummock of snow on this great berg, quite out of hearing of anybody, and sat down with nothing before her except the world-wide waste of ocean that went stretching away without break to the haze of the limitless northern horizon. She was trying to fancy herself all alone on the sea of ice, with only her fairy godmother who had for the time being turned herself into a beautiful wee baby sealkin. CHAPTER XV. 'I WANT TO DREAM THAT DREAM AGAIN.' The baby sealkin became a great pet on board and a kind of bond of union between Ben and Lotty. This sailor wasn't much over sixteen, just young enough still to delight in a game of make-believe. So he was papa and Lotty was mamma to young Norlans. And without a doubt, Norlans was the sweetest and the prettiest and the best-behaved baby that ever lived, and boy and girl nursed it time about--that is, when Ben's watch wasn't on deck Norlans's fur was so long that it had to have a bib when it was being fed. There wasn't a cow on board, but there were lots of condensed milk and gulls' eggs, and a sop was made of these, which his little lordship condescended to suck up as long as Lotty kept a finger in his mouth and his nose in the bowl, but no longer. But he also had fresh fish, for they got becalmed on a sandbank, which no doubt had been an island once upon a time in the world's history, and Norlans's daddy got out his lines, and, baiting his hooks with only little tufts of gulls' white feathers, soon caught a tubful. The small ones were all kept alive to feed Norlans, and the pretty mite seemed to grow in strength and even size every day after this. As the captain's wife was fond of pets of all kinds she made no objection to Lotty's taking Norlans down to the saloon and to the stateroom or sleeping-cabin every night. The latter was occupied now only by Mrs Skipper--as the men called her--and our heroine, Ben having been banished forwards, so that the mate had his bunk, and Paterson had the mate's cabin. It is a fine thing for a sea-captain to be allowed to take his wife with him. It is romantic too, and makes a honeymoon last for years, if not for ages. Before getting spliced, which he was wise enough not to do until he was a full-blown master-mariner, Paterson had always looked forward to having his Maggie with him at sea. It had been the dream of his life, and lo! it was fulfilled, the fact being that the sailor had worked out its fulfilment. When visiting his _fiancée_ while only a mate he used to sing to her snatches of an old song which I have almost forgotten; but one verse runs through my brain as I write: Here in my proud ship Upon the waters wide, I roam with a glad heart, Maggie's by my side; My own love, Maggie dear, Sitting by my side; Maggie dear, my own love, Sitting by my side. Well, Norlans had any amount of nursing and really appeared to like it. If Lotty put him down on the quarterdeck he used to make the most ungainly efforts to waddle after her, often rolling over on his broad back in a very ridiculous attitude. He liked to be scratched under the chin and beneath the ear. He liked better to be nursed by his ma than his daddy; for when Lotty would say to Ben, 'Here, papa, you take Norlans for a bit,' the mite would roll those marvellous eyes of his round at the rough boy, then back pleadingly towards the gipsy lass's face; and if she said, 'Well, well, then, he sha'n't be taken by daddy,' he would nestle closer to Lotty, and soon be fast asleep. As Ben said, he could do with bucketfuls of sleep. With fur four inches deep, one wouldn't have thought Norlans could have felt cold at night; but he was not averse, nevertheless, to be put to bed in his small tub rolled up in a red blanket. Then Lotty would sit down on a footstool beside him, and sing a cradle-song till he dropped off into 'little sweet snores' as she called them, and he never stirred till morning. Was he not, therefore, the best baby that ever lived? The days were very short up north in these seas. A steamer would have been into her port long ago; but the _Nor'lan' Star_ had to wait for the wind. Only, Lotty rather liked the length of the voyage than otherwise. By the time Saturday came round she had been nearly a week on board. Well, the skipper was fond of old-fashioned seaways, so he was wont to splice the main brace on this night, which means that all hands have extra grog and spend the evening singing and yarning and drinking to wives and sweethearts. But Lotty had put Norlans to bed early, and was going herself soon after she had a warm bath. It was while assisting her that Mrs Paterson made a discovery which caused her to start and turn first red and then pale. 'Dear Mrs Captain, you're not ill, are you?' 'Oh no,' said the good lady, 'only a momentary spasm. Now it is gone.' There was electric light in this cabin, which was really one of the prettiest staterooms any master-mariner could have wished to have. Of course his wife was the presiding genius; but without being at all overcrowded, because all the fittings were of fairy-like dimensions, it was really home-like and charming. Besides, a dear wee brass-domed stove burned cheerily in a corner, and altogether it was as much like the interior of a caravan as anything else. To-night, after Lotty had got into her dressing-gown and hammock-socks, Mrs Paterson sat down on a low rocking-chair close to the fire, and took her on her knee. And there was a nice drink for both of them keeping hot on the stove-top, so one may easily guess they were cosy. The skipper and mate were smoking and yarning outside in the saloon; but from the stateroom their voices sounded only like the happy murmur of the sea on a summer's beach. What was the discovery the good lady had made? It was a birth-mark--nay, but two. And although such marks might be similar on two different people, so strange a coincidence has never, perhaps, been known. And so Mrs Skipper thought she knew now some secret of Lotty's history that the child herself was ignorant of. A rocking-chair at sea is a delightful contrivance when the weather is fine, as it was to-night, and this one was swayed or swung only by the vessel's gentle motion. It is a dreamy, drowsy movement; but there was no thought of sleep in Lotty's mind at present, nor in Mrs Paterson's. Lotty would have preferred to listen to a story or to hear a song. 'Sure I'm not too heavy, nursie?' 'Oh no,' was the answer, 'you are very light. Besides, darling, it is not the first time that'---- Then she checked herself, and Lotty undertook to finish the sentence. 'Not the first time you've nursed a little girl, you were going to say.' 'Ye-es,' assented the other. Lotty snuggled closer to her. 'I wish you were my mother. But I never had a mother, never, never, _never_. May I call you mammy?' 'You may call me mammy.' Lotty had not seen that tear. This strange child had her sentimental moments, and had come through grief enough, goodness knows; but somehow mirth was never far away from sorrow. 'So now,' she cried, 'I have a ma, and Norlans has a grandma.' 'Lotty, think now,' said Mrs Skipper, 'were you always, always a little gipsy lass? Think back child.' The girl sat up more, to look the better at the kindly face and eyes. 'Always,' she said slowly. 'Only,' she added, 'there have been times when, if I happened to be in the house of some rich and beautiful lady, reading her palm you know, mammy, I've thought it strange that many things I saw, which most gipsy girls might not have known the use of, were to me quite familiar.' 'Yes?' 'The first harp I saw did not seem to have been the first. When asked to play the piano, nothing about it struck me as new, and I felt familiar with even the smallest of my drawing-room surroundings.' 'Yes?' 'But I know how to account for all that.' 'Well, dear?' 'It all comes, mammy, of reading books of romance and stupidity; and some such stories I quite believed when quite a little tot, especially about the baronet's baby-boy who was stolen by a bad sweep, and who, years and years afterwards, was called to a great house to sweep chimneys and found his real mother, and lived happy ever after. But I'm wiser now, mammy dear. Now, mammy, will you do the first thing I ask you?' 'Yes, child.' 'Well, look there! I've finished my nice drink, and now sing me a song, and I'll fall as sound asleep as your grandchild Norlans. Then don't wake me, but just lift me into bed.' Mammy had a sweet voice, and knew also how to modulate it, so softly, tenderly she sang: [Illustration: THE WIDOW'S LULLABY. O safely sleep, my bonnie, bonnie bairn, Rock'd on this breast o' mine, The heart that beats sae sair within Will not, will not awaken thine. Lie still, lie still, ye cankered thochts, That such late watches keep, And if ye break the ] [Illustration: mother's rest, Yet let, yet let my baby sleep. ] Sleep on, sleep on, my ae ae bairn, Nor look sae wae on me, As if ye felt the bitter tear That blin's thy mammie's e'e. Dry up, dry up, ye saut, saut tears, Lest on my bairn ye dreep, And break in silence, waefu' heart, And let my baby sleep. If you know it not, oh reader! take lute or viol and learn it. At the second verse Lotty had really dropped off to sleep; but as the last words died in cadence soft and sad away she started and shook back her yellow hair. Her open eyes had a strange wildness in them. 'Where--oh, where am I?' Then she smiled and seemed to recover consciousness wholly; but she squeezed mammy's arm against her chest with a vice-like grip as she gazed into her face. 'Mrs Captain,' she cried, 'mammy then, I've had such a strange, strange dream. I thought--but never mind, only tell me this: Did you ever sing that strange song to me before? I have never heard it, and yet, mammy, I _have_. How is that? Can you explain?' Mammy did not reply at once. 'I think--I--can--Lotty, child,' she answered slowly. Then more quickly, 'Oh yes, dear, when you have been asleep, I dare say I did sing it to myself, and you have half-heard me.' 'Yes, mammy, yes. That must be the explanation. But now, kiss me and put me to bye-bye. I want to dream that dream again.' CHAPTER XVI. SAFELY BACK TO ENGLAND. There are such things as happy ships still in the merchant service of this country, in which the crew are all, or nearly all, British men, and the captain and mate honest fellows and not tyrants. English or Scotch sailors work well for officers like these, and a bad word is never heard on the ship's decks. The _Nor'lan' Star_ had scarcely changed a hand of her crew for several years. They were like a family in fact. Every one knew his duty and did it. When any dispeace occurred the matter was brought before the captain--of course his word was law; and if there existed a malcontent on board he was very speedily got rid of, for a tainted sheep affects a flock. But, somehow, when a captain takes his wife with him the whole tone of a ship is raised many degrees. But, over and above all this, Captain Paterson owned the ship, or most of her, for the mate and some others had shares, and this arrangement caused things to pull together better. This honest skipper was a good example of what industry and carefulness in business can accomplish, and love with honour, I may add; for he would have told you that the best thing ever he did was marrying Maggie, and taking her to sea with him. Well, the _Nor'lan' Star_ reached Trondhjem at last; and as the men were not drunkards, but knew how to use without abusing God's gifts, every man settled to work, and with the help of dockmen the unloading and the loading-up again proceeded regularly and peacefully enough, and was all over in a week. Then the orders were to clean ship before the granting of a few days' leave off and on to the watches. In a very short time all signs of the loading-up were obliterated, and from stem to stern the _Nor'lan' Star_ looked as sweet and clean as a new half-crown. Ben and the mate had been very busy up till now, but Mrs Skipper had taken Lotty on shore several times. The town, with its great cathedral, was in its winter garb; but they found the streets regular and wide, and even pretty, the older houses being of wood, plain in architecture, but very quaint. There were many fine shops too, and the people therein were kindly in the extreme. Everything here, especially about the suburbs, was very strange and foreign-like, but with none of the fussiness found in French ports, where it is mostly all palaver and insincerity. All her life at present was what, in the case of busy men who have been laid aside for a time by illness, doctors call 'an enforced holiday.' But it was a very delightful and restful one. She was free for a time from the drudgery of show-work, of having to sing and act to crowds of gaping rustics and others; free from the bullying and ill-treatment of her father, Biffins Lee. She only wished that Wallace had been with her now. As for the others--well, they would like her better when she came back from a watery grave, or, more plainly, when the sea gave up the one they all believed dead and gone. But Wallace, what fun he would have had with little baby Norlans, and how he would have rolled him up and down the deck, but gone to sleep afterwards with the sealkin in his arms, like the good dog he was! A tub, both she and Mrs Skipper admitted, was an awkward and somewhat unsightly cot for the sealkin, so they had a look round the toy-shops, and at one they found an assortment of dolls as big as the baby-children of Anak must have been. The shop-mistress curtsied and smiled, and felt certain the young lady would buy one. She raised a garishly dressed specimen as she spoke, which was half-doll, half-golliwog, and hideously ugly. But Lotty was not impressed. She was too old, she said, for dolls like that; but had the good woman bassinets for these? 'Oh yes,' she had, 'lovely little cradles, with rockers and all. Look!' Lotty did look, and was delighted. These were just the thing for Norlans. How sweet he would show in one of these, with its tiny cushion, its muslin drapery, and its blanket of blue! And so one was bought and sent on board. That night Norlans was put to bed in it. Lotty sat down and rocked her baby; and as she rocked she sang a pretty cradle hymn: 'Baloo, baloo, my wee wee thing, Oh, softly close thy blinkin' e'e; Baloo, baloo, my dear wee thing, Now thou art doubly dear to me. Thy face is simple, sweet, and mild, Like ony simmer evenin' fa'; Thy sparklin' e'e is bonny black, Thy neck is like the mountain snaw. Baloo, baloo, baloo.' And baby Norlans was willing to give himself up entirely to the luxury of the situation, and was soon sound enough asleep. Then daddy Ben was called in--he had to walk on tiptoe--to take just one peep at him. 'Isn't he just lovelier than anything on earth, papa?' said Lotty. 'Lovelier,' replied Ben, 'than biled cockles, and every bit as white and clean.' A day or two after this Lotty ran on deck when Ben was hung up as usual on a belaying-pin, the ship having been put to sea again, and it being the lad's watch off. 'Oh papa,' she cried, pretending to be awfully excited, 'you are to run down below at once. Grandma says Norlans has cut a "toofams."' Of course a 'toofams' meant a tooth; and Ben, keeping up the game, went below at once and found it was the truth, and was wise enough to go into raptures over the pearly little appearance. But, happy though his home was, it was evident enough that the sealkin retained a good deal of nature about him, and would fain have obeyed the call of the wild, and plunged right away down into the clear sunny sea, a blink of which he could catch through one of the scupper-holes on the lee side. And always now, when taken on deck for what Lotty termed his constitutional, it was towards a lee scupper-hole he crawled or waddled his way, and seemed never to tire watching the waves. Sometimes when there was a freshening breeze, with plenty of sail on her, the sea would gurgle up as she dipped to leeward, and some portion would be under water. Then Norlans spread his flippers at once and made pretence to swim, and had to be taken away to be towelled and placed in the sunshine to dry. It was about this time that Mrs Skipper had a quiet talk with her husband, and told him about those curious birth-marks, and what she half-suspected, and what she was going to do about it. Even the mate was taken into confidence and his advice asked. But he had not much to give. He really was both innocent and good, but knew more about handling a ship than anything else. 'Seems to me, Mrs Captain,' this was all he said, 'as how it is a 'tarposition o' Providence from first to last. And He--the great Power above us all--does move in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.' 'Well,' said Mrs Paterson, 'you are both men-people and have your reason to guide you. I am only a woman-person, and have merely my instinct; but, Providence here or Providence there, something tells me that a great wrong has been done to that dear child, and mebbe we may be put in the way to redress it.' 'That is,' said the mate solemnly, 'if your suspeecions is right, Mrs Captain. If they's wrong, then'---- 'Well, then, of course, there will be no harm done, only we must take good care to say nothing to Lotty one way or another till we see.' 'That's right, that _is_ right, Mrs Captain; and I'm truly glad I've given you good advice, which I hope you won't be above thinking over.' As the honest mate had given no advice, one way nor another, it certainly would not take very long to think it over. That was a somewhat rough and stormy passage homewards; but the wind was for the most part fair, and under such circumstances she 'skeeted' along like a water-witch, and in due time the cliffs of Old England hove in sight far off on the lee-bow, lying along like a gray cloud on the horizon. Lotty could scarcely believe she was so near, for the voyage out had been a lengthy one, and so many things had happened since she was picked up by the _Nor'larn' Star_ that she felt quite a year older at the very least. That last evening the boy Ben was very sad indeed. 'Which,' he said to Lotty, 'we've 'ad a 'igh old time of it, missie; but lor! it's gone now, and we'll maybe never see ye in life again--no, nor Norlans either.' 'Oh,' said Lotty, with an attempt at good-humour, 'Norlans will be a big boy before he sees his papa again. I'm going to take him to camp, and some day, perhaps, his daddy will come right away down to see him, and his mammy also.' 'Am just a-goin' to live an' dream about that day, Miss Lotty; an' who knows but that when I'm a capting of a big ship you may not sail along o' me again.' 'Who knows?' answered the gipsy lass. And the last thing the girl saw as she left by the gangway, which led over several vessels before she could reach the quay, was second-mate Ben gazing sorrowfully after her. There were tears in his eyes, too, that he had no need to be ashamed of. And there was more than he looked after the little gipsy lass, and waved her a hearty good-bye, for her presence on board had really brought light and joy to many a man of the _Nor'lan' Star_. There was nothing at present to keep Mrs Captain Paterson on the vessel, so she went with Lotty back home to her house in the outskirts. About all Lotty's luggage was Norlans in the bassinet, and that had been sent on before by a trusty messenger. There was a beautiful garden here, but just exactly what Norlans thought of it may never be recorded; for he was to be taken to the camp anyhow, and would be more at home within sound of the sea. * * * * * Just two days after this, Frank Antony Blake received a letter, and was a very happy man. It enclosed a note for Mr Biffins Lee. The letter to Antony was quite a girl's, round-hand, language, and all; but so innocent, for it gave Antony orders which he was to pass on to Mary, with a detailed list of the articles of clothing she was to forward to care of Captain Paterson of the bark _Nor'lan' Star_, Hull, and the amount of money Mary was to ask Biffins for and send with the things. It is needless to say there was joy now in the camp, and somehow it seemed to communicate itself even to Wallace the Newfoundland. We never know just how much a dog understands. Mary was daft with delight. Chops was 'blubbering'--an ugly word; but it was one of the fat boy's own, and when interpreted means 'weeping.' For it is not grief only which is capable of bringing salt tears to one's eyes. Frank Antony Blake did not take long to make up his mind as to what he should do on this occasion. He thought, anyhow, that a railway journey would do him no harm; but really, when he arrived at last, and Lotty threw herself right into his arms to do a good cry, he thought it was the most natural thing in the world to fold her to his breast. He did not like Hull, simply because he did not like cities; and so, after thanking, and more than thanking, the captain, his wife, and mate for all their kindness to Lotty, and hoping to meet them again, he took first-class tickets, and soon the fast train was bearing them back to the north, baby Norlans and all. He had wired to Crona to have Wallace at the cottage, and she had gone over on purpose to bring the faithful dog to her hut. But no pen could portray the delight of this dear fellow when he was sent off with a rush and a run to meet Lotty and Antony slowly winding their way uphill to Crona's cottage. CHAPTER XVII. LIFE ON THE ROAD IN THE 'GIPSY QUEEN.' Frank Antony Blake had certainly not been hard upon the handsome banking account which his father had so generously placed at his disposal when he told him to go and have his fling for a few years, or until he should come of age. Perhaps Antony was neither better nor worse than the average modern son. For, of course, there are modern sons as well as modern fathers; but the sin of extravagance was not one that could be laid to this young fellow's charge. He liked to have one penny to rattle against another simply for comfort's sake. Luxuries he considered rather effeminate, and could do without them. Now, however, he was going to let the wind into his banking account to the extent of purchasing a team of four as good horses as could be had in the Granite City, to which he paid a visit. He had been among horses all his life, and knew a horse at sight, and to me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He just wants to fuck me. He really cares about me. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. - Uh-oh. - What? I ended on a "he loves me not". Does this little one count? - Nope. Not if you don't want it to. - There's two there. There's two. - There are not two. - Make it not count. It's one. He loves me. All right. Warren told me that Edie Sedgwick-- she wanted to meet him, so he said, "Okay," because he was curious, as any red-blooded American male would have been. She came over, and he said she had a completely see-through raincoat on and nothing on underneath it. - lsn't that funny? - Mm-hmm. He didn't fuck her. Isn't that unusual? Do you really like them? What do you think People magazine is gonna say? Hey, remember when I told Warren to bring me a present? He did. He bought me this really cool shirt from Dolce Gabbana. See? I get what I want. Yeah, may I speak to Warren Beatty, please? He doesn't even have a fake name. Warren, you're supposed to be here. It's 5:30. If you don't get over here now, I'm leaving without you, you know. I did too! I never said that. What an asshole. Ow! I had a dream last night that Gorbachev came to my show. My first reaction was... that Warren Beatty was gonna be so jealous that I got to meet him first. Anyway, it was a good dream. The police are here, and, uh... This just in. They say that you can't do the masturbation scene tonight, otherwise you'll be arrested. - Really? - Uh-huh. Well, good. Let's see what happens. They will do it. What will they do? Jump on stage? - No, they'll wait till after the show. - They'll arrest you after the show. - Are you guys serious? - l'm serious. - Totally serious. - Clay is down there with Freddy. So, what's considered masturbation? When you stick your hand in your crotch. But then another one of our options is to cancel the show. - We can choose that option. - lt's your choice, sir. We don't have to play. We're asking for that opportunity. It's your choice. Whatever you want to do. It's all in your hands. - Then will we have to pay a fine? - We have to cancel the show. They'll probably take you to the station and write you a ticket. You'll have to pay a fine, and you'll be in every paper. Yeah! I'm not changing my fucking show. I think I need some legal advice from a Canadian attorney before I make a decision. Come talk to me without everybody else. - You're lying. - l am not lying. I swear to God. The police are there and a representative from the DA's office. Two plain-clothes policemen saw the show yesterday. - And they said? - "immoral live performance." You shouldn't have told me, Chris. Well, I wanted to prepare you that there's police standing down there. - Did you guys hear? - What? - That the police are here. - Why? If I touch my crotch during the show, I'm going to be arrested. - Are you serious? - What? ! Are they backstage now? They arrested Bobby Brown for fucking on stage. - Did they? - They arrested him for fucking on stage. - That's called jealousy. - l hope he's in jail when I get there. The question is, does it help legally-- Strictly as a legal question, if we go out on stage, someone says, "This show may contain graphic material"? - Doesn't work. No, not here. - "Anyone chooses to leave--" We're going to jail. I'm so excited. - Dear Lord... - Shh! Shh! This is our last night in Toronto-- the fascist state of Toronto. I know all my little babies are feeling fragile, and I just want you all to know that I love you all and I appreciate everything that you're doing for me, and I'm here if you need me. I want you to go out there tonight and give everything that you have. Have a great show, and remember that in the United States of America, there is freedom of speech. And--And let's kick ass. Yeah! - Have a great show. - Are we gonna go to jail or what? Freddy, I ain't changing my show. I'll tell you what will happen, and I'll give you the options. They just told me that there's been complaints that your simulated orgasms, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, is against their rules and regulations, blah, blah, blah, blah- l am not changing my show, Freddy. - l know you're not changing. But would you wait five minutes till I straighten it out? - What's to straighten out? - Hopefully we can change their mind. Hopefully you can just grab your crotch and not get arrested. Freddy, all you have to do is tell them I am not changing my show. I am an artist, and this is how I choose to express myself. We already did that. So, then what do you have to tell them? Don't let them take me! We shall overcome - We shall overcome - Oppression! I understand. She has told me that this is artistic freedom, this is her show. It's gone on in several countries in major cities across the world, and if Canada, you know-- if you choose to do that, I'm sure it'll be an international scandal. I need to explain over here. - Your name, sir? - DeMann. God! Everything's gonna have a whole new meaning in the show. Like when I say "God" and everything, I'll be praying that I don't get arrested. - Uh-huh. - Where else am I nasty? - Everywhere. - Oh. That's the thing--we're gonna realize tonight how many places we do things. Say, "Hello, Toronto. Do you believe in freedom? "l got something to say about it." - Come on. - That's it, then. - Chris, don't let them take me. - We won't. Celebration Come together in every nation That's right! Holiday Celebration Come together in every nation I'll get arrested for that. The consequences is they may detain her after the show and basically charge her with indecency. Last time I was on tour, Sean was in jail. I guess it's my turn. She'll do it, but she won't do it, like-- l'll bet she does it more. - How much do you want to bet? - Let me find something small. - l'll trust you. - Nah, nah. I've made it through the wilderness Somehow I made it through Didn't know how lost I was Until I found you I was beat incomplete I'd been had I was sad and blue But you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel Shiny and new Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your heart beats Next to mine Gonna give you all my love, boy My fear is fading fast Been saving it all for you 'Cause only love can last You're so fine And you're mine Make me strong Yeah, you make me bold 'Cause your love thawed out Yeah, your love thawed out What was scared and cold Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your heart beats Next to mine Whoa, whoa, whoa Ahh. Whoa, whoa, whoa You're so fine And you're mine I'll be yours Till the end of time 'Cause you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel I'd nothing' to hide Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your heart beats Next to mine Like a virgin Ooh, ooh Like a virgin Feels so good inside When you hold me And your heart beats And you love me God? Spokesmen for rock singer Madonna say Metro Police and the Crown Attorney's office threatened to arrest the star last night for lewd and obscene behavior. However, the police department tonight has a different story. Headquarters said officers checked out the show on complaints from the public, found nothing wrong and left without incident. Madonna released a statement from Michigan tonight saying she would rather cancel the show than alter it. Detroit was definitely the hardest place we went to on the tour on an emotional level. God, going home is-- Well, it's just never really that easy for me. People always talk about how stardom changes you, but... they never talk about how it can change the people close to you. - Hi, Marty. - Who is that? How's it going? - This is my brother, Martin. - Hi, Marty. This is Donna. Don't pay any attention to her. Niki, aren't you gonna say hi to Marty? Hi, Martin. I feel that there is a pressure because of my sister. People are looking at me, going, "How come you're not that? "How come you're not the manager? "How come you're not this, the other, that, and blah, blah, blah? "You should be this, she's that. You should be that." There is something that they measure against you. And sometimes I cop an attitude about it, but I deal with it. Well, she's available. Why don't you go talk to her? She's taking a nap right now. Oh, is she? I'm gonna be back here probably-- l don't know--7:00. All right. Well, I can't see anybody till after the show, so, yeah, Clay will hook you up. - Sounds good. I'll see you, honey. - All right. Yeah, we're tight, you know. We talk and stuff. She gives me advice. I give her a few tips, and she gives me a few tips. We really have a give-and-take relationship, you know? We can get past that star bullshit, you know? She knows what time it is with me, and I know what time it is with her. Dear Lord, it seems like every time I'm standing in this circle before the show, I'm asking you for something extra special. Well, I'm here again, and they say, "Ask and ye shall receive," so I'm begging you to give me a voice to sing with this evening, and the girls, too. This is my hometown, so I'm extra nervous. And, even though it's not supposed to matter, it does matter what they think, and so I ask you to give me that little extra something special to show everybody here that I did make something out of my life. Amen. Have a great show. Okay. Well, I said it last night, and I'll say it again. There's no place like home! In addition to that, there's nobody like this man. There's nobody like my father... who's here tonight. And I worship the ground that he walks on. And it's his birthday. And I was wondering if I could sing Happy Birthday to you in front of 20,000 people. Give it up for my dad! Okay, okay. This is my dad. And I was wondering-- would you all sing it with me? All right. Ready? ...day to you Happy birthday to you Come on, I can't hear you! Happy birthday, dear Dad Happy birthday to you Okay. Dad, I love you. Detroit, I love you. Good night. Thank you. So, did my father disown me? - No! - No? - He looked so happy. - Really? Oh, God. I was so afraid to do Like a Virgin. - l could tell you were. - l was like... Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do Okay, I'm done with that now. Oh, my God. I tell you, that was harder to do that show than the police in Toronto. I was more afraid of what my actions would result in. Are you ready for Dad? Dad, you can come in, but I gotta get dressed. Come on in. Hi. I gotta take off my sweaty clothes. Hi. - Hi. - Oh, God, sorry. You're sopped! Sorry. Let me change, okay? - Did you like the show? - lt was great. - Really? - lt was very good. lt was wonderful. A little touchy in spots, but it was great. Okay. Whoo! I didn't expect the Happy Birthday. Oh, man. I tried not to start bawling in front of everybody, you know? It's hard to sing and cry. Now you know why I'm wiped out. Well, just watching it, I mean, it's exhausting just watching everything that's going around. I can't do this for another two months. I'm sure you're relieved that's over, though. - Huh? - That one's over. That was a big one. I'm so tired. I thought, "Jeez, the minute you turn your head, "the stuff is all lit and on the stage." Hi. I'm getting a touch-up. You take a shower already? I never thought I'd see you bow at your father's foot. - l thought that was great! - l never thought I would, either. I was honored. A little taken back, but honored. I thought I had to make up for the fact that I didn't go shopping for a birthday present. Weren't the sets beautiful? Didn't Chris do a great job? Aren't my dancers great? Aren't they fab? It was all great. A couple of scenes there were a little... - X-rated? - We could do without. - Burlesque. - ...were burlesque-- Dad! You don't understand. They all lead to something. - l know they're arty. - lt's got nothing to do with art. It's got nothing to do with art. It's the journey that you go on. It's--lt's-- You get on this train at the beginning, you have to stay on till the end. Exactly. You take a journey. It's cathartic. You can't get to one place without going through another place. I understand. - l hear you. - lt's like growing up. Mm-hmm. Yep, that's what my show is like. She's growing up on stage, right? My brother's gonna come, and if he just has a few friends, that's fine, but if he brings an entourage of people in, then I want you to come in here and be the chaperon, okay? - Because my brother's crazy. - l know it. You have to be nice to him, though. - He can't help it. - Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay, what's my poem, my fart poem? Should I say it? Which one? The one about the beans? I'm replenishing my fluids. A fart is a chemical substance, it comes from a place called Bum. It penetrates through the trousers... and lands with a musical hum. To fart, to fart 'tis no disgrace, for it gives the body ease. It warms the blankets on cold winter nights and suffocates all the fleas! - Here. - And... Angie said. You're not gonna stay and see Marty? - Don't leave me alone. - l'll be here in spirit. Bastard. We went out to get the limousine, and the limousine driver was gone 'cause the guy who owned the limousine service had locked his keys in his car, so I had to sit out there and wait. He probably stopped at a bar for 12 drinks! No, he didn't. He's cleaned up. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Dad says he went to alcohol rehab to escape going to jail. He went there for the wrong reasons. It wasn't proper motivation. He doesn't want to heal himself. Did Martin come yet? - Dean, did he show up yet? - No, I just got here. Okay, thanks. Bye. Martin was supposed to come, but he didn't. Big deal. I think Martin's not coming. I'm going to bed. See, if my brother comes, you just tell him that I'd like privacy, please. - Hi, Martin. - Hi, how are you doing, honey? Listen to that low voice of yours. What y'all doin'? - l made it lower just for you. - What, you been crying? Yeah, it's my Visine. Yeah, my eyes got sore. What you doing? I'm going down to have have a drink with my family. - Oh, okay. You coming back up? - Yeah. - Where's she at? - She's probably sleeping. - ls she? - Most likely. 401 , I gotta find. I'll be right back. - What room are you looking for? - 401 . - lt's right there. - Oh, it's right here? It was right in front of me the whole time. Yeah, she's probably sleeping, man. Good night. Sharon, you know I beat up on girls like you when I was little. l--l-- lt's true. You know who she reminds me of, Chris? Sharon reminds me of the McFarlands. Maureen McFarland. - Hello. Hi. - Are you Moira? Yeah. You guys. No, they're a nice family. But if you think our family's wacky, I won't say any more. There was a time about ten years ago that I was in Colorado, and I was gonna make my way to New York to see her 'cause I knew she was in New York, and... I never made it. I was a dancer on the road, but I was a different kind of dancer. I was a topless dancer. I was real heavy into the drugs. But Moira McFarland taught me how to shave my legs. Oh, you're indebted to her. Let me borrow her stuffed bra. How old were you? Showed me how to use tampons-- not very well, I might add. And taught me how to make out. Madonna, I did not teach you how to insert a tampon. And if we got in bed together naked, I don't remember that. She said she was never in bed naked with me? She's such a liar. She's got an active imagination, though. She's a damn liar. Did she say she finger-fucked me? No. I remember looking at her bush. I know! See what happens when you take drugs and alcohol? I mean, you really-- l lose a lot of stuff. I remember the crack in her parents' bed because it was two beds pushed together. I remember I fell through the crack, you know, 'cause we were jumping up and down on the bed too much...naked. The last time I really saw her before-- before she became a star, whatever-- was when I was in tenth grade. Where's my idol? Where's my idol from ten years ago? I don't know if I'm nervous. I just--l just want to see Madonna. Madonna! - Didn't you recognize me? - l didn't know you were coming out. I don't have my glasses on. I can't see. So, how are you? When you see the show, you'll forgive me for not talking to you. - Oh. - lt's really difficult, so... I know. Well, listen, I got five boys--or I have four-- l gotta ask you something. Can we sit down? I can't sit down. I'm really sorry. Why? What's up? I hate to do this in front of-- About four years ago, I wrote you a letter-- and you never received any of my letters-- and I asked you if you would be Mario's godmother. Yes, I remember that. Did you read the letter? I got it a long time after the fact. - Well, very unexpectedly-- - Uh-huh? Real unexpectedly, I'm pregnant again. Oh, really? Oh, my God. Well, you certainly have been busy. I want you to be--l want you to be the baby's godmother. - Really? - l really do. You're coming to the show tonight, right? And Melissa has all your phone numbers. I know--This is too, like, rushed of a situation. I'm really flattered that you're asking me, but I have to think about it. - Okay. - Okay. But that's really sweet of you. - lt has nothing to do with religion. - l know! - lt has to do with spirituality. - Do I get to decide on the name? Okay. As long as it's the same as yours. Except that's why you've got to bless this child. Please bless this child and say, "She needs a girl." - l'd bless it anyways. - She needs a girl. All right. Have a girl. Have a girl, Moira. - Have a girl, Madonna. - l gotta go. Come out a girl, and we're gonna call you Madonna. - Give me a kiss and a hug. - l love you. - l hope you like the show. - l have something for you. - ls that the painting? - Yeah. I'm gonna put it in my room. Clay, come on. I love this painting, by the way. Thank you. Thanks. - l love you. - l'll put it in my room. I love you, too. - And you call me after the tour. - l will. All right. - You promise? - l promise. Bye. - l love you, Madonna. - l love you, too. You little shit. Look! Moira made this painting for me. She did it herself? She did it herself. It's a Madonna and Child. No pun intended. It's not bad, really. - No. - Really, it's not bad. No, not bad at all. - That's me breast-feeding. - Yeah, I got that. Did you hear me dedicate a song to her? You did? - l did. - l didn't hear that. In Where's the Party. I said, "This one's for Moira-- my childhood idol." I remember praying to Madonna, 'cause-- To her mother, Madonna. You know, it was the closest thing to God. When her mom died, I was a little girl, and I couldn't-- l remember feeling really sad and really awful, and-- But I don't know that anybody went-- l don't remember, like, hugging Madonna and telling her I'm sorry, 'cause I just didn't understand-- l was seven and she was five. So, I just wanted to go back and hug her. Little girl Don't you forget her face Laughing away your tears When she was the one who felt all the pain Little girl Never forget her eyes Keep them alive inside I promise to try But it's not the same I hadn't been to the cemetery since I was a young girl. We used to go right after she died. I don't know, my mother's death was just all a big mystery to me when I was a child, and no one really explained it, so... What I remember most about my mother was that she was-- she was very kind and very gentle and very feminine. I mean, I don't know. I guess she just seemed like an angel to me, but I suppose everybody thinks their mother's an angel when they're five. I also know she was really religious, so I never really understood why she was taken away from us. It just seemed so unfair. I never thought that she had done something wrong, so oftentimes I'd wonder what I'd done wrong. Does she hear my voice ln the night when I call? Wipe away all your tears lt's gonna be all right I fought to be so strong I guess you knew I was afraid You'd go away, too I wonder what she looks like now. Just a bunch of dust. I'm gonna fit in right here. They're gonna bury me sideways. Little girl You've got to forget the past And learn to forgive me I promise to try But it feels like a lie Don't let memory Play games with your mind She's a faded smile Frozen in time I'm still hanging on But I'm doing it wrong I don't want to stay here anymore. Can't kiss her good-bye But I promise to try This is the show that I have no idea what is gonna happen to me and my voice. I don't know where it's gonna come from, but give me a voice and let me put on a great show tonight, and let everybody do the same. Amen. Amen. It's like a dream No end and no beginning You're here with me lt's like a dream Let the choir sing Stand back, please. Let her through. Okay. Now say, "Eeeh." Ahh. Breathe. Okay. - Eeeh. - Ahhh. - Good. Eeeh. - Ahhh. - Eeeh. - Ahhh. - Eeeh, eeeh, eeeh. - Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh. - Eeeh. - Ahhh. Great. Take a breath. Good. This is crazy. Nobody talks about this on film? Talks about what? The insanity of doing this all on a documentary. What? Well, this is a serious matter, your throat, yes? Why should I stop here? - But does anyone say it? - Who's anyone? Well, anyone that comes into this insane atmosphere. You realize they all feel it when they come into this atmosphere. When they come into your dressing room, when they come wherever you are, they feel crazy. - Now, do they talk about it? - No, they accept it. - Why don't they talk about it? - Because. - You want think about that, don't you? - No, I don't. So, let's get back to my throat. Do you want to talk at all off-camera? You have nothing to say. She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk! I think that's what it is. There's nothing to say off-camera. Why would you say something if it's off-camera? What point is there existing? Well, eventually I had to admit that I was a human being, and I agreed to cancel some shows. And I was told by the doctor that I couldn't speak and I had to write everything down on a piece of paper. Melissa, my assistant, became my only link to the outside world. I think, in a lot of ways, New York-- and the time that I spent there while I was sick-- was the hardest on her. And since I was staying in my own apartment in New York, I lost contact with the dancers completely. I had to give all of my messages to Melissa, and, through Melissa, I heard that they were finding a lot to keep themselves busy. I guess I was a little jealous that their lives were going on without me, too. Donna DeLory-- Madonna's back-up singer, also dancer in the tour and everything like that. - Donna, good to have you with us. - Great to be here. Who choreographed that Like a Virgin number? Who do you think? Warren Beatty! To Warren! Donna, I was reading the radio bible, which I happen to have a copy of right here. Oh, yeah! The Star! That is so wrong. That thing is so wrong. Let me just read this first, and then you can comment. "Madonna dumps Beatty for a black dancer." - lt talks about Slam. - Slam? "Supposedly, Madonna swaps Beatty for dancer 31 years younger." First of all, that guy's name is Oliver. - These guys are so wrong. - Really? They didn't even get the name right. No. Hey, this is my first time ever working with fags. I mean, I'm the only straight guy, and there's--what, six of them? We're here, we're queer! Get used to it! Oh, my God. Do you know what else I hate? Have you ever seen Luis walk in just underwear in front ofjust a whole bunch of people? Just walk around in bikini-- l mean, just underwear. Don't have no kind of respect for these people. We know that he's a fag or gay, or whatever you want to call it, but you don't have to show it to everybody. We know you're happy, we know you're glad to be it, but you really don't have to show it, you know, and let everybody know that you're, you know, a fag or whatever. Work it, girl! It was scary, it really was.... 'cause they wanted me. And their thing was, "On this tour we're gonna get him." That's what they told me. When the show started up again, everything felt so different. There was so much tension. I blamed myself. I felt like a mother who deserted her kids, and then comes back home to realize how much trouble they've all gotten themselves into. Don't touch my man, okay? If you go on that property, you're wrong, baby. "Madonna swaps Beatty for dancer 31 years younger. "Madonna has dumped her lover, Warren Beatty, "for a young black dancer with the body of a Greek god "and the stamina of a super-stud." "The new love in her life is 22-year-old Oliver Crumes, "also known as Slam." I just want to tell you that I don't think that you're guilty for that thing in the magazine. I'm not worried about the magazine. Oliver, look, there are always gonna be queens on the rag. You have to just come to expect that of them. You got some press, you got some attention, and they're jealous. "The fact that he's black means nothing to Madonna. "She's attracted to him, body and heart." - But not mind. - Okay. I'm calling you in here to tell you that all that matters is your relationship with me and what you do on stage every night, okay? - l think it's silly. - But you know it's all bullshit. Yeah, I know, but-- But if you know it's bullshit, then why do you let it bother you? It's--l'm not letting none of this bother me. You know, a lot of crazy shit is happening right now, and everybody's gonna have to get over their ego, whatever, and pull this shit-- pull this group together. Please try to rise above it, okay? Don't let it get to you. All right? - Oliver? - Mm-hmm. And please don't give me attitude, because I won't tolerate it. is that it? I understand. I'm just asking, is that it? Yeah, that's it. "During auditions for her Blonde Ambition tour, "she flirted with him openly from day one. "He wasn't the best of the hundreds of dancers auditioning for her." - That's right. - You can say that again! Sometimes I think, "Oliver, can you really dance? Should you be on this tour?" I hate to say it, but that's the way I feel sometimes. And it's not good. lt gets to me. Listen, you guys... I just want to reiterate this thing about Oliver and stuff. Please don't pick on him, okay? I'm not protecting him, and, to tell you the truth, I haven't said a word to him since I got here, but he's gone. I don't know where he is. He's hiding out somewhere, and you three together can be pretty ferocious, so be nice to him, okay? He doesn't have the thick skin that you have. He doesn't have the survival techniques that you guys have, all right? And I want him to perform in the show, okay? Thank you. No problem. I don't believe that you don't remember things like that. How could Sharon not know what happened to her? She said that she thinks someone drugged her. She said she was at the club dancing. FOR A PICNIC? JUST BECAUSE IT'S AL FRESCO, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ANY THE LESS A SOCIAL OCCASION. I'LL GET A TIE. THE CAR'S OUTSIDE, DADDY, BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT. I JUST HAVE TO HAVE A WORD WITH ROSE. NO, NO, I TOLD YOU THAT I HAVEN'T GOT YOUR BALL. RICHARD, DO STOP PLAYING WITH THAT ANIMAL. NO, YOU'RE A LOUSE. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LOUSE. AND WHAT'S MORE YOU'VE GOT HAIRY TOES. YOU'RE THE FIRST MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN WITH HAIRY TOES, TED BUTTERFIELD, AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BAD SIGN-- ROSE, YOU CANNOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO A BUTTERFIELD! GOOD GRACIOUS, GIRL, THINK OF THE BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD. BRIGHT FUTURE? DO YOU KNOW THE BUTTERFIELDS? OF COURSE WE KNOW THE BUTTERFIELDS, WE'VE JUST BEEN THERE. MY SISTER WON'T KEEP YOU A MOMENT, MR. BUTTERFIELD. - WE CALL REGULARLY AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS. - WHAT PLACE OF BUSINESS? MY SISTER'S STANDING HERE IN THE GRIP OF A VERY POWERFUL EMOTION. YOU MUSTN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HER HARSH WORDS. IT'S JUST A CRUST THAT SHE'S HAD TO DEVELOP TO COVER HER PURITY AND SIMPLICITY. WE'RE LIKE THAT AS A FAMILY, HIGHER STANDARDS PREVAIL. MY SON WEARS PURE SILK PAJAMAS. ROSE, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BEHAVE IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE TOWN'S LEADING COMMERCIAL FAMILIES. WHAT COMMERCIAL FAMILY? THE EXECUTIVE MOTOR SHOWROOM, THE GARAGE, THEIR FORECOURT SERVICE IS UNPARALLELED. HE'S NOT THAT BUTTERFIELD. THIS ONE'S A TOTAL DREK WITHOUT A PENNY TO HIS NAME. HMM? AND FURTHERMORE, WILL YOU KINDLY STOP BOTHERING MY SISTER? ! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT FOR? - I LOVE HIM! - HOW CAN YOU LOVE HIM? THE MAN HAS HAIRY TOES. NOW, THAT'S A MUCH SMARTER DADDY WITH THE TIE. WAIT THERE UNTIL WE FETCH YOU. AND DON'T DISARRANGE YOURSELF. - HAS HE GOT A HANDKERCHIEF? - ONE OF ONSLOW'S. IS IT CLEAN? IT'S CLEAN! WHERE IS ONSLOW? I SUPPOSE HE'S STILL IN BED. HE'S NOT STILL IN BED. HE'S GONE TO BORROW A ROOF RACK. - WHAT FOR? - HE'S GOT TO HELP THEIR RALPHIE MOVE SOMETHING. WHATEVER NEXT? IF SOMEONE C- - WOULD--? IF ANYBODY'S LISTENING, I'M UNDER HERE. RICHARD, I TOLD YOU TO STOP PLAYING WITH THAT DOG. I DON'T WANT HAIRS ALL OVER OUR OLD SOFA. DAISY, AS WELL AS A HANDKERCHIEF I THINK DADDY OUGHT TO HAVE A SMALL TOWEL-- CLEANTOWEL. OH, LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES. YOU'RE COVERED IN HAIRS. THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT. FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR I'VE BEEN COVERED IN DOG. WHERE IS EVERYBODY WHEN YOU NEED THEM? ONSLOW'S GONE BORROWING A ROOF RACK, AND THEN HE'S OFF ON SOME APPALLING UNSTYLISH ERRAND FOR THEIR "RAFE." ( horn honks ) ( horn honks ) OH NICE. OH, NO. - THERE GOES DADDY WITH MY TUNA MAYONNAISE. - AND MY CAR. WELL, WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING HIM? I WAS IN THE KITCHEN. I WAS UNDER THE DOG. IMPULSIVE DADDY. I HOPE HE'S NOT GOING TO DRIVE AT SPEEDS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MY CUT-GLASS CONDIMENT SET. IN MY CAR! HOW ARE WE GOING TO CATCH UP WITH HIM? WE'LL HAVE TO GO IN MINE. WHAT TIME IS JILL EXPECTING US? ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, LIZ. WATCH THE-- OH NO! WASN'T THAT RICHARD'S CAR? I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT WAS RICHARD'S CAR. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE DAMN FOOL BEHIND THE WHEEL WAS, ALL I COULD SEE WAS A CAP. A CAR BEING DRIVEN BY A CAP. WHOA! THERE GOES MY ROOF-RACK! HE'S GETTING AWAY! HE'S GOT A NEWER CAR, HASN'T HE? LET'S HOPE HE KEEPS IT THAT WAY. HE'LL SLOW DOWN IN A BIT. WHY SHOULD HE SLOW DOWN? BECAUSE HE GETS TIRED. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE-- HE HAS BURSTS OF ENERGY AND THEN HE GOES TO SLEEP. BEHIND THE WHEEL? THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING. - OH, MY POOR DADDY. - OH, MY POOR CAR! HE DOES. HE COULD BE TALKING TO A PERSON AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SENTENCE, "WHALLOP," HE'S ASLEEP. HE'S SLOWING DOWN. I TOLD YOU. HE'S FEELING TIRED. CAN'T YOU OVERTAKE HIM? ON WHICH SIDE? OH, POOR DADDY, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL OF A STRANGE CAR. IT'S NOT THE CAR THAT'S STRANGE, IT'S YOUR FATHER. I SHOULD BE WITH HIM IN HIS HOUR OF DANGER. HE MIGHT HAVE AN ACCIDENT. I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF HIM LYING INJURED, HIS DEAR BALD HEAD COVERED IN MY TUNA MAYONNAISE. OH, NO! I THINK MY GASKET'S GONE. I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN YOU WERE CHAPLAIN OF A PRISON. WELL, I DIDN'T. I WAS BEGINNING TO SPEAK OUT OF THE SIDE OF MY MOUTH. IT'S A FRIENDLY PARISH HERE. SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE TOO FRIENDLY. NOW, THAT WAS AN EVIL THOUGHT. Daisy: THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE. OH, DAMN, IT'S THE BUCKET WOMAN! - SHOULD YOU BE SAYING "DAMN" LIKE THAT? - NOT NORMALLY, NO. I'M TURNING ROUND. YOU CAN'T TURN ROUND, YOU HAVE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. OH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. DAMN, IT'S THE VAMPIRE SISTER! YOU WERE RIGHT, TURN ROUND! TURN ROUND! I CAN'T TURN ROUND NOW, THEY'VE SEEN US. MAY I BE OF ANY HELP? THAT'S VERY, VERY KIND OF YOU, VICAR. PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE US A LIFT? IT'S NOT OUR CAR, OF COURSE, WE'RE JUST HERE ON CHARITABLE PURPOSES. - ROOM FOR A COUPLE. - THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, VICAR. - THANK YOU, VICAR. - THANK YOU, VICAR. TA, VICAR. ( barking ) - Richard: OH, NO. - DOWN, GIRL. I DO THINK HE'S GOT LOVELY HAIR FOR A VICAR. I CAN'T THINK HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I LAST SAT ON YOUR LAP, ONSLOW. IT MAKES YOUR EYES WATER, I KNOW THAT. HOW FARES THE CHURCH WORLDWIDE THEN, VICAR? FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT IS THE MISSIONARY POSITION IN CHINA THESE DAYS? I THINK THAT DOG'S HAD A COUPLE OF YOUR PLUMS. THIS'LL DO FINE, VICAR. - WHY ARE WE STOPPING HERE? - I PROMISED OUR RALPHIE. - OH. - OH. WE MUST DO THIS MORE OFTEN. IT'S EASIER HELPING OUR RALPHIE MOVE SOMETHING. THEIR RALPHIE'S ALWAYS WANTING HIM TO MOVE SOMETHING. LIKE AN ARM, POSSIBLY. WHAT ABOUT MY CAR? WHAT ABOUT MY PICNIC? WHAT ABOUT MY DADDY? CAN YOU GIVE US A LIFT WITH THIS STUFF, SOMEBODY? I'LL GO. HERE, REV, JUST GET ON THIS END, WILL YOU? - BYE, JILL. - BYE. HEY, LIZ, THAT LOOKS A BIT DODGEY. ( dog barking ) I THOUGHT HYACINTH SAID SHE WAS GOING FOR A PICNIC. LOOKS AS IF THEY'RE PREPARED FOR EVERY CONTINGENCY. ( horn honks ) ( dog barking ) ( theme music playing ) I HEARD A NOISE. - THERE'S NO ONE THERE. ARE YOU SURE EVERYTHING'S LOCKED? - EVERYTHING'S LOCKED, BOLTED, BARRED. - HAVE YOU CHECKED THE WINDOWS? I CHECKED THE WINDOWS. WHAT ABOUT THE GARAGE? YES, IT'S STILL THERE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'VE NEVER BEEN BURGLED. IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE SOME VERY VALUABLE OBJETS D'ART. OBJETS D'ART? MY ROYAL DOULTON... - OH, THAT. AND THE FIGURINES THAT WERE GRANDMAMA'S. OH, YES, THOSE. THE WILKINSONS WERE BURGLED. ON HIS INCOME, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD AFFORD TO BE BURGLED. QUITE HONESTLY, IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES, I THINK IT'S A MITE PRETENTIOUS OF THEM TO BE BURGLED. ONE DAY THEY'LL BE SHERIDAN'S. THE WILKINSONS? DON'T BE SILLY, DEAR, MY OBJETS D'ART. - OH. HYACINTH? - HMM? I THINK SOMETIME WE OUGHT TO HAVE A TALK ABOUT SHERIDAN. OH, YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT SHERIDAN. YES, I DO KNOW. BUT NOT THAT KIND OF TALK, SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS. - WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN? WELL, WE PUT HIM TO HIGHER EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU WANTED HIM TO BE A QUANTITY SURVEYOR. - MMM-HMMM. SO WHY HAS HE DROPPED MATHS, IN FAVOR OF NEEDLEWORK? BECAUSE HE'S STARTED TO MAKE ALL HIS OWN CLOTHES, THAT'S WHY. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT HIM? I WORRY ABOUT ALL MY FAMILY, RICHARD. I WORRY ABOUT DADDY. AM I NEGLECTING HIM? WE OUGHT TO TAKE HIM OUT MORE. DO YOU THINK HE'D NOTICE? IT'S MY DUTY. GOOD NIGHT, RICHARD. GOOD NIGHT, HYACINTH. SOMEWHERE OUTDOORS- WE'LL TAKE DADDY SOMEWHERE OUTDOORS FOR A PICNIC. IT'S 1:00 IN THE MORNING! I DON'T MEAN NOW, DEAR, I MEAN TOMORROW, WHEN YOU HAVE THE DAY OFF. WE'LL TAKE DADDY SOMEWHERE NICE IN THE COUNTRY FOR A PICNIC. I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE. IT'S IDEAL FOR DADDY, A PICNIC. HE CAN DROP AS MANY CRUMBS AS HE LIKES. I'LL RING DAISY IN THE MORNING AND TELL HER TO GET HIM READY. CAN WE GO TO SLEEP NOW? YES, OF COURSE, DEAR. IT'S BEEN PREYING ON MY MIND. I MUSTN'T NEGLECT DADDY BECAUSE HE'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT. I KNOW MY DUTY. I TRUST I SHALL ALWAYS BE A CARING DAUGHTER. GOOD NIGHT, RICHARD. WHY DON'T WE MAKE A LIST? WHAT? - OF DADDY'S FAVORITE SNACKS. COME ON, DEAR. AND WHAT CAN I WEAR THAT WON'T SPOIL IF IT'S SPLASHED OR DRIBBLED ON? YOU SWINE, I TOLD YOU I NEVER WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. OH, IT'S YOU, HYACINTH. NO, I WAS EXPECTING A CALL FROM A MR. BUTTERFIELD. DADDY? YES, YES WE CAN GET HIM READY. A PICNIC? OH, I THINK THAT'S A LOVELY IDEA. NOW GET OFF THE PHONE! WHAT'S THE MATTER? IT'S ROSE. SHE WAS VERY RUDE. DO YOU THINK SHE'S EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED AGAIN? ROSE IS ALWAYS EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED. SHE WAS VERY EXCITABLE. OH, SHE'LL GET OVER IT. SHE ALWAYS DOES. SHE MENTIONED A GENTLEMAN'S NAME- BUTTERFIELD. NOW THE ONLY BUTTERFIELDS I KNOW ARE THE QUALITY CAR PEOPLE. THAT RATHER PRESTIGIOUS SHOWROOM WITH THE LEATHER FURNITURE. IT'S PROBABLY NOT THOSE BUTTERFIELDS AT ALL. OH, I BELIEVE IT IS. AND I THINK IT'S THE REAL THING THIS TIME- YOU CAN TELL IN HER VOICE. I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE HER IN HAND. THE BENEFIT OF MY EXPERIENCE COULD CONSIDERABLY AID HER SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT. WHERE'S YOUR TIE, RICHARD? - HMM? YOUR TIE, DEAR? WELL, I THOUGHT SINCE WE WERE GOING ON A PICNIC- RICHARD. MY SISTER ROSE, MRS. BUTTERFIELD. MY SISTER ROSE BUTTERFIELD. YOU'VE MET MY SISTER ROSE, MRS. BUTTERFIELD? YOU KNOW, THE EXECUTIVE CAR PEOPLE. HAS SHE ASKED HIM IF HE WANTS TO GO ON A PICNIC? I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE CAN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE'S BEEN QUIET FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS. I NOTICED THAT. I THOUGHT HE MUST BE DEAD. HAS ANYBODY CHECKED? THAT'S NOT FUNNY, ONSLOW. I KNOW- TERRIBLE THING IS A PICNIC. WHERE ARE THEY GOING ON THIS PICNIC? OH, I DON'T KNOW, AND I CAN'T STAND HERE GABBING ABOUT IT. I'M EXPECTING A CALL FROM MR. BUTTERFIELD. IT'S ALL RIGHT SAYING, "GET HIM READY." GETTING HIM READY FOR OUR HYACINTH, THAT'S REALLY GETTING HIM READY. DOES SHE MEAN I'VE GOT TO DO SANDWICHES? YOUR HYACINTH WILL NEVER BE SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH ONE OF YOUR SANDWICHES. NOW ME, FOR INSTANCE, THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER. I COULD JUST MURDER A BACON BUTTIE. WELL, YOU'VE HAD IT! I'VE GOT TO GET FATHER READY. OH, NICE. IS THIS TIE ALL RIGHT? YES, THAT'S FINE, DEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHICH GLASSES TO TAKE. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING PRESENTABLE IN CASE WE'RE OVERLOOKED. WE SHAN'T BE OVERLOOKED IF WE FIND SOMEWHERE QUIET. I'LL TAKE THESE. THESE WON'T LET US DOWN. CAN YOUR FATHER HANDLE A GLASS? - HMM? OH, DADDY CAN HAVE A BEAKER. BUT I'LL TAKE A GLASS AS WELL, IN CASE THERE ARE PASSERS-BY. I'M NOT HAVING RUMORS CIRCULATING THAT DADDY DRINKS OUT OF A BEAKER. I'LL ANSWER THAT, DEAR, YOU FINISH PACKING THE GLASSES SAFELY. NOW DO YOU LIKE THE TIE? THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE, THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING. OH, IT MUST BE SHERIDAN. YES, OF COURSE WE'LL ACCEPT THE CHARGE. SHERIDAN, HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU TO RING MOMMY, DEAR. IT'S SHERIDAN! WHAT DOES HE WANT? I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WANTS ANYTHING, DEAR. IT'S A PERSONAL, THOUGHTFUL LITTLE CALL TO HIS MOMMY. YOU NEED WHAT, SHERIDAN? SOME PAJAMAS? WELL, I DON'T SEE WHY NOT. NOW YOU SURELY CAN'T BEGRUDGE THE BOY A PAIR OF PAJAMAS. DADDY SAYS OF COURSE YOU MAY HAVE SOME NEW PAJAMAS. I'LL GET SOME AND SEND THEM ON TO YOU. OH, YOU'VE SEEN SOME THAT YOU LIKE? WELL, YES, IT'S NO PROBLEM. WE COULD SEND THE MONEY INSTEAD. HOW MUCH? WOULD YOU REPEAT THAT, SHERIDAN? I THINK I MISHEARD, DEAR. NO, I DIDN'T MISHEAR. BUT WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE PURE SILK? YOUR FRIEND TARQUIN ONLY WEARS PURE SILK PAJAMAS. I SEE. NO, OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT OUT. GOODBYE, DEAR. HYACINTH- - I THINK IT'S SPLENDID THAT SHERIDAN IS MIXING WITH SUCH A NICE CLASS OF PERSON. NOW, I'VE GOT TO GET THESE... YOU CAN'T COME IN! I'M EXPECTING A PERSONAL TELEPHONE CALL! GOOD. IF THERE'S NOTHING ON THE TELLY, I CAN LISTEN TO YOU. DON'T BE A SWINE, ONSLOW. I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD START CHANGING THE HABITS OF A LIFETIME. WHERE'S DADDY'S BROWN SHOES? HAVE YOU SEEN HIS BROWN SHOES? NO GOOD ASKING ME, I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND. OOOH. OH! I WAS LOOKING FOR THAT. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN CRUSHING MY GIRDLE? OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I'D SAY I HAVEN'T. NOT FOR A WHILE. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE BEING SO SNIFFY ABOUT A PAIR OF PAJAMAS. AT THAT PRICE? IF HE'S MIXING IN THE BETTER CIRCLES, I WILL NOT HAVE MY SHERIDAN LOOKING LIKE A POOR RELATION. ARE YOU THERE, ELIZABETH? THERE'S NO ONE THERE. YOU GIVE UP TOO EASILY. IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT ME, IT'S THAT I GIVE UP TOO EASILY. DID YOU WANT ME, HYACINTH? IN VIEW OF THE WILKINSONS' BURGLARY, I THOUGHT IT BEST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE POPPING OUT FOR AN HOUR OR TWO. I'M TAKING DADDY ON A PICNIC. OH, THAT'S NICE. A LITTLE FRESH AIR WILL DO HIM GOOD. YES, I'M SURE IT WILL. I'VE JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO SHERIDAN. HE THINKS IT'S A GOOD IDEA, TOO. HE'S SUCH A THOUGHTFUL BOY. IS SHERIDAN WELL? - WELL ENOUGH TO BE BUYING SILK PAJAMAS. ANYTHING COARSER IRRITATES. HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SOFT SKINNED. HE TAKES AFTER ME, I'M AFRAID. MIND THE OLD LADY ON THE PAVEMENT. I'M NOT GOING ON THE PAVEMENT. SUPPOSING SHE SUDDENLY LEAPS OFF? HOW MANY OLD LADIES DO MAKE SUDDEN LEAPS? AND THERE'S A CYCLIST. I CAN SEE HIM. TURN RIGHT HERE, DEAR. RIGHT? YOUR SISTER'S IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. WE'LL CALL FOR PETROL. WE CAN CALL SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY TO DAISY'S. NO, WE'LL CALL SOMEWHERE THIS WAY. WHY? OH, I SEE WHY. WE'LL FILL UP HERE. IF ROSE IS GOING TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE FAMILY, WE MIGHT AS WELL START USING HERE. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S THE SAME BUTTERFIELD. HOW MANY BUTTERFIELDS DO YOU THINK THERE ARE IN A SMALL TOWN? ARE YOU PLANNING TO FILL IT YOURSELF? IT'S SELF SERVICE. WELL, NOT FOR THOSE CONNECTED WITH THE FAMILY, SURELY. LOOK, LET'S NOT MAKE A FUSS. OH, VERY WELL. HELLO? IT'S FOR YOU. IT'S YOUR COUSIN RALPHIE. HIYA, KID. AND DON'T HOG THE PHONE, I'M EXPECTING A CALL FROM MR. BUTTERFIELD. WELL, I'M FAIRLY BUSY, RALPHIE, PLUS, IT'S NOT EASY GETTING OUT FROM UNDER THIS DOG. HAS IT GOT TO BE GONE TODAY? I HAVEN'T GOT A ROOF RACK. WELL, HOW HEAVY IS IT? WELL, HE'S READY. I MEAN, FOR ME HE'S READY, WHETHER HE'S READY FOR OUR HYACINTH, WE'LL FIND OUT. WILL YOU GET ONSLOW OFF THE PHONE WITH THEIR RALPHIE? WHAT'S RALPHIE WANT? STUFFING. BRING A BUTTERFIELD HERE. WE SHOULD ARRANGE A LITTLE MEETING AT HOME. I COULD SURROUND HIM WITH COFFEE AND PETITS FOURS AND YOU COULD TALK TO HIM INTELLIGENTLY. PERHAPS YOU OUT TO START BRUSHING UP YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON THE PROBLEMS OF THE LUXURY CARRIAGE TRADE. THAT SOUNDS FUN. IT'S THE DUSTBIN MEN I FEEL SORRY FOR. I MEAN, HOW CAN THEY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE AND WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO STAY? LEAVE IT, LEAVE IT. IS DADDY READY? - HE'S READY. DADDY, IT'S HYACINTH, DEAR. NO DON'T GET UNDER THE BED. AT LEAST I HOPE HE'S READY. HASN'T HE GOT A TIE? FOR A PICNIC? JUST BECAUSE IT'S AL FRESCO, IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ANY THE LESS A SOCIAL OCCASION. I'LL GET A TIE. THE CAR'S OUTSIDE, DADDY, BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT. I JUST HAVE TO HAVE A WORD WITH ROSE. NO, NO, I TOLD YOU THAT I HAVEN'T GOT YOUR BALL. RICHARD, DO STOP PLAYING WITH THAT ANIMAL. NO, YOU'RE A LOUSE. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LOUSE. AND WHAT'S MORE YOU'VE GOT HAIRY TOES. YOU'RE THE FIRST MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN WITH HAIRY TOES, TED BUTTERFIELD, AND IT LOOKS LIKE A BAD SIGN- ROSE, YOU CANNOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO A BUTTERFIELD! GOOD GRACIOUS, GIRL, THINK OF THE BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD. BRIGHT FUTURE? DO YOU KNOW THE BUTTERFIELDS? OF COURSE WE KNOW THE BUTTERFIELDS, WE'VE JUST BEEN THERE. MY SISTER WON'T KEEP YOU A MOMENT, MR. BUTTERFIELD. WE CALL REGULARLY AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS. - WHAT PLACE OF BUSINESS? MY SISTER'S STANDING HERE IN THE GRIP OF A VERY POWERFUL EMOTION. YOU MUSTN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HER HARSH WORDS. IT'S JUST A CRUST THAT SHE'S HAD TO DEVELOP TO COVER HER PURITY AND SIMPLICITY. WE'RE LIKE THAT AS A FAMILY, HIGHER STANDARDS PREVAIL. MY SON WEARS PURE SILK PAJAMAS. ROSE, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BEHAVE IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE TOWN'S LEADING COMMERCIAL FAMILIES. WHAT COMMERCIAL FAMILY? THE EXECUTIVE MOTOR SHOWROOM, THE GARAGE, THEIR FORECOURT SERVICE IS UNPARALLELED. HE'S NOT THAT BUTTERFIELD. THIS ONE'S A TOTAL DREK WITHOUT A PENNY TO HIS NAME. HMM? AND FURTHERMORE, WILL YOU KINDLY STOP BOTHERING MY SISTER? ! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THAT FOR? I LOVE HIM! - HOW CAN YOU LOVE HIM? THE MAN HAS HAIRY TOES. NOW, THAT'S A MUCH SMARTER DADDY WITH THE TIE. WAIT THERE UNTIL WE FETCH YOU. AND DON'T DISARRANGE YOURSELF. HAS HE GOT A HANDKERCHIEF? - ONE OF ONSLOW'S. IS IT CLEAN? IT'S CLEAN! WHERE IS ONSLOW? I SUPPOSE HE'S STILL IN BED. HE'S NOT STILL IN BED. HE'S GONE TO BORROW A ROOF RACK. WHAT FOR? - HE'S GOT TO HELP THEIR RALPHIE MOVE SOMETHING. WHATEVER NEXT? IF SOMEONE C-WOULD-? IF ANYBODY'S LISTENING, I'M UNDER HERE. RICHARD, I TOLD YOU TO STOP PLAYING WITH THAT DOG. I DON'T WANT HAIRS ALL OVER OUR OLD SOFA. DAISY, AS WELL AS A HANDKERCHIEF I THINK DADDY OUGHT TO HAVE A SMALL TOWEL- CLEANTOWEL. OH, LOOK AT YOUR CLOTHES. YOU'RE COVERED IN HAIRS. THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT. FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR I'VE BEEN COVERED IN DOG. WHERE IS EVERYBODY WHEN YOU NEED THEM? ONSLOW'S GONE BORROWING A ROOF RACK, AND THEN HE'S OFF ON SOME APPALLING UNSTYLISH ERRAND FOR THEIR "RAFE." OH NICE. OH, NO. THERE GOES DADDY WITH MY TUNA MAYONNAISE. - AND MY CAR. WELL, WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING HIM? I WAS IN THE KITCHEN. I WAS UNDER THE DOG. IMPULSIVE DADDY. I HOPE HE'S NOT GOING TO DRIVE AT SPEEDS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MY CUT-GLASS CONDIMENT SET. IN MY CAR! HOW ARE WE GOING TO CATCH UP WITH HIM? WE'LL HAVE TO GO IN MINE. WHAT TIME IS JILL EXPECTING US? ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, LIZ. WATCH THE- OH NO! WASN'T THAT RICHARD'S CAR? I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT WAS RICHARD'S CAR. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE DAMN FOOL BEHIND THE WHEEL WAS, ALL I COULD SEE WAS A CAP. A CAR BEING DRIVEN BY A CAP. WHOA! THERE GOES MY ROOF-RACK! HE'S GETTING AWAY! HE'S GOT A NEWER CAR, HASN'T HE? LET'S HOPE HE KEEPS IT THAT WAY. HE'LL SLOW DOWN IN A BIT. WHY SHOULD HE SLOW DOWN? BECAUSE HE GETS TIRED. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE- HE HAS BURSTS OF ENERGY AND THEN HE GOES TO SLEEP. BEHIND THE WHEEL? THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING. OH, MY POOR DADDY. - OH, MY POOR CAR! HE DOES. HE COULD BE TALKING TO A PERSON AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SENTENCE, "WHALLOP," HE'S ASLEEP. HE'S SLOWING DOWN. I TOLD YOU. HE'S FEELING TIRED. CAN'T YOU OVERTAKE HIM? ON WHICH SIDE? OH, POOR DADDY, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL OF A STRANGE CAR. IT'S NOT THE CAR THAT'S STRANGE, IT'S YOUR FATHER. I SHOULD BE WITH HIM IN HIS HOUR OF DANGER. HE MIGHT HAVE AN ACCIDENT. I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF HIM LYING INJURED, HIS DEAR BALD HEAD COVERED IN MY TUNA MAYONNAISE. OH, NO! I THINK MY GASKET'S GONE. I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN YOU WERE CHAPLAIN OF A PRISON. WELL, I DIDN'T. I WAS BEGINNING TO SPEAK OUT OF THE SIDE OF MY MOUTH. IT'S A FRIENDLY PARISH HERE. SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE TOO FRIENDLY. NOW, THAT WAS AN EVIL THOUGHT. Daisy: THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE. OH, DAMN, IT'S THE BUCKET WOMAN! SHOULD YOU BE SAYING "DAMN" LIKE THAT? - NOT NORMALLY, NO. I'M TURNING ROUND. YOU CAN'T TURN ROUND, YOU HAVE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE. OH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. DAMN, IT'S THE VAMPIRE SISTER! YOU WERE RIGHT, TURN ROUND! TURN ROUND! I CAN'T TURN ROUND NOW, THEY'VE SEEN US. MAY I BE OF ANY HELP? THAT'S VERY, VERY KIND OF YOU, VICAR. PERHAPS YOU COULD GIVE US A LIFT? IT'S NOT OUR CAR, OF COURSE, WE'RE JUST HERE ON CHARITABLE PURPOSES. ROOM FOR A COUPLE. - THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, VICAR. THANK YOU, VICAR. - THANK YOU, VICAR. TA, VICAR. Richard: OH, NO. - DOWN, GIRL. I DO THINK HE'S GOT LOVELY HAIR FOR A VICAR. I CAN'T THINK HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I LAST SAT ON YOUR LAP, ONSLOW. IT MAKES YOUR EYES WATER, I KNOW THAT. HOW FARES THE CHURCH WORLDWIDE THEN, VICAR? FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT IS THE MISSIONARY POSITION IN CHINA THESE DAYS? I THINK THAT DOG'S HAD A COUPLE OF YOUR PLUMS. THIS'LL DO FINE, VICAR. WHY ARE WE STOPPING HERE? - I PROMISED OUR RALPHIE. OH. - OH. WE MUST DO THIS MORE OFTEN. IT'S EASIER HELPING OUR RALPHIE MOVE SOMETHING. THEIR RALPHIE'S ALWAYS WANTING HIM TO MOVE SOMETHING. LIKE AN ARM, POSSIBLY. WHAT ABOUT MY CAR? WHAT ABOUT MY PICNIC? WHAT ABOUT MY DADDY? CAN YOU GIVE US A LIFT WITH THIS STUFF, SOMEBODY? I'LL GO. HERE, REV, JUST GET ON THIS END, WILL YOU? BYE, JILL. - BYE. HEY, LIZ, THAT LOOKS A BIT DODGEY. I THOUGHT HYACINTH SAID SHE WAS GOING FOR A PICNIC. LOOKS AS IF THEY'RE PREPARED FOR EVERY CONTINGENCY. At least the weather here in Cornwall is better than the news. Maybe Michael Heseltine's report on conditions in Liverpool will bring some hope to that riot-torn city. Then again, pigs might fly. Imperial has announced a packet of 20 Embassy is going up 3p to 95 pence. Life is so bad, even the Moonies are deserting us, but the new line-up on TV looks promising though, especially Thames new season, headlined by Waugh's Brideshead Revisited. Hey, watch out! Be careful. I told you it wouldn't work, anyway. Look what you've done. Why does he have to come? I've asked you 100 times. Daddy can help you, can't he? Look, Daddy is an economist, he's not a sociologist. He doesn't understand anything about my work. Swim. - Only if you come. - No, I don't want to. - Please. - Listen, Rachel, I'll watch you from here. - You can swim by yourself. - I don't like it. - Yes, you do. - I only like it when you come. All right. Jump! Yeah! Ripped By mstoll Snap. All we're missing is the Rachmaninov. - Is it all right if I kiss you? - Of course. I mean, there's no-one about, or anything? Well... So tell me about the people we're staying with. I've already told you. Sally was brought up with me in Sidcup. Eric is her husband. Every conversation I have is with you, you know. Every night, I take you to bed in my arms, truly. Why don't you pull over when you can? What is it? What did you tell your wife? I'm at a conference. Delivering a paper? - It has nothing to do with you. - Yes, it has. Look, I want to make love to you. I thought you wanted to. If you don't, then... Come here. There is a problem. What? Well, it's not really a problem, it's just I couldn't do anything else, really. What? Rachel's here. - I don't believe you. - Look... I couldn't exactly force her to spend a holiday in the Lakes with her father and brothers, could I? Anyway, it isn't really a problem. She does go to bed early and... - Yeah. ...she usually sleeps through. And it would've looked very strange if I hadn't brought her. Yeah. I've never done this sort of thing before. - I know you've got it down to a fine art. - That's not fair. Look, I know you know I've been to bed with lots of women and some of them were friends and some of them were nothing, but this... is different. You're different. Remember what we promised? I'd never phone you at home? No. Yeah, the other one. You'd never lie to me. I'll never lie to you, that one. - Mark, this is Sally. Sally, Mark. - Hello. How do you do? Thank you for letting me come. - Rachel is helping Eric with the barbecue. - Great. - I'll show you to your room, shall I? - Yeah, thanks. - Where is it? - There. No, no, it's over there. It's blown over there. Can you go and get it for me? I'll count to 10, see if you can get it back to me by the time I count to 10, OK. So one, two... Hurry up. ...four, five... Have you got it? - Yeah. Yeah? Right, bring it back... five, six, seven. Well done. Brilliant. Would you like a sausage? Do you like sausages? Great, you've got the wine. Last time I felt like this, I broke out in hives. Don't worry. He obviously has everything under control. You don't like him. I've been to bed with too many like him so, if you take my advice, worked out over years of sobbing with Mars Bars and Woman's Own in a bar don't expect to change him. Sally, I learned that when I was about 16 years old. No, that's when we were told it. I don't know any woman who actually believes it. I think the species would probably die out. But you, my dear, have landed yourself the classic middle-aged specimen. - Are you drunk? - No. I'm nervous for you. You've been off the market too long. I've never been on the market. Well, be prepared because soon, when you're naked and immolated, he'll announce his wife expects him home for supper. I'm sorry, that was a terrible thing to say. It's wanting to make babies and not managing it, it makes me dreadful. No, thank you. Anyway, the sex is bound to be great. - Hurry up. - Just don't confuse it with love. What if I already have? How can I go on living with James, if I already have? Da-dah! Here we are, then. - Come on. - Lovely. - Great. - Bring that bottle. - Is she all right with that? - She's fine, don't worry. - Here we are. Take that, Sally. - There you are. - You can have some Coca-Cola. - I'm going to have a glass of wine. - Is that all you've done? - There's plenty more down there. - Eric, this is Mark. - How do you do? - Hello. Pleased to meet you. - And you. And this must be Rachel. Hello. Say hello, darling. - So how's it all going? - I'm just glad I'm not giving a paper. - But you're all all right, aren't you? - Yes. Yes, we're all fine. - Good. OK. - I've got an estimate for the roof. I must go. I want to try and catch Harrison, before he disappears for the night. - All right. I'll try... - And don't worry if I don't call tomorrow, OK? - Take care. - Yeah. - And kiss the girls. OK. - Yeah, I will. - Miss you. - Yeah. - Bye-bye. - I love you. Was that your wife? It's time for bed, isn't it? Do you have any children? Two girls, but they're older than you. You should have brought them with you. Yes, well... Shall we try and find your mummy? So do you think you'll chick... Do I look like I'm laughing? Do I look that comical to you? Dammit! Good-for-nothing loser. Dishy, he wants you. You libertines climb such heights to play a joke on a humble girl. I worry that you will not be content with me. I'm afraid that my lowly body cannot satisfy your desires forged in paradise. What a turn on. I bet she tastes good. She looks ripe. Let's pluck her. Boss! What's wrong? Scared? Hold on! We've made yourselves too excited on such a pleasant day. My servants will inform you when we'll meet again. Get out of my sight! Come on, you had a good time. Asking for a woman in our world is no different from declaring war! Then is Dishy Man-deuk's girl? Are you asking because you don't know? I thought you said gang stuff and fighting was your day job? Then go ahead and fight! Mapo district won't be safe anymore. Odd Ears! What the? Boss! Did I tell you to go? Hey, Bong-dal! That mother fucker seemed like a Bunco. That mother fucker! How could that fucker! Hit on your girl? You sons of bitches! Shut your dame mouths! Who are you to tell me that mother fucker! Fucker... Shut up, you Basterds! What the fuck does Odd Ears want? Odd Ears! Boss, please open your eyes. What is this slap in the face? What will happen to Yangjoo if you leave me alone with that bird-brained good-for-nothing? Boss, please say something. Do I have to trust in him? To hell with this! Why don't you tell the whole town that Thunder is a scoundrel! Am I a good-for-nothing? Fine, I'm a good-for-nothing! No, Thunder is considered a loyal, good-hearted fighter of Mapo district. Bong-dal, don't you have anything to say? Damn it, do you think I like this pantomime? Why don't you just leave me out of this farce! Step outside, you ungrateful houseboy. Let's put an end to everything. I said step outside, you bootlicker! I said step outside! Let's fight, you brown-noser! Hit me! Come on! Go ahead and hit me. Didn't you order me to step outside, Boss? What? I don't believe this. Odd Ears' men didn't seem so weak to me. Then fight them, what's the problem? Economics is the issue. I think Man-deuk has sided with a high official to pay people off, and he's given Man-deuk the license to distribute alcohol nationwide. The groups in support of Odd Ears may turn on us any day. Do you know Thunder? He's just a passing wind in the night. A passing wind, you say... All bark and no bite. I have no memory of him. You're quite good with words. Do you like cockscomb flowers? The most vivid flowers in nature... I've caught him! But they flourish like weeds... He's an informer in the Mapo market. Cyclops! Big Head! Furnace! Hey, big mouth. Do you know Thunder? Of course! I've known him since he was a baby. It was March 3rd of... You idiot. Just answer 'yes' or 'no' to the question. Yes. Do you know Odd Ears? Yes. How do Odd Ears and Thunder know each other? Can I tell you the long version? When I talk, you see, I need to explain the details. Do as you like. It's getting late. I already made your bed. We never sleep. It might rain. Please let us just love one another! Go ahead and love. Both of them are crazy. Do you have a reservation? I don't. - Excuse me. - Mommy! Dishy? You're not Dishy. Be quiet. Damn it. What are you doing here, you lunatic? Dishy! I had a tough time getting here. Smile for me, why don't you. A lowlife like you can't come in here. Leave before I scream for help. Come on, at least we can be together for one night. - You wouldn't. - Over here! Are you crazy? I came here to give you something. I just can't get rid of you. Yeah, I knew you'd like it. Look here! Okay, okay. I'll just go so don't scream. Bye. My god... Over there! Catch him! It's you! Rumors are everywhere. About what? That you're going to fight Man-deuk. What? But that's not true. Anyway, be careful. That's my advice as a friend. A friend? Hey, wait right there! Scallywag. Have you been stuffing your face? I didn't eat a thing, dammit! Where have you been? I just went to check out the enemy's movements. Boss, the whole Yangjoo family is depending on you. No matter what people say, we're a gang that takes care of its people. It's not that much different from governing a country. And compared to that, a mere chick... If you say 'chick' one more time, you'd better watch out. I'm sorry, sir. We cannot risk the gang's future over one woman. On top of which, she's only a courtesan. A courtesan is a flower that one must not love. Dammit, then what do you expect me to do? I've already fallen in love. Dammit. Give me just one day to plan! Then I'll arrange a meeting with Dishy. Really? This is Dishy's schedule. Strip. She'll wake up at 5am to prepare for a courtesan initiation ceremony at 11am. Our operation begins here! Four or five noble libertines will gather to go on a boat trip. Turn around. This is our operations map. Dishy will follow this road. We will be here. What? Feel any pain? No, sir. Expand the map. We follow this road and hide here. We intercept Dishy's route right here. We instigate an accident at this commonly congested area. After we kidnap one of the libertines... Let's have some fun. I must discover whether or not you're really a courtesan. Who is your benefactor? I don't know his name yet. You don't know his name? So does that mean you have someone in mind? Yes, there is someone deep in my heart. All the best libertines are here, so you can forget about him. I've already fallen in love. Love? - Where is it? - Where exactly? Deep inside me. Let's see! Is your love here? Throw it away! It's deeper. Is your love here? Throw this away, too! Now for some excitement! Let's have the background music! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! Take it all off! Take it off! You bunch of dirty scoundrels! They're acting like crazy men out there. Just ignore them. I have my hands full. Nowhere to hide under the open sky or upon the ocean, so with this... Untie their ropes. I said untie the ropes! Are you cold? Yes! Shut up, you rogue. Hey, Dishy. Do you want to marry me right here? What? Don't you trust me? Has your brain gone soft from fighting or were you born stupid? You don't get what I'm saying? You're resisting me on purpose, aren't you? I'll say it once again. Don't get in my way. I don't want to put up with someone like you. Why? Because I'm a lowlife? So you know yourself well then. Hey! Then why are you carrying this with you? - Why would she carry this everywhere? - Jerk. You like me, don't you? Satisfied? Now get out of my face. Untie them! I'm out of here! Hey! Thunder! Thunder! Bye! You better trail them. How about we just kill them! Have fun on the boat? The water was a little cold. Hey, Chil-gap. Relax, I'm here alone. Can I call you my friend, Thunder? I didn't spend much time in school, so I don't have many friends, Man-deuk. How valiant. I feel all-powerful before I sleep with her, but I feel forlorn after I sleep with her. I'll give you Dishy. But I want Odd Ears in exchange. It's 10,000 in coins. You won't be disappointed. To hell with it. Oh boy. Sounds like a lot. You guys definitely play the game at a different level. Fine, it worked out. I wasn't really interested in your fight anyway. But you know what my mother always told me? She said to treat customers like gods. Whether they've come for a single drink or a whole bowl of soup, treat them like gods. Man-deuk, I'm really grateful. Now for the first time I understand what she meant. I don't know what kind of person Odd Ears is, but he's sleeping in my house, just like a god. And how can I give up a god, huh? Man-deuk, come swing by my place. I'll serve you like a god too. A lot of snow will fall this winter. Too bad you won't get to see it. Then let's fight on the first day of snow this winter. Think I'm scared? Visit your mom's cheap grave before the first snow falls. What, you spineless dog? Boss! Come here, you twisted degenerate! Be patient, boss! That damn rat! Why the hell is he so worried about Odd Ears? When Man-deuk's gang steps outside their own territory, They can't compete with Odd Ears' power and money. Stone head! Show it to him. Eleven salt warehouses, five icehouses, twenty-one grain warehouses, and two gold storerooms. If you cash them all in, it's about 1,500 coins worth. So I'm getting into a fight over 1,500 coins worth of property? It may be hard to believe, but yes. Oh no. Why don't you taste it too? Yes, sir. My son was one of the men humiliated by Odd Ears' gang on the river. Do you know what kind of person my son is? He's the only son to continue my family line. You better understand why I picked you over Odd Ears. Shall I taste it? You idiot. Twin orchids. 'Two hearts', 'Two convictions' 'The love between two people... shall be understood by them only.' I know that much. I see that you like to fight. I like fights too. Think you're ready to fight us? Did your men get scared and run away? You don't fight with numbers, you fight with your brain, idiot. Just throw in the towel. Why are you so calm? We're the Yangjoo Gang. Have you eaten yet, sir? This is Thunder! Boss! First row, protect Odd Ears! Yes, sir. To your positions! No weapons. No biting. No spitting. No eye-poking. No cursing. - Oh, come on. - How can we not curse? - Let's curse. - Yeah. Okay, sir. Anyway, a fare fight to the end, okay? - Okay. - Of course. Miscreants. - You're all dead meat. - You're gonna die. How dare you swing your piggie legs at me? Go and stuff your face with pigs' trotters at home! Do I look like a pushover to you? Do I look like a pushover, you weakling! You cheaters! Why are you hold my leg! Come on! You sons of bitches! The Big Head who can make three generations bulging head! Furnace! Crush his testicles! That's going too far. Furnace! Big Head! You son of unwed parents! No! Stop! The little birds! Let's take a break. Everyone, timeout! Boss, how is your fist? Don't even ask. You grabbed my goddamn balls! Not bad, it's been a while since I've feared for my life. You guys aren't so bad after all! It would've been great if you'd ruled the world with Man-deuk. This here is my world, you numbskulls! - Shall we continue the fight? - Absolutely. Are you up to it? Watch their legs. You can see it all if you just observe their legs. Fight! Attack! Boss! Boss! Some scum named Chun-soo had a knife and Odd Ear... Hurry! Quickly! You bastards! Lowest of the low. What? A knife? What do you want? Who are you? Try and get past me! You crazy bitch... Swines. Boss! Whoever messes with this gentleman will die! You filthy trash. I really didn't know. Please forgive me. I really didn't know. Dammit. Don't ever come into Mapo again, got it? Yeah. Get lost. Get out of here! You call yourselves Yangjoo gangsters? After screwing up like this? If you can't risk your life to protect your boss, then die by my hands or leave the gang. Let go. They're useless. Chil-gap. Mo-jil, Bong-pal, and ll-seok, it's not their fault. I don't know how it is in your world, but these guys... are no different from Odd Ears. Dammit. It's a war, Boss. A war? Man-deuk, that scumbag. Is this Man-deuk's brewery? Boss, not here. What, are you chicken? If you attack the brewery, it will be an unavoidable all-out-war. You do it your way. I'll do it my way. Smash them all. Yes, sir! Dammit. I guess we can't deal with it quietly now. You imbecile. Furnace, Big Head, Cyclops. Where the hell are they? Are they plotting something behind my back? And who the hell is that wretched thug? Is Excellency Song plotting with them? Excellency Song has arrived. What the hell is happening? I have a good idea. What idea can you have in that tiny brain of yours? I'll do the thinking. I told you to clean out the trash that stands in my way. You dumb idiot. Dammit. Come here. Come here, you harpy. Let me see your face. Come here. You, come here. Come here and let me smell you. You sluts. How dare you run away when I'm calling you? Come here, you trollop. Let's have some fun. You hussy. Me, Man-deuk! I was born with nothing, and struggled through hell. Yes, I am Man-deuk! I came this far to be who I am today! Do I look defeated to you? Do I look pitiful to you? You've drank a lot, sir. Please bring this useless fight to an end. You should be begging me to save Thunder, right? An owner can read his dog's mind when he sees his mutt's eyes looking up at him. It's a very endearing moment. Look straight into my eyes. Am I your owner? You're a dog who would bite your owner's hand and worse. That drives me mad! Dishy, I'll ask you one more time. Who is Thunder? You ask what kind of person Thunder is? He's like a tiny grain of sand swept in by the ocean. So why are you wasting your energy on him? Like sand... Before that grain of sand goes out to sea again, I will kill him. They will definitely return. Are you scared? Chil-gap. This place may look poverty-ridden to you, but my mother lived here. My mother... Dammit. If you want to leave me, then take Odd Ears with you and go. No, Boss. Is there something wrong? No. You've suffered greatly because of me. Where is Odd Ears? He came like the wind and disappeared like... Keep it short. He's in Mapo district. Sir, welcome back! Your Excellency, please heed my words. There are rumors that the nation's gangs are plotting treason. Please make the order to arrest them at once. Is that such an easy thing to do? There are also rumors that someone in the court is supporting them. I heard your son also suffered at their hands. There are things that we should speak of and things that shouldn't be spoken. My son, are you here? Yes, Excellency. There are indeed disagreements among the gangs, but they are living within the lores of the underworld. They wouldn't go so far as to plot treason. If you start ordering arrests, I'm afraid that the government might fall into chaos over this war. I think it might be best to just stand back and wait. You're getting prettier by the day. You're getting dumber by the hour. What did I do wrong? Thunder, listen very carefully. This will be the last time we meet. No, it must be the very last. Are you that afraid of Man-deuk? Thunder! You're in deeper than you think. They will kill you. I'm not afraid of dying. Don't risk your life for me. I'm not worth it. So leave quickly. You said that I was a lowlife, right? I know I'm a worthless person. I've lived a worthless life until this day. But when I'm with you, I'm different. Trust me. As long as you're with me, as long as you trust me, I can be the best man in this world. While you're with me, while you're watching me, that's the man I want to be. That's how I want things to be. Thunder. By now, Big Gun, I mean Man-deuk... has gathered every swordsman he can and they're on their way to Mapo. What? Please forget about me and go. Did someone follow you? Hurry and go. Go! Get out of here. Dishy, run! Man-deuk, you cheating scum. You're using blades? All I need is one punch. Come and fight me, you rat. As long as you trust me, I can be the best man in this world. While you are with me, while you're watching me, that's the man I want to be. Fighting. That's something a mutt like you who lives on rotten meat can't understand. Kill me and let Thunder live. I'll be your property if that's what you want but please let Thunder live. You're just making Thunder even more pitiful. Shall I kill her and let you live? Look here, Thunder. Being the leader of a gang is like governing a country. What happened to the pack of dogs that follows you around? It's too late for you to understand. On your knees! I don't kneel before anyone who isn't my boss. Oh, really? Oh goodness. Oh goodness, Odd Ears. Oh goodness. Oh goodness, Odd Ears. What happened to you? Is this finally the end for you? Oh goodness, Odd Ears. I have a big event coming up, so I don't want to see any more blood. Everyone knows that Thunder is under my thumb now. Hand over everything Yangjoo owns by tomorrow morning. This is a final act of desperation. Oh poor you, Odd Ears. Dammit. Oh, life is so worthless. Life is so unfair. Sir, I have one request. Please let me have Thunder's body. Look at you. I will give you his shriveled remains. Bury him in a sunny place. I met Odd Ears and became a human being. I met Thunder and wanted to serve someone who could become a king. What is wrong with having a dream like that at my age? Thunder was a man even greater than that. I don't regret a thing. It must have been our destiny to come this far. After serving Odd Ears and Thunder, I am to live in silence. If it wasn't for your request, he would be dead. I won't forget your graciousness. You should never forget. You should understand now what it means to be someone's dog. The magnificent celebration will start soon. Now you will fall in love with me as well. The Yangjoo Gang will disband after today. What are you talking about? I lived happily sharing my loyalty and camaraderie with you all. But in a world of knives and corruption it is hard to maintain the way of the fist. Our boss... We couldn't protect our boss. We have nobody to depend on now. Odd Ears said that he started with only 10 coins. Let's all start a new life. Please forgive me. I have nothing to say. How can I lift my face up to the sun? Please forgive me. But... with my fists I wanted to play a role in this world. I need to finish what I started. I feel wronged and resentful. Now I understand what you've been talking about. Please give me one more chance. All the men have left, and all the keys are gone. I'm sorry. I truly am. But I will bring them back. I will bring them all back. Now I can do anything that you tell me to do. If you tell me to eat this dirt and die, I will. Boss! Boss! Please don't do this. Please help me one more time. Boss. Damn, we can't just lose like this. Boss. I will fight alongside you. So shall we. Don't you want to take control? Yes, my friend. However... you must forget about that woman. I promise with my life... that no matter what... I will take over the Bright Moon in Pil district. Post it all over the country. The Fight of All Fights Man-deuk vs. Thunder Congratulations. I'm only upset that it's a little late. Do you all also like cockscomb flowers? I like pumpkin flowers. I like cockscomb flowers. Cockscomb flowers. Cockscomb flowers are vibrant. She's too beautiful a woman for one person to possess. Then... share her with me. From today... every gang in each territory shall be disbanded to merge with the Big Gun Gang. Hurray! Big Gun! Big Gun! Man-deuk! Man-deuk! Man-deuk! The shriveled remains are here. Open the door! Boss, I'll handle the trivial stuff. Man-deuk, let's see who is really the best fighter of the land. I'll risk everything I own. Crazy lunatic! Today's celebration will also be your funeral. You shouldn't do that! Man-deuk! Hey, Man-deuk! Calling you Boss feels so sickening! Man-deuk, you dirty swine! What's happening? The whole posse is here, dummy! How dare they! Prince! I heard that there will be a great fight today so I came to watch. It's going to be a frightening match. Let's make a bet. If Man-deuk wins, I will forget your involvement. If Thunder wins, prepare for the road to death. Let's begin the fight. Heed my command! Today, it seems that many people have come to watch the fight between Thunder and Man-deuk. No man shall intervene, only the two of them shall fight today! What do you mean exactly by that? You're here too? Watch closely to learn how real men fight. The Fight of All Fights Man-deuk vs. Thunder Fine, I accept your challenge. Everyone, step aside! This is neither a legend nor a myth! It's a historic fight between the greatest fighters of the age! That's the problem! I'm so excited it's hard for me to explain! The heroes are getting into position! Now the fight finally begins! That little! You coward! You useless lowlife! Man-deuk, you traitor! It's not over yet! Get up, you coward! Coward? Dammit! Pick it up, you candy-ass. You're dead meat, you vermin. Just die won't you? I feel all-powerful before I sleep with her, but I feel forlorn after I sleep with her. You make me sick. He won! Someone write about this fight in all its detail later! Let's get out of here for now! Chil-gap, thank you. You jerk! You said you were going to protect me! But you just walk away like that? Dammit. Chil-gap! Dishy! Wait! You can't take her away so easily. Don't you have something to finish up with me? Hey, can't you see the state of my face? Let's finish this later. Hey, how about you and me fight. And the victor wins Dishy. You rascal. Okay, let's finish this right now, you wannabe. There's only one king in this land. And there's only one king of fighters. One man takes all. You'll get hurt really bad if you fool around with girls again. Come and fight me. You rascal, who the hell are you? My name isn't wench, it's Dishy. Buggers. Honey, let's go.

Presented by Showbox / Mediaplex Produced by Filmmaker RK 1942, The Soviet Embassy in Beijing Plan 1 is on. Go ahead and begin Plan 2. She's going that way! You could get caught! A thirsty dog must drink. Take the list and go! You will surely become a nameless ghost on this foreign soil. is there anything more to say? Please go, or you too will part with this sorry world! You're a good person... I wish I had you... Whether driven by virtue or vice, we all die eventually. Only the method and purpose vary. If this is fate, let it come. And we shall meet it head on. Why do I have this nagging thought that someone could break in here? Must surely be my nervous imagination. Look up at the stars in the sky. They shine at night and people hide in the darkness. Thus evil is born in the small hours of the night. Throw down the chains of betrayal and take my fist as repentance? No... this can't be happening. Heinous lies are unforgivable! But why! I couldn't help it! No excuses! Please say it isn't so! When puberty begins, one seeks the opposite gender, not friends. When one gets hot flashes and grey hair appears pursuit of happiness becomes higher priority than national security. Enough with the show! who would cast a stone at her in this hour of tragic history Codename Madam Jang was once an ordinary girl with dreams Madam Jang (Real name Sook-ja Jang) Codename Madam Jang was once an ordinary girl with dreams a bit prematurely aged however But as her family fought against Japanese occupation, she was naturally influenced by their involvement in the movement... and found herself following in their footsteps as a secret agent. 13 years as a secret agent had deprived her of her youth. She had once fallen in love... but she was already married to her country. Sook-ja was also a woman with passion coursing through her veins. Having spent years alone carrying out dangerous missions, blowing up buildings, Ah another explosion! Torturing the enemy, Ah More pain! , and killing people, it was true that she felt utterly alone when night fell. Then one day... Here comes a lonely wolf Oh, my god! Finally, he's shaking her mind! and his name is damanegi I chose passionate love, that's all. Not just a fling, or something to shield me against loneliness. So you had some innocence left in you! But you have committed treason and cheated on our country! Cheated? ! The marriage isn't even official yet! It's still common law marriage! So how does this change anything? ! You don't pick flowers that have already withered! Enough! Stop defending yourself! Just accept your sins and end your vice-laden life! Accept my fist while at it! Swallow it, and you will explode in 5 seconds, Jang Madam. It's Madam Jang, not Jang Madam. I see. Good bye, Jang Sook-ja. Where is he? Oh my gosh! Why are you so late? Because of Madam Jang? So it was true. Who would have thought she would end up like that... A beautiful rose has many thorns. The list of Japanese agents? Here. My gosh! I believe it's time to bid farewell to this place. Ready? With you, always. Tokyo, Japan Snowy Horse Good evening. Today we talk about Golden Buddha containing names of Korean agents threatening the future of the Japanese Empire. The agents on the list work all around the world to collect funds for their course. The moment we get that list, the freedom fighters and the Shanghai provisional government that have been expanding their activities down from Manchuria will take a tremendous hit and be forced to retreat. We have received the reports. But how do you propose to... get your hands on Golden Buddha? Okay, okay. Boss. How can you get the statue? Please provide basic information and expenses needed and we shall get it for you in not time. We also like Miss Myong-wor. if we give them basic information and expenses they can bring the Golden Buddha quickly and surely. And they like Miss Myung-wor. Oh, I see. I can give you the funds necessary. but do you know where the statue is? You say money is not a problem but you don't know its whereabouts? Yes, that's right. Then tell him not to worry. He says not to worry about the statue's whereabouts. How come no one's translating into Chinese? Just have the money ready and I will tell you where it is. Let's meet in Switzerland at the World Spy Conference and make the exchange in the secret bank there. to guarantee the safety of the money and the statue. Boss, let's exchange the statue and the money in Switzerland. Oh, my God! Sorry, sir, but we did our best. It's okay. I spy a fly. A pussy cat with sharp claws. How much to buy you? I won't ask for a discount. Your words are as foul as your breath. You're obviously no ordinary cat seeing as your made it this far. Why, you... You traitor! That was my mother's name. Listen, you son of a traitor. I kneel before you today... but mark my words! I shall surely tell of your treacherous acts! You leave me no choice but to zip up that cute little kitty mouth. Dooman River lt is as "moth to a flame", and "out of the pan and into the fire." This could only mean the situation's getting worse. Wouldn't "as leaves in the wind" be more appropriate? But "leaves in the wind" implies we are helpless. Leaves have no voice, but comrades are crying out to us. Then is it not illogical? Such good ears you have. There is only one thing to do. We must send him in. You don't mean...! Let me help you ma'am. Why, thank you. Oh, my back. Oops a daisy! What's happen? Oh, no! Good lord! My money's gone! Everyone! My money is gone! What shall I do! What's your fucking problem! Hand it over! You're pushing it! Testing my patience? One of us is certainly being patient. I'm afraid I lost my patience a long time ago. That's your problem. Why, you! What an idiot. You're determined to sign off your life on a speeding train! And you seem to have signed off on your decency, little boy. Who the fuck are you? You don't recognize the Border Lynx? You should already know my name by now You're... Lynx or Mink or whoever you are, this is getting heavy. So could you return it to the owner? Yes, sir! Why did I do that? I'm sorry. Please! I'm so sorry. It's because of you. This is my money! Would repenting now cleanse my disgraced blood? I reproach myself to no end! Weep. Weep until your bad blood is all washed away in tears. Who doesn't make mistakes? Did we come into this world to cry? As long as there are youngsters like you who will acknowledge their sins, our future looks bright! Goodness! It's time to say goodbye. Goodbye. But, sir! Sir! What do you want? I live this sorry life because I met the wrong kind of people. I wanted to take the right path, but reality would not let me do so. But if you take me under your wing I will dedicate my entire life to doing the right thing! He's so handsome. I'm not big enough of a man to be responsible for another's life. I understand what you mean but look around. I'm sure you'll find someone much worthier. Let us not forget how we crossed our destined paths today. Dachimawa Lee! Dachimawa Lee! DACHlMAWA LEE! Shanghai Station, China Please! Help me! Trying to resist me makes you even more irresistible. And being the men we are, how can we pass this up? Yummy. I'm sure she tastes like wild raspberries. Why are doing this? I'll scream! Go on, scream. We also enjoy having women scream and swear at us. Stop! No wonder the sky was as overcast as my wife's fugly face today. It was a sign that I would meet an obnoxious guest from Korea. You should be careful. Or something bad might happen. You filthy Korean! I'll let you sleep on a cold bed, six feet under! Nothing like Korea's Tekkyun to wipe the smile off your grotesque face! Tekkyun? I'll take you on. This should be fun. Oh, no! You protect yourself quite well. I see you've been taking lessons from a master. But you underestimated me! Take that! Use karate! Why are you falling down? You Korean! This samurai will take you on! Didn't know this! Roll! Broken! I'm hit! Take that! - Poor maiden. - You're so noble! Don't worry. Woo, my ribs! Impressive. You live up to your reputation. I'm Mari and I'll be your partner on this mission. Then? You are really something. I'm Agent 6. I'm not sure I like this welcome. I apologize if we offended you. But we needed to see if you were up to the task. You're on this mission with me? But what about Geum Yeon-ja? I guess you haven't heard. She's been missing since 2 days ago. It's unlikely she's still alive. - No way. - Yes way. Agent Yeon-ja was tracking a leak within the agency when she disappeared. This is "Snowy Horse," a restaurant in Tokyo. She knew Japanese agents met there, and worked undercover as a waitress. So the horse got to her. According to her reports, Japanese spies are looking for this. Real gold? Only 14k. No, more like a single coat, actually. That's not important. What's inside is really important! Inside the Buddha! The statue contains a list of all our secret agents who are working around the world to raise funds for our independence. What? Agent 8 managed to get the list and is waiting for us in Manchuria. The problem is, Manchurian bandits are tracking this statue too. You must go to our lab at Princeton University to get weapons and funds. Princeton University, 08544 New Jersey, USA Research Center for the provisional government of Korea Who is this! You're still in your prime. And you're still a sweet talker. I heard about your mission. It will be your most difficult and more dangerous mission yet. Laying down my life is not a big deal when it is for my country. ~ Until the East Sea and the Beckdoo Mountains all wear away ~ May God protect our country. ~ Rose of Sharon and the beautiful Geumgang mountains ~ May you live on forever with Korea and its people. You bad man! - Up to your old tricks again? - What? Stealing women's hearts. There's no time for jokes. Geum Yeon-ja is... You're right. I forgot we have no time to waste. Take this. What's this weapon? Hold on. Hold your temper. This is a breath of heaven. This gum was developed in Mexico and the U.S. from the mid 1800s. It's a must for agents like yourself who meet all kinds of people. It stays chewy without melting. Now let's get started. You'r e familiar with this model, right? This is... lt's the latest automatic model. But it's made of an alloy unlike the other models. That's why it's heavy. One smack and it's lights out. But in order to match the weight, the barrel is filled with a special alloy, so you have to use the bullets in a different gun. And last but not least... lsn't that a sprayer? You think like a field agent. This is not simply a sprayer. This is a portable bidet and it's still in development in other countries. What? Our agents suffered from irregular life styles and sleeping out frequently. Agent 62 who worked in Frankfurt lost his life to bleeding caused by hemorrhoids. So! After a long stakeout you can say goodbye to that uncomfortable after feeling. Air Force Aerodrome, Nevada, U.S.A. Air Force Aerodrome, Nevada, U.S.A. I'm sorry for sending only Agent Mari with you on a dangerous mission. After all, it only seats two people. It would be my pleasure to go with You bad man! I'm so embarrassed! That's gotta hurt. She looks tough but she's still a soft-hearted woman. Please look after her. It makes no difference on a mission. Agent Mari is just an agent to me. You've opened up to so many female agents before, so I'm surprised by that remark. I want to make one thing very clear. Geum Yeon-ja is the last tenant of my heart. Then accomplish this mission in her memory! Are you crying? It is rain, I believe. There's a speed limit up ahead. Please reduce your speed. Antique Alley, Manchurian International Trade Market Hello, Come in. Good day. You have many good items. I didn't know there was such a place. Just tell me what you need. We're looking for a statue of Buddha. We have them. What kind are you looking for? . One that's made of gold. Oh, dear. - We have no golden ones. - No? We heard that you had it. You were misinformed. Misinformed? Agent 8. No! So the statue sprouted wings Agent 8? Produce the statue before I count to 3. You coward! One. Just kill me! Two! For our independence! Three! Watch where you're going! I'm sorry. You even speak Chinese. How many languages do you speak? Enough to embrace the whole world. Oh my God. How could they? Maybe... We were too late. If your hair hadn't gotten caught up in the propeller, we might have arrived in time. I don't know what to say. I take full responsibility for not separating my emotions from my job. Agent 8! I thought I wouldn't get to say goodbye. I'm relieved to see you. Save your breath. It's too late. Agent 8! Agent 8! Agent 8! I didn't carry out my mission. Please forgive me. Who dare forgive who? Human beings do not have the right to give forgiveness. There isn't much time... What? It was the Manchurian bandits. A man called Mr. Wang is their contact man. Mr. Wang! If you take a horse... to the place I tell you... You might catch up with them... The horses... out back. No! Agent 8! Agent 8! Sangpal! Black Dragon River Agent 8 is gone forever, so the world is working against us. That means we are alone in the world. If you think of Agent 8 leaving us, I would say this is more of an upsetting and painful situation. How did he die? The Manchurian bandits tortured him and suffocated him to death, by forcing snot and saliva down his throat. Those villains! We should move before it's too late. The two of us? No. The statue is obviously there. So you must get it, even without me. You stay here in case... Don't say that! Not even as a joke! Really Mari! I don't want to put you in danger. Dachimawa Lee. Promise me that you'll come back to me. - We shouldn't. - We should. Why is my heart beating so? My head and my heart do not agree. I'm ready. - l can't do this! - You can. Your lips are drawing me in, - l know. - Yeon-ja, I'm sorry. Fool. Sneaking in is going to be tough. One smack and it's lights out. This isn't enough. What shall I do? so you have to use the bullets in a different gun. Professor Nam prepared me for every possible situation. I just hope he lives a long, full life and continues working for our country. Don't kick. Pull. Drop your weapons and raise your hands! Wait, this is Manchuria! I said, drop your weapons and raise your hands! I like your guts. What do you want? I hear there's a lot of money to be made here. I want a cut. What are you talking about? The Golden Buddha. What the hell are you talking about? Whoever chops his head off gets a casket of gold! ~ l think of him when it rains. ~ He was always quiet. ~ He hid the pain of love, ~ and cried over the one who left him. ~ One rainy day in the car, he asked me, ~ What's the saddest thing in the world? ~ He said affection was sadder than love, ~ and lowered his head then. ~ He played the guitar for me in my hospital room. ~ He comforted me and I loved him. ~ He left without a word of goodbye. ~ Where is he and is he happy? ~ Does he ever think of me? ~ Oh, how I still miss him so. ~ He came into my heart. Quickly! I told you not to come down here! There's no time. My license is restricted to cars! I told you I didn't have the right license! Where's the statue? Here! Mari! Oh, no. Bring me his dead body! Quick! Find the Golden Buddha! Come on, get a move on! Oh, no. Oh, no. Where am I? Who are you? Why am I here? Oh, no. I can't remember anything. How I came here. Who I am... I don't know who you are but I get the feeling you're a rich businessman or a diplomat. Why is that? You had a lot of cash in your pocket. So I guess you're buying lunch? What would I do with money when I don't even know who I am? This was in your pocket too. I don't know where it's from but it looks like a sturdy device. I'm not sure, but I don't think... You're whining over a water bottle? No, no. lt's just that... How come you don't have protection money for me, huh? Do I have to beat the crap out of you? What are you gawking at? Get out of here, all of you. Sir! You should be careful. Just let me know if you have any problems. What a strange man. Hold on. How long has it been? You know me? You're gonna be like that just 'cause I made a tiny mistake? What are you doing way out here? I don't know. You've seen me before? Sir! I know it's my fault for not showing you that I'm a better man but you keep this up and I'll get upset. - Who the hell am I! - Let me go! If you don't want to be associated with me, just say so. There's no need to embarrass me in front of all these people. Like I told you before, I didn't plan to keep living like this. I have an aging mother, sisters ready to get married, my cousins, and half cousins born out of wedlock. A huge family to take care of! You're so cruel. What's his family got to do with me? I don't know. Dachimawa Lee. Wait and see. You should have knocked me down when you had the chance! I shall never forget how you snubbed me twice! Boss! Lynx? You're from Korea, right? We're looking for a Korean. You be our man. It fits you well. That's the only thing my father left me along with his cooking knife. Having memories is a beautiful thing even if you are alone or sad. Whereas I.. remember absolutely nothing at all.. Mister. Can you chop some wood so I can light a fire? Hurry up with the firewood! How am I supposed to with a broken ax? Then what do we do? We could starve or freeze to death without fire. Are you suggesting I use my fist? What are you mad at me for? You could use the knife in the house. Mister! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Enough! . Move back, you dickheads! You got nine lives. You thought you could hurt me and get away with it? Why are you doing this? What's with you? Turned into a sissy, now, have you? Dachimawa Lee? What a loser! Dachimawa Lee? is there some mistake? Mistake? Why, you fuck! Where are your manners? You insist on disappointing me? To think I used to respect you! I've seen enough. Let's just chop his head off. Just one minute. You want to live? We could let you. Then you'd have to pay us back. Crawl under my legs and bark like a dog! But... Or we could show her a good time. Let me go! How could you do this to your own countryman? My country? Where I stand is my country. Seeds change according to the soil. You wilted and I bloomed! Boss! Wait! You're torn. Look, Dachimawa Lee is crawling! I said bark, you fuck! Wuff. Louder! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! Wuff! You're so freakin' talented! You think your fist is all that? Why, it's all soft and mushy. Get up, you fuck! Go on, do your thing! Please... Bring it on, smart ass! That was fun. Boss, if we kill him now, it won't make us feel much better. His hands are useless now, so we can keep him here and torment him whenever we like. That sounds good. You're certainly worthy of being my blood brother. You're no better than a worm! We win! Mister! Get up, Mister! Come on! Are you up? Then help me with this. We have to burn all this and leave. What? Leave? They said they'd be back. Burning everything and running away is not the answer! I may not know who I am but I know what's right and what's wrong! Life is not about running away! You're all talk, you know that? Give me that. You don't even know who you are. What can you possibly do when you can't even use your arm? This is...! - Give me that. - My, God... You have a way out or what? - You shouldn't be reading this! - What is it! It's a romance novel. There might be more. It's hot! It's hot! Yeah. This is it! That's.. The knife inside isn't for cooking. It's the broken sword of a warrior. Your father wasn't a cook. He was a warrior turned hermit. Dammit! You're strutting your stuff! Come on, then. Why are you stopping, fucker! Feeling better now, Dachimawa Lee? Last time was no fun, so I waited until you got better. But seeing as you look fine, either you recovered real fast or I didn't hit you hard enough! It's all gone! You must have saved on bandages! I thank God for bringing you back. You just picked your day to die. The day is too nice to die alone. You all had your last meals, right? Why, you bastard! The one-armed swordsman! This is more and more interesting! Here are the tickets for you villainous bastards! What tickets? For the express train! Curiosity is killing me! I wonder what tickets Big Mouth with no balls got for us? Stop stalling and just blurt it out! All in good time. It's where all men of evil like you go, lt's going to be a long trip anyway. You don't mean...hell? Why, you! I'll send you on a one-way train! You're going nowhere near heaven anyway! What are you waiting for? . Off with his head! You're all tied up. Don't come any closer! I'm ready! I'm blocking! Pathetic to the end! Totally impenetrable... Hey, Boss! Fuck it! Oh, no! He cut me off! He's so handsome. Ow! Ouch! He's so strong! You bore me! I'll just have to fall! Faking it? Get up! I'm sorry, sir! Woo! Another beating! You're overacting. Ouch! I'm going to have to fall! You thought I couldn't remember who I was? Border Lynx and Mr. Wang! Both of you! You brought me both luck and misfortune. First, you trampled on my pride and gave me humiliating pain. But physical pain fades away! The greater pain was not knowing who I was. But when you hit me and I hit my head, the impact brought my memory back. - He's combing? - Then you are..? He looks fine. - Border Lynx! - Oh, dear. You shed crocodile tears on the train to Shanghai! Don't expect me to have mercy on you! Wait, sir! I know the whereabouts of the thing and the woman you're looking for. The thing is already in Switzerland. He said that a mole in your agency did this to you. The mole is... How could you, Boss? Switzerland? A mole in the agency? Mr. Wang! Stop! I need more answers from this tongue. Then I'll cut it for you myself. What's this? It's me! He's like the wind. Dachimawa Lee... Hurry! If we had met in good times we could have been friends. It's a shame. No way. We couldn't be friends anyway because of our age difference. Mister. Girl with no name. It's time for goodbye. Take this to remember me by. This was mine. Mister, Now that your memory is back, please tell me your name. Mister! Mister! You'll always be in my heart! I have no regrets now! International Conference Venue, Underground bunker, Switzerland Dachimawa Lee! What happened? Where have you been? I had a slight problem so I took a little detour. What about Agent Mari? Oh, no... Something doesn't add up. Only Agent Mari, you, Agent 6, and I knew about this mission. According to my sources, we have a mole in our midst. Where did you get that information? 3 minus 1 is 2. You and me makes 2. 2 minus 1 means one of us is the mole. Why don't you show your true colors? After you contacted me, I got busy and found out that the statue and the money will be taken from a secret safe and exchanged in Geneva. It won't be too late to continue our conversation there. What makes you so sure? The confidence of someone who holds the key to the truth. That's a rare commodity. You can't dodge an unexpected bullet. I leave the rest to you. Swiss Secret Dairy Bank That is the meeting place. Only the main participants can go in so you won't need back-up. So the truth will out. We'll see when we open it. Whether it's a treasure chest or a Pandora's box. Wait! You follow that Japanese fellow. I shall follow the Shadow Man. Chances are the statue is in the Japanese man's bag! Get the bag and meet me at the opera theater we talked about! The opera theater! I must hurry. All righty, then! Oh, beautiful. Oh, my God. Lamb? Oh, no, lamb. Oh, my God, this lamb! Oh, no, boring. Hey, lambster! Lambs out, fleas! Stop following me! Stop following me! Come here! Damanegi! - What's that freakin' snowball! - l don't know! Sayonara. Damanegi! Damn! That slippery little eel. Almost there! Why, that little-! Take that! All right! - Farewell! - My secret weapon! What a loser... Swiss National Opera Theater Over here! You're...? Shh! They might be listening to us. What happened? Everything was a plot. A plot? The mole in our agency is... Oh, no! Hide! That treacherous... So how do you feel now that your secret is out? What! You still have no idea... - Enough of your lies! - Look at this first! What! Yeon-ja! You still don't get it? The mole is none other than- So your efforts paid off. No! No! Not after everything I went through to find you... It can't be... I was one step ahead of you. Save your second rate drama for your buddy to hell! I faked my death. A precaution to counter the intel that the agency was tracking the mole. Actually, she's the daughter of the traitor. Then... I'm dying here! Unfortunately, Agent 9 lost his life to save mine. So instead, I became Agent 6 and continued with the mission. Then who are you? The real me? This is who... I really am. Then... That motorcycle was rigged. And you made me drive it on purpose even though I had the wrong license. Those bandits threw only rocks yet blood burst forth from your chest as if it had been hit with a bullet. Then the sidecar fell off. Everything was planned. One more thing. She was disguised as the Shadow Man but I found out who she was. And having lost the money to me and getting shot she came here to use you. Then what happens next? Seeing as you're still talking you're not the type to go quietly. Look at me. Who do I remind you of? - But you can't be! - Are you... Madam Jang, who died at your hand! She was my sister You two caused everything! That's not our fault! You can't say it's not your fault when she died in your hands. If you don't want a hole in your chest, give me the statue in the bag. I'd rather take this to hell where your sister is. No! Give me that! - lt's for indigestion! - l can't let you die twice! How touching. Let me! No! Enough of your tactics! No more warning shots. I have one last thing to say. I'm not interested. I know that you won't shoot me. Shut your trap! No! Love for your country may have faded but not the love you have for me! - Enough! - Take it! - Stop! - No! Mari! I hate you. I don't want to die. No use regretting it now, is it? Stop that. Just as my heart was finally ready to let in a new tenant... lt's getting dark in here. It actually is dark. I don't want it to end like this... The silicon in your breast will save your life. Don't lose hope! You have dreams no silicon can ever replace! Being with you in my final hour makes me feel like my dirty soul has been saved. Please know this one thing. Let us not say anything more. Mari! When you're tired with a scent, you replace it with a new one. Dogs attract dogs and blood draws blood. Just throw down your toy gun. Don't worry about me. Just shoot him! Feisty as usual, kitty cat! I'll let you live with the guilt of having killed Mari! Stop! Where's..? There's no need to hurry. I have a plan. Swiss Spy Hotel Hey, you! is the international spy conference being held here? Ah! Stop! Stop! Ok. Then please check this. Serve this specialty tonight to the people on this list. Make sure you put this in their drinks. Our company made a special list of people with jetlag. and giving vitamins as gifts. Yes,sir But how's the Golden Buddha? I'll take it. - Move it! - Yes, sir! We got the statue, so our mission is accomplished. I'd like to see the statue with the list of people who have been bothering us. Well, I just happen to.. have it right here. Oriental Express from Switzerland to Shanghai How can you laugh at a time like this? Our agents' lives are in danger. I can't believe you! How would they know our agents? What? Are you kidding me? Did you hurt your head? We lost the Golden Buddha again! Would this be it? Great! May I look at it first? Of course. What a big catch! But... Did Korean agents all get Japanese aliases? Let me see! International Spy Conference Japanese Delegation Kakemochi. Denkang. Nimai. Sumu. Idiot! This is cheap gilding. We're fucked! How could you not check it? It can't be! You'll be executed for disclosing top secret information and killing agents. Then you switched the list of Korean agents with Japanese agents. The mission felt wrong right from the start. So I set a trap just in case and Damanegi fell right into it. You didn't suspect me, too, did you? I'll have to choose my answer wisely. Wait, what happened to the money? It was the Japanese agency's anyway, so let's consider it gone. Too bad. So the mission was to lose both people and money. But we found each other. You're so handsome. Yeon-ja. - Come here. - This is exciting. This feeling of security. Many were sacrificed The Yalu River but we protected it. So it is indeed 'a sweet reward at the end of the road' We were all 'in synch' and our voices were 'as one'. But wait a minute. Where are Comrades Lee and Geum? Falkner Wind Power Plant Fleming Ranch, Pennsylvania, USA So this is how it all ends. After all, the mighty change history. Money and brains empower you, not your fist. Too bad for those who aren't aware of that. You mean life is all about deceiving each other? . While we take over these US plains, they'll forget about this money, and then we go back home to take over the positions left? It's a brilliant plan. What? - Excuse me, sir. - Who are you? Hold on. Hold on. What's the problem? There's a problem with the money you're spending. What? It is cash! I'm sorry, but they're counterfeits. Made in Japan. You lose. You can't be? It's a great day for a trip together. You backstabbing villains! How could this be? Then you are? They call me... Dachimawa Lee! Please, spare my life! - Men of evil! - l have to live! - Take the last - l have a reason to live! - express train - We are fellow countrymen.! - To hell! - No! What are you doing? What the... One, two, three! Keep spinning, you jerk! That's good! Spin him. round and round. A-ha! Bull's eye! Oh, my gosh! Oh, dear! They're gone. My lady. Why are you looking at me like that? Am I wearing too much make-up? No. Finally, everything is over. What about Mari who formed a love triangle with us? The only triangle in my life are triangular dumplings. Then I'll be the spicy filling in your dumpling. Even in the face of death? Nonsense. Don't say that. You must have resented me. How did you guess? Yeon-ja. I think it's time we said goodbye to this place. With you, always, Dachimawa Lee. Yeon-ja... Oh, my. - Finally... - l'm trembling. You tease. Help! Farewell. Action! So handsome! Previously on CSI Lou Gedda is getting away with murders. Warrick is a loose cannon,He was in Gedda's strip club, - conducting his own police investigation. - What do you want? Everything. No! I did not kill her. Grissom,you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl. You take this suspention,or you are fired. Guys like Lou Gedda,they don't skip on murder or extortion by being lucky. - I got an update for you. - Good work. Crime scene at the funeral. Can't get much deader than this. Liver temp certainly couldn't. He is being dead more the 24 hours Any indication what he died from? No,not a sign of trauma. I spoke with Mrs. Bell,she has no idea who the other DB from the casket is. Okay,thanks. That has got to be the biggest casket I've ever seen. This is the Alvis model. We are a fat country, Nick. Here is our proof. You don't think they come out the factory room for two though. No,the extra compartment is custom addition. This board is what seperated the two bodies. Top guy was just too heavy. Maybe it's the scandle to save money. Mortuary is obligated to bury indigents of no charge. Maybe save a burial plot by burying John Doe with John Smith. of affairs, which Gerda never knew nothing about. But he really never got over Veronica. And in the last Saturday they met, for the first time in 12 years. He went out to see her home and he returned to the Hollow at 03:00 a.m.. Yes. How do you know? The housemaid had a toothache. Lucy has far too many servants. And how is it that you know? I was watching out my window. The toothache, Mademoiselle? Quite another kind of ache, Monsieur Poirot. If you see me with a pistol in my hand, Simmons, the proper thing to do is come to me and say: Mr. Gudeon, would you be so kind and give me an explanation. Yes, Mr. Gudgeon. The improper thing to do is to go babbling to the Police. That is common. Where would Her Ladyship be, if we all run doing things like that, hmm? Lucy, why did you take the pistol? I'm not entirely sure, Henry. I do recall, though, waking up that morning with some sort of premonition, that there might, just might, be some kind of accident.. Accident, who might have had an accident? Well, obviously, John Christow. And, I mean, one does feel awfully sorry, of course, and one does tend to blame oneself... - Good God, Lucy! Oh, Henry! Oh, Henry! Oh, Henry, I'm so dreadfully worried about Ainswick. If Edward never marries, and he won't, you know, if Henrietta turns him down, it will all die out. It will. They will break it up and sell it off in little tiny pieces. Lucy, does it really, honestly, matter? Of course it matters. Ainswick is my home. It's all our land. No... Somebody'd got to get rid of him. Lucy, you didn't... Don't be such a fool. Do you really believe, for a moment, that I could've shot him? I invited him here, Henry. One doesn't ask guests for the weekend and start bumping them off. - Did your aunt like John Christow? - Lucy? Lucy's a cousin, not an aunt. Yes, she liked him very much. And your... also cousin, Mr. Edward Angkatell, - did he like Dr. Christow? - Not particularly. And do they like Madame Christow? It's not a matter of liking her, she's famíly. - Is she? - We're not all rich, you know? Gerda is from a branch of rather humble Angkatell's. She's tolerated, I think it's fair to say, because she's one of us. And your understanding of tolerance would be to sleep with her husband? Why did you take the revolver out of the hand of Madame Christow and drop it into the pool? A Gerda is very clumsy. She might have fired it and hurt someone. But you're not clumsy, are you? And yet you dropped it. If there were fingerprints on that revolver, that is to say, fingerprints before Madame Christow handled it, it would've been intersting to know who's they were. Meaning that you think that they were mine. You're suggesting that I shot John and then left the revolver beside him so that Gerda could come along and pick it up. But if I'd done that, give me credit for enough intelligence, to have wiped my own figerprints off first. But, Mademoiselle, you have enough intelligence to know that if there would be no fingerprints in the revolver, other than Madame Christow's, other than Madame Christow's, it would be très remarcable. Because you were all shooting with the revolver the day before. And there are something else we have just discovered. We now know that the revover that was dropped into the pool was not the revolver that killed John Christow. He was shot with a quite different gun. And you think that I shot him? When he was dying, John Christow said: "Henrietta." I told you, we were lovers. Oh yes, of course . He was your lover. So, as he was dying, he says, "Henrietta." Very touching. - I don't think there is any need to sneer. - I am not sneering. But I do not like being lied to. I've admitted that I'm not very truthful. But I don't kill people, Monsieur Poirot. Gerda! Poor dear, Gerda. I'm so sorry. Not getting too a little sleep, I trust. What is an adjournment, you know? You must be famished. Why don't you come back to the Hollow for lunch? I'm taking Gerda directly home. She needs rest and quiet, not this. What did they see in Christow? That wretched woman is completely heartbroken. - Poor devil. - Are you all packed? I'm getting lift to town. All set. Come on, Midge. Bye, Edward. Bye. Edward! - Damn cold! - It is, rather. What's this one? It looks a bit like Gerda. Cowed and hunched. She modelled for me. Don't you dare tell her that's what what I ended up with. I call it "The Worshiper". Who is she worshiping? John. Did you understand all that business with the second gun? No, but it lets Gerda off the hook, doesn't it? Let's have some tea and toasts, then I'll take you to your lodgings. Mademoiselle, do not! John has been shot. He's dead. Edward, Midge, how wonderful to see you both! He rescued me from Madame Alfrege. It was frightfully romantic. I was whisked from the shop and taken to lunch at The Connaught and, do you know what? I never went back. I'm a dull dog, I know. I am no much good at anything. I just read books, putter about. Midge has agrred to come to Ainswick and be my wife. And nothing could make me happier. Of white satin, don't you think? And ivory Prayer Book. What about bridesmaids? Oh, I don't fuss. Just a quiet wedding. I quite agree. They don't match, do they? I mean it, there's always a rather plain one, that ruins the whole-- Absolutely dozens of them, poking about in the woods, making a terrible mess with all the pheasants! Why are they still here? They're searching for the missing revolver, Midge. Bonjour, Mademoiselle. Good morning, Monsieur Poirot. Will they find it, do you think? Soon, I should say. You have returned very suddenly from London, Mademoiselle. There's a party for Midge and Edward, who, believe it or not, are getting married. Why, did you think the murderer would return to the scene of the crime? You know, it did seem to me, from the very beginning, that either this crime was very simple, so simple that it was very difficult to believe in its simplicity, or it was very complex. And it is to say that we are contending against a mind that is able of inventions that are intricate and ingenious. So that every time we seem to be heading towards the truth, we're actually being led away from it. A mind that is subtle and yes, very ingenious, which is plotting agaist us the whole time. And succeding. What is that to do with me? It is a creative mind, Mademoiselle. - And this is a strange tree. - It's a Igdrasil. A memento of my childhood, I draw it everywhere, doodling, you know. I've seen it before, in the pavillion, by the pool. In the pavillion? Where it must have been drawn on Sunday morning. Oh yes, on the little table. - But that was on Saturday afternoon. - Non, non... It was not there when Gudgeon brought the cherry glasses. - Then it must have been in Sunday afternoon. - Non, because Grange's men did not leave the area until dusk. Oh, yes! I remember. It was after dinner, on Saturday. Non, Mademoiselle Savernake. People do not doodle in the dark. No, I think you were in the pavillion on Sunday, after 12:00, when Gudgeon brought out the cherry glasses. I think you stood by the table, watching someone, waiting for someone and you doodled. I didn't go down to the pool until 13:00. Just after John Christow had been shot. But Igdrasil testifies against you. You were there and shot Dr. Christow or you were there and saw who did. This is outrageous! Do you think you are cleverer than I? The inquest resumes tomorrow, and all I've got is vague suspicions leading to nowhere. Nowhere, instead of somewhere. That is it. Do you know, half the time I think those Angkatells know all about it. Oh, they do know all about it. Henrietta Savernake? Nothing from her either. She went straight to Chelsea. I searched her studio with a fine tooth comb, but there's no gun. Just art pieces. Sculptures, funny looking horses, bits of wood, metal... - Horses, did you say? - Wel, one horse. If you can call it a horse. - A horse? - Yeah, what's so fascinating about that? It's a point of psicology, Inspector. How quickly can you get me up to London? What're you looking for, sir? This. The horse. Merci. Quite good, actually. Merci. Monsieur Poirot! Mademoiselle Savernake doesn't like horses. Voilá. I think that this will prove to be the murder weapon. - So Miss Savernake did it. - Non! Looks to me bloody likely. No, Mademoiselle Savernake is not, in my opinion, a murderer. Let us be quiet about our discovery, for the time being, Inspector. And watch. Let us be intelligent. Is Her Ladyship at home? You will find Lady Angkatell in the greenhouse. If I might, the inquest is concluded, murder by person or persons unknown. Is it necessary to trouble Her Ladyship further, sir? Lady Angkatell. Monsieur Poirot. Tell me, what are your views on compost? I've come to offer you apologies for the inconveniencies you have suffered. It's high time to put a full stop to the whole thing. You do understand me, don't you? I'm not sure that I do, Lady Angkatell. Oh, come, come, Poirot. You understand perfectly! Since Inspector Grange has failed to find the murder weapon, he'll have to let the whole thing drop. You, I dare say, won't. Non, I shall not let it drop. What if were told the truth? Would you like to tell me the truth? Oh, Monsieur Poirot, I would love to tell you the truth. Then, of course, we could all agree that John Christow is over and done with. Could we, Madame? You really are very foreign, aren't you? Are you quite sure you have not something, Lady Angkatell? Something just came upon me, you might have overlooked it. I could be wrong, of course, and you could've handled everything, but since you never mentioned it, I'm a little concearned... What's the matter, Lucy? - It's the holster. - What? Oh Henrietta, the holster! The gun was in a holster! - Yes, Collie? - It's Miss Savernake. The holster, Gerda! Where is the holster? You have to give me the holster and then you'll be safe. Not completely safe. Dommage. Poirot! How did you...? Sometimes, the fastest car it is not fast enough, Mademoiselle. Not when it races against the brain. Where are the children? - Elsie's taken them to the Zoo. - Thank Heaven for that! I know that you killed your husband, Madame. Yes. I did. Why did you do it, Gerda? Why did you kill John? Because it was all a lie! Everything! I thought he was the noblest man in the world. But I saw his face when he followed that woman, that evening... I knew he'd loved her, before he'd married me, but I thought... I thought it was over. I tried to sleep, but I couldn't. It was the middle of the night. I had to know. They were there. I could hear them. John and Veronica Cray. I believed in him as though he were God. I worshiped him. And it was all a lie. I had to kill him. You do see that? I had to! I am not quite so stupid as everyone thinks. I knew I could kill John and the Police would never know because I had read in this novel how they can tell which gun fires the bullet. So, I took two. Sir Henry had shown how to load and fire the day before. It was easy. You shove the cilinder back into the frame and you're ready for shooting. I'd shot with one then hide it and let them find me holding the other. I forgot about the leather thing. - The holster. - I forgot about it too. I also forgot. The memory, it is selective, n'est ce pas? And then I heard Inspector Grange mention this holster, this holster of leather-- I remembered where I had seen it before. What's that? Looks like leather work, sir. Where is your bag for the leather work? I-I think it's in the surgery. The surgery? I seat there. In his chair. I'll fetch it for you, shall I? S'il vous plaît. But Madame... Oh, I'm not going anywhere, don't worry. When you return to your studio, I'm affraid you'll discover that one of your sculptures, it has been destroyed. It is the sculpture of the head of the horse. It could have worked, Mademoiselle, if you did not tell me how much you detested the creatures. I know that you were helped by your family, once they knew what you wanted done. Henrietta. Isn't it possible that Gerda came along by the pool, found John lying there and just picked up the revolver when we came on the scene? This is what Gerda says? Yes. But why do you wanted it done, Mademoiselle? Because John asked me to. That's what he meant when he said, "Henrietta". He was asking me to protect Gerda. And he knew that I'd do anything he wanted, because I loved him. Oui. I began to realize the truth when I saw there was a pattern, a pattern to implicate everyone, other than Gerda Christow. You deliberatly planted Igdrasil to catch my attention and put yourself under suspicion. I put the pistol on the egg basket and then I put the new eggs on top of the pistol. Oh, I doubt there'll be any fingerprints, sir. Because I polished it with my handkerchief before replacing it, sir. And Lady Angkatell, and the family, they closed hands and colluded, because... There's only one thing to do, if you want to clear from suspicion the person who is actually guilty, suggest guilt elsewhere, but never localize it . - Vite! - Oh, my God! Gerda! Gerda! Help her, for God's sake! It is too late. Potassium Cyanide. Wife of a doctor... She knew exactly what to do. What happens to me now? Go, my child. Your place is with the living. I will remain here with the dead. Man's voice: This here is a ghost story. But this ghost story is different from all the others. It's different because this one's all true. I know because I was there. It all happened right here in this very town-- across the bridge, over by the old graveyard. It was all hallows' Eve, it was all hallows' Eve, or what people like to call Halloween. And it all happened down there... In the hollow. ( Screams ) ( Dull thud ) Now on this particular evening there was a party going on at the home of a wealthy man named baltus van tassel. The townsfolk came from all over to celebrate. And amongst these revelers was the new schoolmaster ichabod crane. This blows. Brody, knock it off, I'm trying to hear this. It is kinda creepy, if you think about it. It is kinda lame, if you think about it. Some people say that he often resembled some people say that he often resembled a crane while walking through town. - ( Crowing ) - ( Laughing ) Man: Karen, let's go. You can go if you want, but I'm staying here. Storyteller: Ichabod was understandably excited to be invited to this party, as he was finally able to court the beautiful young daughter of its host, Katrina van tassel. Woman: Guys, can we do this tomorrow night? Man: Tomorrow night's the hayride. Besides, you said you want a scare, right? Well, I'm gonna give you one. Oh, huh-uh. - What are you scared? - Woman: Yeah, that... And it's wrong to chump around on someone's grave. Where's that creepy old groundskeeper guy? She's got a point there, brode. Remember when we snuck in that one time, back in third grade? He was just trying to scare us. Man: Dude chased us with an ax, man. - Who does that? - I'll tell you what, we'll go up, put our hand in and we'll call it a night. What's the big deal with all of this, anyways? The big deal is that you, Karen and everybody else around here take the legacy of this town for granted. You act like it's just another place on the map. You're drunk. But it's not just another place on the map. This is the birthplace of the most famous ghost story there ever was. Ow, you're hurting me! Brody: This should be the end all, be all of Halloween. And what do we got to show for it? A junior-boy storyteller and a hokey haunted hayride. Scott, could you please get this gorilla off of me? Hey, let her go, man. I'll tell you what... All it would take is one bad Halloween-- like maybe three kids going to a graveyard and only one comes back. Then people would know. Then they would know what kind of town we live in. Woman: Go stick your hand in. What? You heard me, you go do it-- you heard me, you go do it-- see if anything grabs you. Show us how it's done. That's the spirit. See, nothing. - ( Metal clanks ) - Oh my god! - Brody! - Oh my god, help me, please guys, help! All right, get him, get him. ( Laughs ) Woman: Jackass. What's wrong? Where you go-- it was just a joke. Hey, where you going? You guys be careful out there. And remember, if you see the horseman... Make for the bridge. And as ichabod recalled brom's horrible warning, he kicked and whipped and yelled at his horse, urging it to go faster, the headless horseman just behind him. Sparks flew from the hoofs of the rider's unholy steed. And ichabod looked up and through the trees he could see the bridge. Ichabod and his horse dashed across the bridge, the headless horseman just behind him. The headless horseman just behind him. Ichabod chanced a look back, expecting to see the fearful apparition gone, but instead he saw the horseman stand up in his stirrups, cock back his arm that held the rider's bloody severed head, with Gore and guts still clinging to the skull. And he fired the hideous missile... And that was the last that anyone ever saw of the old schoolmaster. Now some say that ichabod actually escaped the horseman now some say that ichabod actually escaped the horseman and left sleepy hollow to become a lawyer in New York, not far from here, while others say that it was brom who chased ichabod out of town, out of jealousy. But the old Dutch wives of these parts still maintain that ichabod crane, the new schoolmaster, was whisked away on that Halloween evening by the most horrific ghoul ever seen, the headless horseman of sleepy hollow. The headless horseman of sleepy hollow. ( Applause ) - Hey. - Honey, that was super. Thank you. Where's dad? He wanted to come, sweetie, he was exhausted. I think the start of the season and the move and everything really took it out of him, you know? Yeah, I know. ( Laughs ) - Thank you for coming. - Sure. See you. ( Sighs ) I said I was sorry, what else do you want me to do? How could you just stand there and have him treat me like that? Hey, he just gets carried away with this whole legend. I mean I guess he's proud of the history around here. Besides, you were having fun. No, I wasn't. Really? You know, somebody dared him to put his hand in the tomb. Who was that? I just wanted to see if he'd get eaten. So, is there something to that whole scared sex thing? Maybe. ( Metal clangs ) What was that? Ha, ha, that's not funny, Scott. It's Brody. He's screwing around in van ripper's shed. Scott, please don't, I-- just stay here, all right? I'm sick of this. Hey, Brody! Scott. The door is open. ( Sword unsheathes ) Spooky, very spooky, you had me going for a sec. Hey Amber, come inside the- ( sword slices ) - ( Splatters ) Amber: Scott? Scott? ( Gasps ) ( Groans ) ( Footsteps approaching ) - ( Roars ) - ( Screaming ) Karen: That was great. ( Laughs ) I'm already giving you a ride, you can stop with the flattery. No, no, I mean it though, you were really good. And thank you for the ride, I really appreciate it. Oh, it's no problem. ( Sighs ) So, uh... Where's Brody? Didn't you guys come together? No. Brody's got a short attention span. But then he's captain of the football team, so I guess you get what you pay for, right? - ( Laughs ) - I guess. I just- - I guess I thought you guys were like a thing. Were like a thing. No, we're not a thing. I mean, am I getting myself into trouble here? New in town-- already making moves on the quarterback's main squeeze. Okay, first off, I'm nobody's squeeze. And second, Brody isn't exactly my ideal. I like a guy who's interested in more than just my pom-poms. Maybe you and I should, I don't know, go for a coffee or something sometime. ( Screams ) Oh my god. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm just a little shaky, I'm fine. - You sure you're all right? - ( Screams ) ( Woman panting ) You scared the crap out of us. - You okay? - I'm doing about as well as could be expected, which I don't suppose is all that good. What were you doing in the road? I could have killed you. I was listening, teacher. I was listening. Why are you calling me that? Ian, he's a gravekeeper and he's obviously drunk. My name is claus van ripper, although that doesn't mean much to ye. And I'm not drunk. I do take care of the cemetery and I need to talk to ye. There is something you need to know. Let's get out of here, he's obviously drunk. Let him have his bender, let's go. I just about killed the guy. We can't leave him here if he's drunk. Shh! Quiet. Something's coming. Huh-uh. What the hell are you doing out here, huh? Shh-shh. Ya hear that? Ian: What? - Let's just-- - ( Screams ) ( Laughs ) You okay, junior? You look like you seen a ghost. You've been up to the yard, haven't you? What are you doing up there? Just trying to give Scott and Amber a scare. Trying to instill a little history in them. You, if anybody, should understand that. You shouldn't be up in the yard-- not tonight, not ever, especially not tonight. Relax van ripper, we didn't mess up any of your landscaping. I'm sorry about stranding you. It's okay, Ian was taking me for coffee. Beggin' your pardon, ma'am, but you should go with young vandersnot here. - I need to talk to the teacher alone. - What? He's come back. He's come back for ye. I need to talk to you. - Let's go. - Karen: Ian, Ian. ( Sighs ) I can't leave this guy in the middle of the road. Look at him, he's obviously smashed. I don't want him to get hit by somebody else. Rain check? Okay. Ya sure you don't want to sit, son? I can't, I'm already out way past my curfew. My dad is gonna kill me. I don't even know why I came here in the first place. Oh, you don't, huh? Well, I think you do. It's your destiny. You can't run from your destiny, teacher. What the are you talking about? And what's with all this teacher crap? ( Laughs ) You are a stubborn one, aren't ye? I have to go, okay? I'm really sorry, but I do have to go. I call ye teacher, on account of that's what you are. Not by your trade, not even by your daddy's trade, but farther back. Yeah, way farther back than that. Your family lived here right in this house, your family lived here right in this house, nine generations back. A teacher, a man called ichabod. ( Laughs ) - Ichabod? - Mmm. Like ichabod crane? Are you kidding me? Is this your big talk? My last name's not even crane. It ain't no time for kidding. I know your last name, I'll show you. Your last name... It's right-- maybe some other time, all right, claus? I gotta go, okay? Hey. Wait, teacher! Teacher, you got to listen to me. Now listen, you got to let me show you. I know you don't believe me, but if you'd let me show you-- in the graveyard, Irving's grave is covered with vines. And the vines is flowing with blood. Stop it, okay? You messed up my night with Karen, you made me drive out here, I'm late. And why, huh? Because you wanted to get drunk. - Huh? - I gotta go. Wait, wait, wait... What? You might make it. I don't feel nothing. Go on. Go on. And I ain't drunk, ya hear me? I ain't drunk. ( Rock music playing on radio ) ( Engine shuts off, music stops ) Hello? Claus, is that you? ( Horse whinnies ) ( Screams ) - ( Horse whinnies ) - ( Man laughing ) Brody? You all right, junior? Look like you seen a ghost, again. For Christ's sakes man, I think you dented my car. Relax, car's not worth but 500 bucks. What the hell are you doing out here? Just trying to warm up old Carter here. It's been itchin' to get out. I also needed to see if I could see out of this costume. Yeah, it looks really nice. Do you have a key for this gate? Nope. Nobody does. That gate's been locked up since forever. You got to go back over the bridge. You know, man, I've been thinking-- you should leave that to the professionals, yeah, I think you should stop hanging around Karen so much. Date somebody on your own level. My own level, huh? We had a long talk. When I took her back home tonight, it was all about us at the homecoming. You know what, Brody, Karen's a big girl, and I think you should let her make her own decision, okay? ( Rock music playing ) Man: Ian, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk about this later, pal. Right now you better get to sleep. I want you at practice tomorrow. - I can't. - You can and you will. End of story. You broke curfew and you owe me. You're gonna be part of the team. I am part of the team, dad. ( Rock music playing ) Bye. Ian, Ian, hi. I can't believe you're leading the poor kid on like that. It's karmically unsound. ( Laughs ) Oh, excuse me, miss morality. Maybe I like him. He's funny, smart and still in high school. If you're trying to make Brody jealous, I could always set you up with one of rob's friends. Thanks, but no thanks. I have this thing against guys who have Greek letters tattooed on their ass. - Tattoos beat zits. - Hey. - Hi. - Nice outfit. Thank you, it's the pep rally, today. You're coming, right? You know what, I'd like to, but I really can't. It's for the football team. I just feel out of place. Come on, walk me to first and I'll talk you into it. Voice on p.A.: Good morning, fellow students, - and welcome to the homeroom bulletin. - You walk me to class? - I am walking you to class. - Tonight's the ghostly hayride and tickets are selling out fast... You don't know what class you have? That's terrible. - See you at the pep rally. - Ian, listen, it would mean a lot to me if you came. You will not feel out of place, I promise. And I'll be doing all my cheers for you. - All your cheers for me? - Yes. Well... You guys seen Scott? I got first with him and I need to copy his homework. You were the one that left him in the graveyard last night, remember? Brody: Maybe him and Amber pulled an all-nighter. I haven't seen Amber either. And she never called me back last night. Brody: Man, this is bad. Do you think something happened to them? No, it's like the 50th time I've shown up without my homework. Coach is gonna flunk me. Unless... You got ballentine for geometry, don't you? Okay, guys, I'm gonna go. I'll talk to you later. Give it up. Fine, all right, just do me a favor-- will you get some wrong so that she knows it's yours at least? Whatever, man. Woman: He keeps going through my yard... Man: Okay, Mrs. vandynwick, I'll look into it. Meanwhile you just sit tight and relax. Anything comes up, I'll call you. Okay, bye. Sheriff, you gotta put a stop to this hayride. It ain't safe for them kids to be up in the yard, not tonight. It's a little early in the morning for this kind of garbage. He's come back. I'm telling you, he's come back. He's gonna be looking for a head. It ain't safe. Anybody up in that yard tonight is fair game. All right, I don't want to go through this kind of bullcrap this year. But for the sake of repetition and clarity, tonight is Halloween. There are vines growing out of Irving's grave. The horseman has returned. Tonight is Halloween. It's also the night of the annual ghostly hayride. And it's gonna go off without a hitch, no pun intended, just like it does every other year. But this ain't no normal year, not this year. Young teacher has come back and he's woke him up. Here, let me show you something. See this? Look at the name on that. - Right there. - Where did you get this? Out of the mailbox. You see the name there? Claus, the cranstons are good people. And I'd like to make a good first impression with them. You going through the mailbox like some kind of inbred-- well, that doesn't go good with my program. You're not listening to me, sheriff. You've got to stop this hayride tonight! Request denied. Request denied. Now I got some teenagers that are playing hooky I got to attend to. You, you gotta go. You're going to be picking up heads out of the graveyard. Yeah, I should only be so lucky. Teacher! What the hell are you doing here? We didn't finish our talk. Look, claus, we already discussed this. I'm not a crane, all right? I'm not. Oh, you are a crane, yes, ye are. Yes, ye are. Let me show you. Ya see, ichabod left and he changed his name right away, probably because he was worried about the horseman coming after him. Then he named his first son Richard cranston, meaning crane's son. Then two generations later his grandson went out west and changed his name to cranston. That's ye. Okay, all that's means is that there really was an ichabod and that maybe I'm related to him, but this guy that wrote this book, what's his name? Washington Irving. Maybe he just knew ichabod, huh? Used the guy's name, you ever think about that? He knew him, all right. He wrote the story about him. The legend is true. Everything in it is true. Ichabod was killed by the horseman, right? There's absolutely no way he could have had kids, or grandkids-- you know that's not true. The story says that he was never seen again. Not being seen again is not the same as not being alive. You take it, you read it and you learn everything by tonight, you understand? ( Sighs ) ( Bell rings ) You're in big trouble, mister. You said you'd be at the pep rally today. No, I didn't. You were going to before Brody interrupted us. Maybe. Shouldn't you be there, right now? Mm-hmm. Hey, I thought you knew that by heart? Oh... No, I just watched the cartoon like every Halloween, so... Okay, so how is this book more important than you coming to my pep rally? That old guy claus gave it to me. He was telling me that I'm related to ichabod. Ichabod crane? Was there really such a guy? Apparently so, there's a whole book about him. What does crazy claus know about that? - He says he's related to hans van ripper. - Who's hans van ripper? I guess some guy that let ichabod stay at his guest house. Hmm... who knew? Anyway, there's lots of cool stuff in here, actually. Stuff about the bridge and how the horseman can't cross it, 'cause if he does he bursts into flames or something-- spontaneously combusts. Okay, so what are my chances of getting a ride and that coffee? ( Laughs ) I finish practice at like 4:00. Does that sound good? Yeah, perfect, cheerleading goes till about then, too. ( Laughs ) That's if they don't fire you first. Fire me? No, I'm the best they got. ( Laughs ) You want to meet me at my car at 4:30? Sound good? Yeah, okay. Hello, Ian, whoo. Hey, you two. Ian, I just wanted to tell you how excellent you were last night. - Oh. - Wasn't he? I told you. I knew you were an actor the first time I laid eyes on you. You have got a lot of talent. Well, thank you. It was a lot of fun. Oh, that's good. Good, good. I was wondering, can I ask you a favor? Yeah, go ahead. I know this is last minute, and you can say no if you want to, but we just had a part open up on the hayride tonight. It's actually the role of the graveyard guide. I was wondering if you might help us? - It would be fabulous. - I thought Scott was going to do that. He was but he never came to pick up his costume. There's a whole script to learn and I know what a quick study you are. And I know what a quick study you are. It's just that there's a John carpenter festival on tonight, and I really wanted to watch it. Can you tape it? Please, Ian, I'm getting desperate here. You would be so perfect. Come on, Ian. And you get to introduce the white lady's tomb. Okay, fine. All right, I'll do it. Excellent! You'll come by the drama room and pick up your costume, okay? Absolutely. don't forget to invite me to the wedding. There's no wedding, just a lot of sweaty sex. ( Laughs ) Ooh... ( Bell rings ) It's this kind of lack of commitment I'm talking about. This is what keeps you guys from being number one. What the hell is so difficult about making it to practice every day? Huh? You got 10 minutes to get your butts on that field. And I don't want to see any screwing around. Vanderveer. Get Ian. Damn it, hartman, loosen the wrist. You see, you see what I told you? Just relax. Use your opponent's momentum to your own advantage. Again. ( Screams ) That move is completely illegal and you'd be disqualified in competition. However, I do admire your instincts. Ian, take a break. Jocks. You guys are big, but you're still playing soft. When I played ball, you had to be tough as nails. You had to have a hard head. I want you to get out there and focus on your power today. Okay? All right. Thanks, vanderveer. Go out and keep your eye on those guys before they hurt themselves. Yeah, sure, coach. Listen, pal, I don't care what you do in your spare time. You want to waste it with comic books and horror movies, fine. But when you're at school, you're gonna get your butt to practice. I was at practice. As long as you live under my roof, you're gonna quit acting like an idiot. That means no more fencing. You're on j.V. Football. Then I guess I'm gonna have to find another place to live. Yeah, well, you think about it. I will. Ian... I know, I know, my dad pulled me out of practice. Hey, at least you don't have to carry these things around. - Those are nice. - Uh-huh. You want to trade? Okay. - Why are you laughing? - No reason. ( Laughs ) Show me your stance. En garde. - Good. - Yeah, that's pretty good. Your turn. All right, you asked for it. ( High-pitched voice ) "Headless horseman. He's our man. If he can't do it, no one can. - Go horseman." - ( Laughs ) Very good. Cute, very cute. - Your dad will be so proud, junior. - Thanks. Brody, what do you want? Can I talk with you for a second? Yeah, sure, go ahead. In private. She's all yours. It's about the homecoming. Everybody knows your the only one I can go with. Would you settle for a maybe? Maybe? What do you mean, maybe? You got a better offer or something? Well, there maybe a dark horse in the running. Junior? ( Laughs ) You're joking? You've been hanging around him just to get me jealous. It worked, okay? Now let the guy go, and let him get over you. You need to get over yourself. Mrs. worthless said you'd be taking Scott's spot tonight. Yup. Who do you think you are, man? You're not even from here? If you screw it up and don't build me up right, I'm gonna beat your ass. Okay, thanks Brody, that's nice. I'll keep that in mind. Yeah, you do that. I used to think his entire life revolved around football, but now I think he lives just to put on that stupid headless horseman costume. Mrs. cranston: Hi, sweetheart, how was school? Fine. Dad won't quit it with this football thing. He just wants your high school experience to be something to remember. Yeah, my high school experience. I'm the ghost in the hayride tonight. You are? That's great. What is it? It's this annual haunted house thing our school does. The drama teacher asked me to do it. I'm sure dad will just be thrilled. Give him a chance, Ian, he does love you. He just has his own way of showing it. Yeah, anyway, can you do me a favor? Sure. I set up the vcr in the back and there's a couple of movies I want you to tape. Just please, whatever you do, do not let dad touch it, okay? - Okay. - All right. ( Crow cawing ) Listen ye well and heed my tongue, your journey into darkness has just begun. For as we travel through the graveyard tonight, hold on to your loved ones very tight. For as the dead arise from sleep, it's towards the light that they will creep. And if this truck should have a wreck, and if this truck should have a wreck, they'll sink their teeth into your neck. And now we begin the ghostly hayride. ( Owl hooting ) Now we just have to head down this patch of road right here towards the bridge. And you should know that this is the same road and you should know that this is the same road that ichabod traveled upon that fateful Halloween night. The northwoods area of sleepy hollow has long been known as a place densely populated by spirits and specters of every imaginable shape and size. Watch yourself. ( Growls ) ( Growls ) All right, folks, and this, my companions, is the section of the haunted wood that is inhabited by the most beautiful ghost of all-- the ill-fated bride who was slashed-- murdered by her own groom to be, and discarded in a lake not far from here. If you look closely, you can see the unearthly beauty right now. All right. Let's go. Well, folks, it seems like we almost made it out of the haunted woods alive. But it seems like we've forgotten one thing-- the most fearsome legend in all of sleepy hollow, the legend of... ( Horse hooves thumping ) Did you hear that? Shh... - ( Dull thud ) - ( Screaming ) - Give me your heads. - Let's go! ( Screaming ) ( Horse whinnies ) ( Laughs ) - You jerk. - Jeez, Karen, relax. Are you crazy?

I'm not free because you let me go. I'm free just because. Because I was born. Eventhough I've served others. Am I right, Suárez? But you did see me. Eventhough you 're a blind son of a bitch. Go away, kid. I told the whore to follow the whale. When you say so, we throw the ashes to the sea. Right? I'm gonna throw you if you don 't tell me. -I didn 't even tell Suárez. -You are Suárez. You know? You are not a kid anymore. He keeps his mouth shut. He's always been like this. When my grandpa told his stories, he wouldn't listen. Do you feel well? You can't do this kind of thing. Take this off, you're gonna get sick. -Don't treat me like if I were sick. -But you are sick. I forget about it, but you are sick. I'm fine. Just a Iittle dizzy. What fault is that of mine? Some things just happen. -Sorry, I don 't know what I'm saying.-Say whatever you want. But don 't apologize. Today, your father reminded me of mine. The things we never said. I've always blamed him for everything. What you say is true. Of course I am sick. It's a relief to hear it. I don't know how you were before, but you are beautiful. -So you 're leaving tomorrow? -I do whatever I want. Like Lola, that finally realizes what she wants.

They do not worship or believe in Satan and they do not believe in God. "Satan" is just a symbol of freedom and the ego. History. The Church of Satan started in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgis night April 30, 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, who was the Church's High Priest until he died in 1997. In the 1950s Anton LaVey made a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, some of whose members later became the leaders of the Church of Satan. Some of the people at the events were: “The Baroness” Carin de Plessen (who grew up in a Royal Palace in Denmark), Dr. Cecil Nixon (magician, Odd person, and maker of robot), underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger, City Assessor (someone who figures out values of city property) Russell Wolden, anthropologist (a person who studies culture and human development) Michael Harner, and writer Shana Alexander. Other friends of LaVey at this point were famous Science Fiction and Horror writers Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, and Fritz Leiber Jr. In its first year, the Church of Satan was in the news a lot because they performed a Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The ceremony was photographed by Joe Rosenthal, who took the famous photograph "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima" during World War II. Another event was the public funeral of Church of Satan member and Naval Officer Edward Olson, as his wife had asked. The Church of Satan was in many books, magazine and newspaper articles in the 1960s and 1970s. A whole documentary, "Satanis" was also made about it in 1970. LaVey was also in Kenneth Anger’s film "Invocation of my Demon Brother", and helped as a technical adviser in "The Devil's Rain", which starred Ernest Borgnine, William Shatner, and first showed John Travolta. The Church of Satan was also shown in Luigi Scattini’s film "Angeli Bianchi, Angeli Neri", which in the United States was known as "Witchcraft ‘70". In 1975 LaVey argued within the Church of Satan by stopping the Church's “Grotto” system (having Satanic rituals in caves) and removing people he thought were using the Church instead of doing things in the outside world. After that, LaVey hoped success in society would decide who did well in the Church of Satan. LaVey chose to do less interviews. People thought the Church might have ended, or even that LaVey might have died. In the 1980s some Christians, therapists who believed in recovered memories, and the news were saying Satanists were a criminal group. Members of the Church of Satan, such as Peter H. Gilmore, Peggy Nadramia, Boyd Rice, Adam Parfrey, Diabolos Rex, and musician King Diamond, were active in the news to deny the Church of Satan were criminals. These stories became known as the Satanic panic. The FBI later made a report saying these conspiracy theories were untrue. In the 1980s and 1990s the Church of Satan made many movies, music, films, and magazines about Satanism. Adam Parfrey’s Feral House publishing, the music of Boyd Rice, and the films of Nick Bougas, including his documentary "Speak of the Devil: The Canon of Anton LaVey". They were also frequently in the newspapers. After Anton Szandor LaVey's death, his partner Blanche Barton became head of the Church of Satan. Barton is still in the Church; however, in 2001 she gave her position to long-time members Peter H. Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia, the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of "The Black Flame", the magazine of The Church of Satan. The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where the couple live. The Church of Satan does not recognize any other organizations as being Satanist though it does recognize that one does not need to be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist. Some public figures have been involved with the Church of Satan, including Kenneth Anger, King Diamond, Teresa Hidy, David Vincent, Marilyn Manson, Aaron Joehlin, Boyd Rice, Marc Almond, Alkaline Trio guitarist and singer Matt Skiba and drummer Derek Grant, professional wrestler Balls Mahoney, professional wrestler Sterling James Keenan, journalist Michael Moynihan, death metal guitarist Matthew McRaith, Sammy Davis Jr. and the artist Coop. As the Church of Satan does not let people see the membership records, it is not known how many members they have. In October 2004 the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist, twenty-four year old Chris Cranmer, as a technician on the HMS Cumberland. On June 6, 2006 The Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles. The ritual, based on The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals, was led by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz. In December 2007 the Associated Press reported that a teenager had sent an e-mail to the Church of Satan administration saying he wanted to "kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan." The Church told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the message, which then told local police who arrested the teenager. Membership. The Church of Satan has two types of members: Registered Members and Active Members. Registered Members just have to pay $200 to the Church, and are given a red card to show they are a member. An Active Member has to be involved with the Church and local members. Active Membership is divided into five Degrees: Active Members begin at the First Degree. They must be approved for an Active Membership, and this is based on their answers to a long list of questions. Members cannot apply for higher Degrees, and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public. Promotion to a higher degree is only by being invited. Members of the Third through Fifth degrees are the Priesthood and may be called "Reverend." Members of the Fifth degree are sometimes called "Doctor," although ""The" Doctor" usually means Lavey. Some Active Members are called Agents, qualified to explain the Church of Satan and the philosophy of Satanism to the media and others who are interested. People seeking membership must be old enough to be seen as adults in the country where they live. The only exception made is for children of members who show they understand the Church philosophy and practices who wish to join. What they can do is limited until they reach adulthood. Memberships may be ended through a decision of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess and the Council of Nine. Grottoes. Over the years, the Church of Satan has stopped then restarted the use of Grottoes -small groups for people who live near each other to work on projects or do ritual together, or be friends. Now that most people have the internet, the Church of Satan has decided people do not need to join Grottoes to meet other Satanists. If a group of Church of Satan members now wish to form a “magic circle” for something more than simple friendship and ritual, and can keep it active for a year and a day, the leader of the group can apply to have it called a Grotto and the leader called a Grotto Master. A grotto is expected to be secret, and only those they think are worthy are supposed to know about it. If a Grotto stops being useful it will be closed, as the Church of Satan has always done. Grotto Masters and Grottos do not represent the Church of Satan unless they have other authority to do so. Priesthood. Members of the Priesthood have the titles “Priest”/“Priestess,” “Magister”/“Magistra,” or “Magus”/“Maga.” The Council of Nine, which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan, and the Order of the Trapezoid who help in the administration of the Church of Satan are part of the priesthood. The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and the two main public representatives. The current High Priest is Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priestess Peggy Nadramia. The Church of Satan say they judge whether Active Members can join the Priesthood by their accomplishment in society and recognition within a profession rather than knowledge of the occult. They are expected to be able to speak about the Satanic philosophy, but do not have to represent the Church of Satan publicly, and might choose to keep their membership secret so they can do what they want in the world, meet their own goals and those of the Church. Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only. Past &amp; present Church of Satan High Priesthood. Zeena Lavey, Anton LaVey's daughter, was not a High Priestess of the Church and has left it. The main texts of LaVeyan Satanism. Satanists within the Church of Satan follow these rules on how to live. But Satanists do not view the Satanic sins, statements, and rules of the earth as things that someone has to "try" to do. They think it's human nature, rather than a Jew or Christian who the Church of Satan think have to try hard to fit in with the rules of their religion. The Nine Satanic Statements. The Nine Satanic Statements outline what "Satan" represents in the Church of Satan. Pentagonal Revisionism (Five-sided change). Pentagonal Revisionism is a plan consisting of five major goals written in 1988 by founder Anton Szandor LaVey: These goals have another purpose, as said by the author, to let non-Satanists see how much they agree with Satanic views. Pentagonal Revisionism is the application of Satanist beliefs to society and economics with five goals to encourage members. Other books, such as "The Satanic Bible", say more about Satanic dogma. = = = Kung Fu Panda (movie) = = = Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 American computer-animated action comedy movie made by DreamWorks.

However, about 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful peritonitis, and sepsis. Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis. Usually the infected appendix is taken out. The function of the appendix in apes is the digestion of vegetable matter such as leaves. Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus. Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our immune system does not serve it well. An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body. The causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or bacterial infections. If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock. Most serious appendicitis happens to younger children and elder adults. Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females. The most usual treatment is an appendectomy which means removing the appendix. Sometimes, it gets better without surgery. Some people think that eating vegetables will help, but no chances should be taken. "Seek medical advice" if in doubt. Reginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886. It is one of the leading causes worldwide of "pain in the abdomen", a term used in medicine and surgery to cover a wide range of causes. = = = Chandpur District = = = Chandpur (�������)is a district in east-central Bangladesh.

SWAT is an acronym that means Special Weapons And Tactics. Originally SWAT stood for Special Weapons ASSAULT Team but years later was changed when Public Relations realized Assault is a crime and had a negative connotation when these officers used excessive force. The original name has been very effectively swept from internet sources and is difficult to now find references apart from microfiche newspaper articles. SWAT officers carry weapons of higher caliber than most police officers do, such as machine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Usually, police departments use SWAT teams to catch people who sell illegal drugs or try to hold people hostage. They also respond to serious crimes like bank robberies when normal police officers cannot control the criminals. The first SWAT team was formed in Los Angeles in 1966 by Police Commissioner Daryl Gates in the wake of the 1965 Watts Riots. The SWAT teams are usually called to deal with hostage situations. They plan the entry into the building where the hostages are being held. They look closely at all building entrances to choose the best option. They make use of equipment such as rappelling ropes, night vision goggles, a tactical shield, flashbang and smoke grenades, snake cameras and small cameras that fit under doors and into very small holes, among others.

SWAT teams are called in when an incident presents significant risk to law enforcement officers or the public, as in: While all SWAT officers are expert marksmen with in-depth training in close combat, most play a specialized role within the team. Some serve as negotiators or medics while others are experts in handling assault vehicles or weapons. Each team includes several tactical officers who coordinate and carry out assaults on barricaded positions and catch and arrest armed suspects.

In the 2004 movie she is played by Emily Browning. In the TV series made in 2017-2018 she is played by Malina Weismann. = = = Flat Earth = = = The flat earth is a scientifically false hypothesis that the surface of the Earth is not roughly a sphere, but rather flat (a plane). Belief in a flat Earth is found in writings predating around 500 BC. Early Mesopotamian maps showed the world as a flat disk floating in the ocean. This was a common belief until the Classical Greeks began to discuss the Earth's shape about the 4th century BC. One of the "giveaways" is that ships' masts disappear as they move away from shore. Eratosthenes (276 –194 ) calculated the circumference of the Earth quite well. From then on, few educated people ever believed in its being flat, though the idea of a flat earth was still common among the less educated. Aristotle knew the Earth was round, that is to say, roughly spherical. (330 BC). The large-scale shape of the Earth only matters when considering large distances, as it is hard to see the Earth's curve from the ground. Therefore in the Ancient world only sailors, astronomers, philosophers, and theologians would have cared about the Earth's large-scale shape. The following authors argued for a spherical or ball-shaped earth: King Alfred of the Anglo-Saxons, Hildegard von Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Snorri Sturluson, Marco Polo, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus Portuguese people explored Africa and Asia, Columbus sailed to the Americas (1492) and Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated (sailed all round) the earth (1519-21). This proved finally, and in a practical way, that the Earth is a globe. During the 19th century, the Romantic ideas about a European "Dark Age" made the Flat Earth model look more important than it ever had been in history. In 1849, the Flat Earth movement was revived by Samuel Rowbotham, who wrote the book Zetetic Astronomy, which says that the results of his Bedford level experiment proved that the earth was flat. The widely circulated woodcut is of a man poking his head through the firmament of a flat Earth to see the machines working the spheres. It was made in 16th century style but cannot be traced to an earlier time than Camille Flammarion's "L'Atmosphère: Météorologie Populaire" (Paris, 1888, p. 163). The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a missionary in the middle Ages claimed that "he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met". That story may be traced back to Voltaire, but not to any known source in the Middle ages. The original woodcut had a decorative border that places it in the 19th century; in later publications, some claimed that the woodcut dated from the 16th century and the border was removed. According to an unproved story Flammarion ordered the woodcut himself; certainly no source of the image earlier than Flammarion's book is known. An early mention in literature was Ludvig Holberg's comedy "Erasmus Montanus" (1723). A great many people disagree with Erasmus Montanus when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants believe it is flat. He is not allowed to marry his fiancée until he cries "The earth is flat as a pancake". In Rudyard Kipling's "The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat", the main characters spread the rumor that a Parish Council meeting had voted in favor of a flat Earth. Myth. The myth of the flat Earth, or the flat earth error, is a modern wrong idea. It says that European scholars and educated people during the Middle Ages believed the Earth to be flat. They did not. Fantasy fiction. Fantasy fiction often imagines a flat Earth. In C. S. Lewis' "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" the fictional world of Narnia is "round like a table" (i.e., flat), not "round like a ball", and the characters sail toward the edge of this world. Terry Pratchett's Strata and Discworld novels (1983 onwards) are set on a flat, disc-shaped world resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle. = = = John Gilbert (bushranger) = = = John Gilbert (1842 – 1865) was a famous Australian bushranger. He was born in Hamilton, Canada. He came to Australia in 1852 when he was 10 years old. His family came to dig gold in Victoria, Australia. When he was 12 years old he got a job working with horses When he was about 20 years old, Gilbert was living in New South Wales near Forbes. He became a member of a gang which was led by Frank Gardiner. Another member of the gang was Ben Hall. With Gardiner and Hall, Gilbert was involved with the biggest gold robbery in Australia's history: in 1862 the gang robbed a coach carrying gold at Eugowra. After the robbery, Gardiner went to Queensland to hide from the police. John Gilbert went to New Zealand. When he came back in May 1863, he started a new gang with Ben Hall. With Ben Hall. The Ben Hall gang robbed travelers on the roads, the mail coaches, the gold escorts, hotels, farm houses and even held up whole towns. The police seemed to be unable to stop the gang. At first people thought this was fun, the police being made to look like fools. Gilbert and John O'Meally did the first daylight bank robbery in Australia in July 1863. They rode into the town of Carcoar and tried to take money from the bank. The man working at the bank grabbed his gun and fired it twice. Gilbert and O'Meally ran out of the bank, quickly got on to their horses and rode away. But as the number of robberies continued, people became scared and wanted the government to do something. In 1864, Gilbert killed a policeman, Sergeant Edmund Parry, during a robbery near Jugiong. The police search for Gilbert became urgent. At Springfield, near Goulburn, Gilbert tried to rob four young brothers. The boys fired their guns and kept the bushrangers back. Gilbert tried to shoot one of the boys, but his stolen race horse (called "Young Waverly") got in the way. The horse died immediately and Gilbert was trapped under the dead horse. People thought that this was very funny; a dangerous bushranger being made to look like a fool by a group of boys. In 1865 another another policeman was killed by another member of the gang, John Dunn. Members of the gang were declared outlaws. This meant they could be killed by anyone at anytime. The police killed Ben Hall near Forbes on May 5, 1865. On May 13, 1865 Gilbert and Dunn went to hide at John Kelly's (Dunn's grandfather) house. Kelly told the police at Binalong where the two bushrangers were hiding so he could get the reward money. The police went to the house, but Gilbert and Dunn climbed out a window and ran down to Billabong Creek to escape into the bush. Constable King and Dunn were both shot. Gilbert was shot and killed when he stopped to shoot back at Constable John Bright. After an inquest to record how he died, he was buried at Binalong in the field where the police kept their horses. Gilbert was a bad criminal. He had been in 630 robberies. Dunn escaped but was captured six months later. He was hanged in Sydney in March 1866. Gilbert in poetry and song.

It affects how people think and act. People with ADHD may have trouble sitting still, being quiet, or sleeping. They may be rather impulsive. They usually have problems focusing and remembering what is said or done around them. ADHD is called a "neurological developmental disorder" because it affects how people's nervous systems develop. Experts think that, throughout the world, about one in twenty children (5%) have ADHD. Some countries have more people with ADHD than others, and not everyone uses the same tests. Psychologists have found more people with ADHD in North America than in Africa and the Middle East. In the United States, about one in every fourteen children has ADHD (7%), including one in every ten boys (10%) and one in every twenty-five girls (4%). This could be because more boys get ADHD, or because fewer girls take ADHD tests. ADHD is most diagnosed in children and especially in boys. However, it is not uncommon for teenagers or adults to be diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD has no cure which means it is permanent. However, people with ADHD can treat it which means to help them get better. The difference between a cure and treatment is a cure entirely removes a problem, while the treatment does not remove the problem but help make the symptoms go away as if you don't have ADHD. Signs and symptoms. People with ADHD can have trouble paying attention, be overly active, or be impulsive. There are three types of ADHD, based on which of the three symptoms is most common. Someone who usually has trouble paying attention may have some or all of these symptoms: Someone who usually is overly active may have some or all of these symptoms: People who are overly active usually lose these symptoms as they get older. Someone who usually is impulsive may have some or all of these symptoms: People with ADHD may have trouble making and keeping friends. They may also have trouble controlling their anger. While children with ADHD may have trouble doing some things, many children with ADHD will not have trouble paying attention to something they enjoy or think is interesting. Most people who have ADHD also have other mental disorders, most often oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, dyslexia, Tourette syndrome, anxiety disorders (especially obsessive-compulsive disorder), mood disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders (especially antisocial, borderline, histrionic, passive-aggressive and avoidant). Cause. It is believed that the main difference between neurotypical brains and the ones with ADHD is the deficit in the amount of dopamine receptors within the synapses in the brain. This deficit is said to be the main factor in regulating motivation and sustaining attention. Research of twins has shown that about three in four cases of ADHD are caused by one or both parents having ADHD. Siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder. Genetic factors are also believed to be involved in determining whether ADHD lasts into adulthood. Some scientists think that ADHD is common because when humans were first developing, it was good to be overly active. Others think that, because ADHD is more common in children when the mother is anxious, ADHD developed to help children in dangerous places. There are other possible causes for ADHD. If a pregnant person drinks alcohol, it can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which can include ADHD. ADHD can also happen if a mother smokes tobacco while she is pregnant. Lead, low birth weight, premature birth, and some infections can increase the risk of a child having ADHD. Managing ADHD. There is no cure for ADHD. People with ADHD can be helped with therapy or medication. Therapy is recommended for children who do not have bad symptoms or are very young. Therapy for people with ADHD helps with attention and behavior. There is also education for parents and teachers to help children with ADHD. Some physical exercise has been shown to help people with ADHD. Generally, its treatment is categorized into two categories i.e. pharmacological and nonpharmacological. The first line treatment for ADHD includes cognitive behavioral therapy and use of stimulants. While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) programs were once thought to be the solution for working with ADHD children and getting them to slow down and think, sadly, CBT programs have not been proven to be an efficient strategy for working with ADHD populations. Stimulants increase the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain, which helps with paying attention, planning, organization, and management of being overly active. These medications should not be given to children below the age of 6. Society and culture. People do not agree about the diagnosis of ADHD. The number of people with ADHD has increased in the last several years. Some people think this is because doctors are diagnosing too many people. Others think it is because doctors are getting better at finding people with ADHD. Some people think that ADHD is made up and not a real illness, even though it's the most researched condition in psychiatry. area of Gunma Prefecture on the island of Honshū. It is also known as or .

Mechanical combination locks usually have a dial that is rotated to three different numbers (four numbers on some safe locks) to open the lock. Electronic combination locks usually have a keypad where the combination can be entered like a telephone number. Mechanical combination lock. The mechanical combination lock usually has three discs inside. The last disc is connected directly to the dial, and a notch on this disc rotates the second disc. A notch on the second disc in turn rotates the first disc. The lock is usually opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first number, counterclockwise past the first number and to the second number, and clockwise to the third number (some locks use the reverse directions, and most safe locks require a return to 0 after entering the combination). This type of lock is popular on safes and padlocks. It is available for entry doors, but is not popular due to the amount of time required to enter the combination. The combination is usually set at the factory and can not be changed easily (if at all). Electronic keypad lock. The electronic combination lock uses a keypad that looks similar to a telephone keypad. The combination is entered one number at a time, like a telephone number. When the number is entered, a motor opens the lock. This type of lock is popular on safes and doors, but is almost never seen on padlocks. These locks require batteries or another source of electricity. There is sometimes a key backup in case the batteries die or the electronics fail. Most safe locks do not have a key backup, as a key backup can be picked. Most electronic locks allow the user to set the combination. Advantages. Combination locks can not be picked (as long as there is no key backup), and the user does not have to carry a key. There is little chance of getting locked out as long as the user is good at remembering the combination. Disadvantages. Mechanical combination locks can be difficult to use for people who have never used one before. The most common mistakes are forgetting to pass the first number when dialing the second number, and rotating the dial backwards. In an electronic combination lock, the batteries can die, preventing the lock from opening until the batteries are replaced. With most combination locks, it is possible for a thief to obtain the combination by watching a legitimate user entering it. On an electronic combination lock, a thief can sometimes guess the combination based on the amount of wear on the buttons. An example of worn buttons can be seen in the photo on the right. More-modern keypad locks require the user to press one or two other buttons indicated by LEDs after the combination is entered. This causes the other buttons that are not part of the combination to wear down as well, preventing a thief from determining which numbers are part of the combination based on wear marks. = = = Jeff Cardoni = = = Jeffrey E.

It includes a large amount of sugar and vegetable oil, with a mild cinnamon flavor. It has characteristics of both pound cake and coffee cake. The flavor of the finished product can be changed by not using cinnamon. A common recipe using this starter uses one cup (240 ml) of it to make bread. A second cup is saved to start a new cycle. The remaining two cups are given to friends. The process of sharing the starter makes it somewhat like a chain letter. One cup of starter makes one standard loaf of bread. It can also be called German friendship cake, or "Herman" the German friendship cake. The starter mix can be made from a recipe of flour, water and yeast. One cup of the mixture is then passed to other people who get instructions on how to keep it alive, usually just saying to give it more ingredients as time passes. = = = Shimotsuke Province = = = is an old province of Japan in the area of Tochigi Prefecture on the island of Honshū.

It was the first game in the popular Zork trilogy and was released for a wide range of computer systems, followed by "Zork II" and "Zork III". It was Infocom's first game, and sold more than 400,000 copies. Plot. The player steps into the role of an "adventurer". The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is not given any instructions, the house is point of interest. When the player enters the house through a window, it yields a number of interesting objects: an ancient brass lantern, an empty trophy case, an intricately engraved sword, etc. Beneath a rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar. But what appears the cellar is actually one of several entrances to an underground area—the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters dangerous creatures, including deadly grues, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops and a nimble-fingered thief. The goal of "Zork I" is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and place them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two difficult mazes and some precise controls at Flood Control Dam #3. Placing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of "Master Adventurer." An ancient map with further instructions then appears in the trophy case. These instructions provide access to a stone barrow. The entrance to the barrow is the end of "Zork I" and the beginning of "Zork II". It is possible to score all 350 points in 223 moves (and win the game completely in 228 moves) by exploiting a bug. = = = Zork II = = = Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz is an interactive fiction video game published by Infocom in 1981.

It is Infocom's second game. Plot. The player starts in the Barrow from Zork I armed only with the brass lantern and the elvish sword. The purpose of the game is not initially clear. The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a good sorcerer, but when his powers began to go away he was exiled by Lord Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on insanity, the wizard is a force to be reckoned with. Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's area, is to avoid his tricks and learn to control his magic. Like its predecessor, "Zork II" is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, and finding all the treasures is not needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale. = = = Nature versus nurture = = = The nature versus nurture debate is about the causes of differences between people. The phrase 'nature versus nurture' was suggested by the Victorian polymath Francis Galton. He was influenced by Darwin's "On the Origin of Species". He investigated the influence of heredity and environment on social advancement. Galton did not oppose nature to nurture as two alternatives. The phrase 'nature vs nurture' has been criticized for its over-simplification. Almost all writers have realised that both play a part in our make-up. Both nature and nurture play interacting roles in development, and many modern psychologists and anthropologists think the contrast is too simple. = = = Ramin Djawadi = = = Ramin Djawadi (born July 19, 1974) is a German-Iranian composer of orchestral music for movies and television.

They only have relative, subjective value according to viewpoint and circumstances. Common statements that might be considered relativistic include: There are many forms of relativism. The term often refers to "truth relativism", which is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism). As "moral relativism", moral principles apply only in a limited context. In context, principles and ethics do hold; out of context they do not. There are similar ideas in nihilism, scepticism and amoralism. Various applications. People who agreed with the idea of relativism include Paul Feyerabend, Isaiah Berlin and Richard Rorty. The Roman Catholic Church, especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today. The Church and some philosophers define relativism as the denial of absolute truth. They say that without absolute truth, there can be no moral values. If there are no moral values, there might not be sin, and God may not exist. In their view, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle and Plato) consists of "adequatio rei et intellectus", the correspondence of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality. The denial of an absolute reference, of an "axis mundi," denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian philosophers. They link relativism to secularism, an obstruction of religion in human life. Pope Leo XIII (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical Humanum Genus (1884). Leo XIII condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism. = = = Federica De Bortoli = = = Federica De Bortoli (born November 9, 1976 in Rome) is an Italian voice actress.

She works at LaBibi.it, Dubbing Brothers, Sefit - CDC, and other dubbing studios in Italy. = = = Cheese analogue = = = Cheese analogues are substitutes of cheese that are made to imitate the taste and the look of real cheese. Such substitutes replace the dairy milk by other plant-based ingredients. The fat in the milk is replaced by other kinds of fat of animal or plant origin. Sometimes the proteins found in milk are also replaced by proteins from other sources. Cheese analogues are usually used because of health reasons, for example lactose intolerance. They are also used as a personal choice (e.g. veganism, or for religious reasons). In most cases, Cheese analogue is kosher. Cheese analogue cost less to make than real cheese. By carefully choosing the ingredients in the analogue, other characteristics such as the melting temperature and the taste can be changed. Flavour enhancers can be added to make the product taste similar to Parmesan, feta or Camembert cheese, for example. Food coloring is used to match the color of a cheese product. Real cheese undergoes a ripening process, cheese analogues do not have this: Usually, vegetable oil is heated, and mixed with a premade powder and water. Flavour enhancers are added. After cooling, the product is ready for packaging. In Europe, cheese analogue is used for gastronomy and in bakeries; In the United States, it is marketed as a replacement for real cheese. The arguments used cater to people who do not want to use real cheese for personal reasons, or that cannot use it for health reasons. = = = Perla Liberatori = = = Perla Liberatori (born November 10, 1981 in Rome) is an Italian voice actress.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Rikuzen Province were reformed in the 1870s. = = = Danger = = = Danger (also risk or peril) is the possibility of something bad happening. A situation in which there is a risk of something bad happening, is called "dangerous", "risky" or "perilous". People often take risks, or do things that might hurt them. An example of this is crossing the road without looking carefully. There is a risk that you might get hit by a car. Anything that involves a risk of injury or to health can be described as dangerous. Smoking is dangerous to health. Being around some animals is dangerous because they might attack humans. Measuring danger. There are a few different ways that danger can be "quantified" - put into numbers. Probability. probability measures how dangerous something is. It uses a math equation to find the risk that a certain event might happen. In epidemiology, risk is defined as the number of events that "did" happen, divided by the number of events that "could have" happened. For example, if the risk of babies dying after birth in a population is reported as 1/1000, it means that out of every 1000 babies born, 1 is likely to die. Risk and prevalence. Prevalence is the number of people in a population that have a certain disease. Risk is the number of "new" cases of disease, divided by the number of people who "could" get the disease. For example, during an outbreak of the flu, risk would be the number of people who get the flu, divided by the number of people who were exposed to the flu virus. Risk assessment. A risk assessment is a list of things that could go wrong. In many Western countries, when teachers take children on an outing, they may have to fill in a risk assessment form which lists the possible dangers and says what they should do to stop bad things from happening (e.g. accidents or children getting lost). = = = Dangerous = = = Dangerous describes something that has danger. It can also mean: = = = Cadet = = = A cadet is someone who is training to become an officer in the military, often a person who is a junior trainee. The term comes from the term "cadet" for younger sons of a noble family. = = = Cognitive dissonance = = = Cognitive dissonance is a concept in social psychology. It is the discomfort felt by a person who holds conflicting ideas, beliefs or values at the same time. In this state, people may feel surprise, dread, guilt, anger, or embarrassment. Reacting to this unpleasant state, people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance was developed to predict and explain how people reacted to this situation. Cognitive dissonance theory says that people have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality. According to Festinger, people engage in a process he termed "dissonance reduction". This can be got in one of three ways: People in dissonance may change their feelings, thoughts or memories so they are less in conflict. However, often they do not, and instead set out to manipulate the social scene around them so that their embarrassment is less. For example, they may try to explain away the dissonance with a wider theory or they may intensify their efforts at persuasion and publicity so that others join them in their beliefs. Case study. Festinger's book "When Prophecy Fails" is the story of how a cult leader reacted when her prophecy of doom failed. Festinger and his associates read an interesting item in their local newspaper: "Prophecy from planet Clarion call to city: flee that flood". The prophecy came from Dorothy Martin (1900–1992), a Chicago housewife who experimented with automatic writing. She had previously been involved with L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics movement, and her cult incorporated ideas from what was to become Scientology. The group of believers had taken steps which showed their commitment to the belief. They had left jobs, college, and spouses, and had given away money and possessions. They prepared for their departure on a flying saucer, which was to rescue the group of true believers. She claimed to have received a message from a fictional planet named Clarion. These messages revealed that the world would end in a great flood before dawn on December 21, 1954. After the failure of the prediction, Dorothy Martin left Chicago after being threatened with arrest and involuntary commitment. She later founded the Association of Sananda and Sanat Kumara. Under the name 'Sister Thedra', she continued to practice channeling and to participate in contactee groups until her death in 1992. The Association is active to this day. Sequence of events. Festinger and his colleagues infiltrated Martin's group and reported the following sequence of events: The experiences supported the idea that the group did have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality. In fact, events had proved conclusively the falsehood of their ideas, but the group rearranged their explanations to give themselves the least psychological pain. = = = Lime (material) = = = Lime is a general term for various naturally occurring minerals and materials derived from them in which carbonates, oxides and hydroxides of calcium predominate. These materials are used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including limestone products, concrete, and mortar), and as chemical feedstocks, among other uses. The rocks and minerals from which these materials are derived, primarily limestone and chalk, are composed primarily of calcium carbonate. "Burning" (calcination) converts them into the highly caustic material "quicklime" (calcium oxide), and, through the addition of water, into the less caustic, but still strongly alkaline "slaked lime" (calcium hydroxide). In general writing when the term is used in an agricultural context it probably refers to Agricultural lime. Otherwise it most commonly means slaked lime, as the more dangerous form is usually described more specifically as quicklime or "burnt lime". = = = Permineralization = = = Permineralization is a process of fossilization in which mineral deposits form internal casts of organisms. Minerals in water fill the spaces inside organic tissue. The process gives a record of soft tissue as well as hard tissues. Fossils with permineralization are useful in studying internal structures, especially of plants. Water from the ground, lakes, or oceans seeps into the pores of organic tissue and forms a crystal cast with deposited minerals. Crystals begin to form in the porous cell walls. This process continues on the inner surface of the walls until the central cavity of the cell, the lumen, is completely filled. The cell walls themselves remain intact surrounding the crystals. Permineralization is different from petrification in that the organic material is only filled with minerals and not completely replaced. Permineralization can occur in several ways: Types. Silicification. Silicification is the most common type of permineralization. Carbonate mineralization. Carbonate mineralization occurs as coal balls. Coal balls are fossilizations of plants and their tissues, usually made when there is seawater or acidic peat. This type of fossilization gives information about plant life in the Upper Carboniferous (325 to 280 million years ago). Pyritization. Organisms are pyritized when they are in marine sediments saturated with iron sulfides. = = = MTR Corporation = = = MTR Corporation Limited is a public transport operator in Hong Kong. = = = Battle of Plassey = = = The Battle of Plassey was a major battle that took place on 23 June 1757 at Palashi, Bengal. It was an important British East India Company victory over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies. It was part of the Third Carnatic War, and of the worldwide Seven Years' War in which France and its allies fought Britain and its allies. British victory let the British East India Company take control of the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. In the next hundred years their area of control grew over the rest of India. The battle took place at Plassey, Bengal on the river banks of the Bhagirathi-Hooghly River, a distributary of the Ganges. The fighting took place about north of Calcutta. This was near Murshidabad which was the capital of Bengal at the time. Plassey is the anglicised version of Palashi. The battle was between Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, and the British East India Company. The Nawab of Bengal at the period was Siraj-ud-daulah. He: The following reasons also led to immense anger to the Company causing it declare was over the Bengal Nawabs. The battle took place after the attack and plunder of Calcutta by Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole of Calcutta tragedy. The troubles between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British led to the Battle of Plassey. First, the British had strengthened the fortification around the Fort William without telling the Nawab. Secondly, they abused the trade privileges granted to them by the Mughal rulers, which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government. Third, they gave shelter to some of his officers, for example Krishnadas, son of Rajballav, who fled Dhaka after misappropriating government funds. Hence, when the East India Company started further enhancement of military preparedness at Fort William in Calcutta, Siraj asked them to stop. The Company did not stop, so Siraj-ud Daulah retaliated and captured Kolkata (Shortly renamed as Alinagar) from the British in June 1756. The Nawab gathered his forces together and took Fort William. The British sent more soldiers under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal. The British retook control of Calcutta. Clive then took control of the French fort of Chandernagar. The battle was fought during the Seven Years' War (1756–63). The French East India Company sent a small group to fight against the British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had more soldiers and chose to fight at Plassey. The British were worried about having fewer soldiers. They formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army leader Mir Jafar as well as others such as Yar Lutuf Khan and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan brought their soldiers near Plassey but did not actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army was beaten by about 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, and Siraj-ud-daulah fled from the battlefield. This is thought to be one of the most important battles for the control of the Indian subcontinent by the colonial powers. The British now had influence over the Nawab. They also got a lot of revenue from trade. The British used this revenue to increase their military power. They pushed the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia. This was a sign of the expansion the British Empire in Asia. As a reward for his treachery, Mir Jafar was made the Nawab of Bengal. Former Nawab Mutsheed Kiki Khan directed all landowners of Bangla, Bihar and odisa a not to sell any plot of lands to British East India Company. = = = Txillardegi = = = José Luis Álvarez Enparantza (27 September 1929 – 14 January 2012) was a Basque linguist, politician and writer.
