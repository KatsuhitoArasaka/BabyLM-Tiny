there erm there who's er just doesn't even know why they're ring that would be quite nice. Simon why are you calling? Well the other day somebody asked me to sign a petition about date rape Yep. you reminded me of that. They the petition said that there is no difference between rape and date rape. Mm. And er I was standing there I wasn't really sure whether I should sign it. Erm you know I thought thought but I'm not sure if there is a difference. I think there is a difference. I'm sure there's a difference. I'm sure there are there you know there's there is ordinary nasty horrid aggressive rape when you're you're you know like somebody's attacked from behind or something down a a dark alley. And then there is a different thing called date rape but there is no excuse for either I don't think. Well I'm not sure about that either. I mean certainly there's the horrid sort of thing that happens on date rape Mm. and you know with violence and that and then as you work your way along there'd be the sort of situation where there isn't any physical violence but there's intimidation and fear Yep. fear of violence and I think that's that's definitely out of order. And then you get you work your way along and you get to the situation where erm the woman is pressured by feelings of embarrassment or social pressure not to say no. And that's when I think it starts to get into into shady ground where where the woman hasn't actually said no because she feels intimidated not by violence but by social pressure. That's I mean that's maybe more the fault of society than it is the fault of the of the man that's involved. And then you get into the situations apparently where erm people decide after they've had sex Mm. that they didn't enjoy it and therefore it must have been rape cos they didn't wa they didn't like it. Erm and then I think you've you've clearly gone outside the definition of rape or outside you know a reasonable Yeah I would agree with that but I don't think there is er any excuse for a woman to or a man for that matter to say women deserve rape says M P's wife . Oh no I mean he's g he's gotta go hasn't he? I mean if if a woman undresses okay let's take a scenario okay Simon maybe er you know you could put yourself in the same situation All right. been out with a woman's erm undressed in front of you you know you've done the bit you've er you've managed to er within three easy steps undo the bra with one hand whilst er telling her you know you're a really nice guy and there's no chance of going too far and all that sort of thing and you know you get you get fairly carried away you may even be under the sheets Yeah. you may even and this is a bit I mean Saturday lunchtime is a bit I'm almost almost er oh the producer's going, Careful careful, which he should know is a red flag to a bull and I might say no but I won't. Er so maybe you're both even under the covers naked all right Mm mm. okay and then there're there're bits of your body that are are are you know your your your whole being is stirring Could be a bit hard to stop. It could be very hard to stop. Mm. So er as soon as the girl turns to you and says, Right I don't want to go any further that's it. Well it's it's annoying at that point. It's very annoying but that's when you have to stop . but you do have to stop but that isn't to say it isn't very annoying. Okay. But if you were to carry on and the woman was screaming no no no no get off get off get off, as far as I'm concerned that's rape. That is yeah. But I think there's some there's some grey areas in there. there are but I mean it's it's silly for people to say once a man is sexually aroused it's quite difficult to stop isn't it? Well it is difficult to stop. I'm I'm surprised they haven't got rid of cynics already actually Mm. Erm Well he's not in he's out today he's out he and his wife are out cos we put a phone call in we said let's have a chat with him We were just going to ask him about this proposed pay rise that's all. This thing that that er his wife said about some women deserve it Mm. Funnily enough though there are there are feminist women who are who are saying similar things that saying that it is a bit irresponsible to have gotten into bed with someone and taken all your clothes off and then say no. Yeah but But as you say you at that point you do have to stop. How many though how many men have and you remember, I can just remember, I mean just you know the the sort of, Well look er you know it doesn't mean I won't respect you and I don't love you and all that sort of thing. Er I'm not sure I share your experience there You see and er I mean er are you sure you don't want and er. We can be persuasive Mm. but there has to be a time when no is no. Just have to avoid being intimidated. Yes you're right. Simon thanks for calling. All right then. Bye. Bye. I don't know if I want to talk about this on a Saturday lunchtime I tell you Dan I mean it really is it's erm What are you doing? I've thought of something. Oh have you. What have you thought of? That silly judge who erm Oh. said that he's no angel do you remember that case ? Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah . He's done it again. Has he done it again? He hasn't still working. I'm I'm surprised at that hang on er we've got Mark on yellow what number is yellow twenty two. Hello Mark Hello. Hi where are you? In Scarborough. Okay hang on then Mark. Have you found it? Not yet. Okay well look for it. Yes Mark? I'm completely against Halloweening. You are? Yep. Well you must be one of the very few I would have thought Mark. Well I'm sick of it cos you see every year we get little kids coming round to our houses asking for trick or treat Yeah. and I live in a place where there's a lot of old people and they come round to us and they tell us they've been scared the night after Mm. they tell us how scared they are and I don't like listening to it I getting sick of it now. You don't like listening to who? Well the old people complain that they've been scared. Like we get big gangs of kids coming round. Why to they complain to you Mark? Well we're friendly with them all. Friendly with who? All the neighbours. Oh I see right. Yeah. Erm well we're just sick of them. We get loads of kids coming round big gangs of kids scaring everyone. I mean they do it just don't make an effort they just come round demanding money. Mm. Well the best thing is a bucket of cold water by the door. No I jest it's not a good idea. Erm yeah well there we are I mean I I you're just talking to somebody who's converted really Mark I mean I think it's a waste of time it's er it's a sort of pagan festival Yes. it's a copy of something in America. There's nothing worse than when you're at home you don't want people banging unannounced on the door saying trick or treat . Because I know what I'm going to say to any kids who have the audacity to come to my house which they won't but erm and I'm sure a lot of people do so the rest of the year we we're encouraging children not to approach strangers and everything else and then this one day of the year or maybe two days or maybe the whole run-up from now until November the fifth you've got kids begging on the street penny for the guy and all that sort of thing. Yes. It's just a mockery. It's a mockery. Disgusting. Well if they come round to ours this year I'll invite them in I'll take them to my basement and I'll lock 'em up for a few days. Well joking apart that's the sort of thing that could happen to kids and er you you know you wonder why parents let them out. Take 'em around somewhere like Michael Sands's house. Yeah we can't really turn him up he's fully up actually. Sorry I can't turn you up. Why is all that noise going on behind you ? Me? Cos I'm at Scarborough seafront. You're at Scarborough seafront. Yeah. In a phone box? No. Mobile phone. What? Selling ice-creams. Oh selling ice-creams Yes. Yeah is it busy there at the moment? Not bad. Cos it's pretty miserable outside isn't it customers waiting but there you go. Have you? Yeah. You give the phone to the next customer. Who's the next customer. Next customer's the lady waiting here. Let me talk to her. Do you want to talk to her? Yeah. Excuse me. Do you want to talk to James Whale on the radio? Who? Do you want to talk to him? He wants to talk to you. Don't you? No one wants to speak to you. Well make her speak. What did you tell her it was me for that's a putter-off for a start. Why didn't you just thrust the phone into her hand? They're all scared you know. Are they? Yep. Yeah. Are they they they your regular customers? Well not really. I see. And they know what you're doing at the moment do they whilst you're not serving them ice-cream . illicit phone calls. Oh you're make illicit phone calls. I've been listening to your programme all morning so. I see. I'll have to go. Okay watch how you go. Bye. Bye. Fancy telling them it's me no wonder it's going to put off. Er the judge who said an eight year old sex victim was no angel, you remember the one of course, yesterday freed two men who had intercourse with a thirteen year old. They he freed two men. Ian heard from police that the girl was more like Mandy Smith than the proverbial school girl and gave both men conditional discharges. He then told the court I had better not say she was an angel or no angel or the national press will have a hundred field days. She was a girl trying to find young men to satisfy her sexual desires. He added, I have to pass a sentence because it is against the law. It would be folly to pass a custodial sentence whatever the Court of Appeal may think. The seventy one year old judge caused uproar in June when he said an eight year old victim of a sex attack was not entirely an angel herself. He gave student Karl two years probation for attempted unlawful sexual intercourse. The Court of Appeal increased his sentence to four months jail yesterday. Judge Hill gave two year conditional discharges to Philip twenty one from Southampton and Keith nineteen of nearby Hythe for unlawful intercourse. Now I don't know because you know there's a photograph in that story of Mandy Smith as well and er Mandy Smith looked like Mandy Smith from about the age of fourteen. Erm any views? You might give us a call O nine O four six four one six four one. John is er on blue on blue on blue on blue twenty three John hello. Hello John? Hello John Good after good afternoon. Got you John yes John. Yes. Hi. Hello. Er you're on John. Yes. You're on the air John. Your turn John. Good afternoon. I beg your pardon John. Do you want to hear my opinions about er what we spoke about yesterday? Er you were on about ye I spoke yesterday about Halloween. Oh did you it wasn't me but yes go on you you feel free . Must have been somebody else. Okay well er there are seem one I mean is it worth it? You might as well children isn't it might as well go home. Yes John. Hello. Hello. What's going on? Haven't a clue John we're all mad aren't we? Well some of us. I'll take a lead from you. Anyway John you go on. Right. Yeah. You still there? Yes I'm here John. You all right? Good good good good. Right. I keep hearing funny noises Yes I do. Yes. Must be Halloween or Yeah. supposed to be Let me get that right again John you said you keep hearing funny noises. Yeah. that you silly Ooh! I lie in here. I don't know I don't know you should've Have you got your hands sort of tied up behind you in that sort of coat thing? I haven't got anything. Haven't you I have. Oh right. All right. Have we stopped playing er are we are we serious now? Are you serious? Yeah. Good that's all it needs is one of us to be serious and we're okay. Right. John. Hallow You're on the air yeah. Yes Halloween. Right you were talking about its affect on children Mm. and er I've discussed this before and I've come to the conclusion that these children who come along with Jehovah's Witnesses knocking on your door they're more affected than any child once a year practising whatever you like to call it Halloween or whatever. That was basically my argument. So excuse me for being a little thick. Yes. I didn't I what what d'ya mean? Well when the Jehovah's and the other religious cults come knocking at the door with their various pamphlet and trying to persuade you that their religion is better than others Yeah. they have these very young children with them Yeah. and er I think they're more affected by outside influences brainwash whatever you like to call it than one night a year of Halloween. Yeah well okay er possibly but er I think you're missing the point actually. I mean Halloween is it's a pagan ritual it's there to worship the devil it's the most poignant date in the calendar if you want to get into black magic if you want to dance naked round er a sheep's heart with sticks stuck through it. Hey hey I say all these kids are doing is walking round with a bloody turnip with a candle in it. They're not learning about religion where they don't believe in blood transfusions etcetera etcetera seven or eight year old. Yes but I think you know you have to give Go on. You have to give a little bit of er credibility there for people not being quite that dim don't you? Not quite that dim? Well I mean we we're not really er . If Jehovah's Witnesses come to the door Yes. you know what it's all about. Okay? You either let them in for two reasons. You let them in to have a laugh at them or you let them in because you want to listen to what they're saying. Okay? Yes. You cannot put that together with Halloween which basically is people going out thinking they're going out to have fun and they're having a bit of a laugh and everything else where's there's their underlying er connection with the devil. I don't think children realize it is a connection with the devil But isn't isn't that the most dangerous thing? No no I think the consistent and persistent influence in the children which some of these religious cults have I think that's more dangerous than one one two nights of a candle in a in a turnip or whatever. Yes but could they not be brainwashed if you like into thinking well there's nothing much wrong there isn't such a thing as evil No no. You don't think so ? evil isn't there? Well of course there's evil yeah. And I think pretend there isn't evil. Okay thank you for your call John. Okay. You enjoyed that didn't you? Be honest. Well Yeah be honest you enjoyed it . interesting talking to er A nut case I know exactly how you feel. Different opinions. Thank you John. Okay bye bye. Bye bye. Er right thank you John. Erm go back up here. Now we've got Sir Frederick erm I can't see the Sir Frederick Lawton retired senior judge on the phone. Sir Frederick good erm afternoon to you. Good afternoon. Er we really wanted to know what your view on erm Sir Nicholas Fairburn's outburst both in the Commons I suppose and er reported the outburst of his wife on the front page of the Daily Mirror today. Well I haven't seen that outburst but er I understand that he suggested Could I read it to you? Yes please . Sor let me read. First of all the headline says,Women deserve rape says M P's wife , and then the front page exclusive,Many women deserve to be raped a Tory M P's wife said yesterday. Sir Nicholas Fairburn's wife Sam backed her husband's astonishing views that there is no such crime as rape . Well that's absolute rubbish. I've had I think more experience of what a rape in court than Sir Nicholas. He may have had more experience outside court than I have because I've had none. But in court I have probably dealt with more rape cases than any other living lawyer. And my experience has been that virtually all rape cases have been the forcible interference with a woman. So why do you think Sir Nicholas and his wife have both come out and said something as ridiculous as this? They also go on to say that a lot of women deserve to be raped. Well that again is nonsense. There is unfortunately a theory around which is of long standing to that effect. I presided over a the Criminal Law Revision Committee when we reviewed the law relating to rape and we discovered that there was this myth that women asked for rape. It is a myth. Why in in that case do you think that Sir Nicholas and he he he's not stupid, I mean he's a career politician, he's come out and said this his wife has said that they're both smiling on the front page of the newspaper at the moment and they go on to say it's not fair on a man if a women undresses and then changes her mind. Well that may it may be unfair and until recently that kind of situation never came before the courts. There has unfortunately in my opinion been a change of attitude about which cases to prosecute Mm. and in some of these cases there ought not to be a prosecution. But that doesn't mean that the ordinary case is one in which the woman is in any way asking to be raped. Now Sir Frederick, recently the police have made great strides forward in encouraging women to come and report rape because until recently they didn't and they didn't want to they didn't want to face the shame and they didn't want to face everything else, Sir Nicholas and and again his wife which is the most worrying I think of this a women saying that that that women deserve to be raped, erm it's going to make women less likely to come forward isn't it? Well i I agree. But again I think it has been unfortunate er er that recently there have been a few cases in which it would have been better not to prosecute Mhm. but they are a minority of cases. In most cases that I've dealt with and I've f I repeat I've probably dealt with more than any other living person in court, er there has been a clear case of rape. Could I move on from that Sir Frederick just to ask you whilst you're on the phone your views on er the story in the Daily Mail today. Er Judge Ian I'm sure you'll be familiar with him he is the judge who I I know him personally. Right. Er he said or he's in a in a in a little trouble today for allowing two men who had sex of thirteen to go free erm a policeman told the judge that the thirteen year old was more like Mandy Smith than the proverbial school girl with pigtails but she was nevertheless thirteen and the judge said he had better not say she was no angel or the national press would have a hundred field days with him. Is there not some call on judges to be just a little a a little more respectful perhaps when they're they're dealing with cases like this rather than as flippant as he Well I I agree about that. I think that er Judge er 's remarks were a little unfortunate er but er he's now ret nearing retirement and occasionally all of us, I've done it myself Mm. in the past, make remarks which I regret. Er but the basis of what he had to say is presents a problem which do face judges in the class of case. Er unfortunately one has cases from time to time on girls of this age who set out to entice men. Er it's unfortunate that they should but when the men succumb to their er approaches then it's always a very difficult Mm. problem as to what to do about it. Well the men although they may not have realized they were thirteen must have been pretty stupid not to realize they were perhaps below consent age. Oh yes well I agree about that. But a great deal depends on the circumstances. I have experience of this class of case over a period of more than fifty years and it hasn't been uncommon in the past even in the days when judges took a more rigorous view than they cline er inclined to do nowadays not to punish er in any with a custodial Mm. sentence as men youngish men not older men youngish men who behave in this way. Now Judge as you you said you know er and erm Sir Frederick I know you're retired now, he's seventy one do you think there should be a mandatory retirement age for judges perhaps. That maybe they get to a certain time when they're going to be out of touch ? has it that it should be seventy from the future. Mm. It all depends on the judge. I mean I remember judges who were were er much younger than seventy who were beyond it. On the other hand I remember judges who were over seventy five. The most outstanding judge in my lifetime has been Lord Reed. Er he does he doesn't figure very much in the tabloids Yeah. because he he was so good that he never annoyed anybody by silly remarks. But he was well over eighty when he retired. Do you think we should have slightly younger judges. I mean there is the move to make people judges earlier than they have been recently? Well it depends upon what you mean by early. As Lord er the Lord Chief Justice said in a television programme Question Time er two nights ago it takes a good deal of experience before somebody's qualified to be a judge and when you do become a judge you have a great deal to learn. You know there was an old legal story er saying rather er that er in the first five years that a a j a man is appointed a judge he doesn't know the job. In the next five years he thinks he does but doesn't. And in the last five years he's too old to do it. That's worrying. I don't want to appear in front a judge in his first five years then . But that that's the problem that we all have This is one of the problems that the ju burdens that the judge has to bear. Did you in your time ever send a man to execution? No I I only tried three capital murder cases and all three they got acquitted. Were you were you glad about that? In two of them I was. Sir Frederick thank you for er speaking to me this afternoon. Thank you. Interesting talking to you bye bye Good bye. Okay er we move on over six seven minutes to go before the end of the programme. Let's talk to er Steve erm where are hang on just one moment whilst I find you. Hello Steve? Hello James Hi. Hello. Just er one final comment about this Halloween. Really with very few exceptions it's simply a bit of harmless fun. I mean let's face it That's always the worse thing isn't it whe the the most annoying this when it's harmless fun . Er yeah. Come into my parlour said the spider to the fly. Horror films. What's your comment about those? I mean Do you believe in devil? Television Do you believe in the devil? on children than any other media. I agree Steve I agree. Do you believe in the devil though? Do you believe that Halloween has any kind of place with the devil or not? No. You don't. I don't. Er then there is nothing I can say to change your mind. I mean you will you will go on merrily your own sweet way and erm I I hope nothing happens to sort of I mean we we we don't er we don't dance on sheep's hearts here in Gate Helmsley. Well I don't know because North Yorkshire's pretty sort of erm er pretty rife as far as black magic is concerned. Well you And d'ya know I I'm beginning to think you sort of protest so much that maybe you're a leader of a coven or something. Erm Put on the old sheep's head and dance naked round the bonfire. Is that right? Well no I'm not no I'm not. It's just that I mean this is the only thing about Halloween that I don't like is the import from America of this trick or treat nonsense. Yep. I don't like that one bit. But leave that to one side But that's only because it's an American idea that's the only reason you don't like it No no I I don't I don't like it er it er no I simply don't like it. I can't really tell you why it's just I don't like the don't like the idea of children going round er begging for treats, treats money whatever it might be. Yes I agree with you there. But I really to believe that Halloween does has no real influence. There are always exceptions you know to the rule. Okay Steve thank you for your call. You think it has no problem and er we'll squeeze in one more call before the end of the programme. And that's Christine from Harrogate hello Christine. Hello Christine speak to me . turn the radio off You what? You've got to turn the radio off. Have you turned the radio off? Come back to the phone Christine . Hello Christine. Hello. Hi. Hello. Hello. Erm I'm with you on this trick and er treat thing. Now I've heard people No you're not I'm not going trick or treating. say that they do this so they can get money for fireworks for Guy Fawkes night. Have you heard people say that? He's not answering. I am I don't know what there's a cut on this. What's where where's where's the where's the cut off come on this flipping phone? No it isn't It i hang on I can hear you. Hello can you hear? Yes. Is that better? Yeah. Okay right off you go. I well I agree with you on this er trick or treat. Erm people say they come round they come round with their children Mm. er mothers to g they say what they don't want treats as in sweets they want money to buy fireworks And he fixed it to buy fireworks for bonfire night. Yeah. And I disagree that they should. It's begging. You think it's begging. Yes. Yeah. Er I well I agree but I mean parents seem to be quite keen for their er their children to out and do it. Yes erm but it is begging and it is it is pagan. Yeah. So you won't be letting yours out? No. Okay. No. Okay Christine thank you for your call. Bye bye Bye. Erm I don't know whether we had gremlins in there or er or not in the end I really couldn't decide actually to be honest. Taking us to the news at two a little music for you and er hopefully I shall return next Saturday at twelve o'clock. Until then from all of us here on the Whales Show on B B C Radio York a very good afternoon to you. Bye bye. Oh did we play this we did didn't we. I didn't mean to play that at all. I think we played this one too. Did we play this one? No we didn't play this one did we? Cos the trouble with C Ds you see you can't see them going round you don't know which one you finished with. To be absolutely, strictly theological in fact, William Booth made a little mistake in the song because God will never ever send another pentecost. It was a once off thing. And, in our English language we actually make this mistake when we talk about birthdays French, in some ways are for more sensible with language, and you only ever have one birthday, the rest of them are anniversaries of your birthday. And God has only ever, and only ever will send one pentecost, and that took place on the day of pentecost, the birthday, the birth of the church. There are, as we've been reminded, we celebrate that again today, an anniversary. I've gotta confess, I don't like th the expression Whitsun so much, I prefer, er the expression, what it really is, it is pentecost. And literally it means just fifty. That what it means, and it was fifty days se se se seven weeks, after the death and resurrection of Jesus and the disciples had been told to wait in an upper room until the Holy Spirit would descend upon them, and you've had that record read to you from acts chapter two of just what took place on that day, that birth day of the church of Jesus Christ. Course, it didn't end there. Birthdays are beginnings not endings. And, the early church grew from there. And that experience that took place on that initial day that is the birthday of the church was not just a one off thing, but as others came into the church they experienced not another pentecost, but if you like, their own pentecost. And we're gonna look at a passage in just a few moments in, it's in the eighth chapter of acts where a group of people there, they were Samaritans how they came in to experience their pentecost. But you know, for every one of us as Christians, Jesus Christ lives in us by the Holy Spirit, by his spirit. Jesus Christ, when he er, went back to heaven he went back as a fe , as a glorified, but as a physical being. That is why, the physical resurrection of Jesus is so important. There is a man in the glory. There is a man seated on the right hand of God the Father, there interceding for you and for me. It's not his spirit that's doing it, it is the same person that the disciples spoke to when they walked the streets of Palestine, it is the same person that went around healing the sick, it is the same person that was born in the, in the manger at Bethlehem, he is now, after having died, been raised again by the power of the trying God had, he is now ascended back into heaven, in glorified form, and he is there interceding, representing you and me before his father there in heaven. He is there in that local situation. And just the same as when Jesus was here on earth he was in one place, he he confined himself to a body. And he is there now in the glory, but yet we say, we invite Jesus into our heart, and he walks, and we sing the song from the, he walks and he talks, how is it that this happens if Jesus is there in heaven? Well it happens, and it's made possible because he does it by his spirit. Now there aren't two spirits, there's not the spirit of Christ, and the Holy spirit. There's not a multitude of spirits. God is a spirit! And he is the mystery of the trinity. God the Father, who is also spirit. God the son, who is also spirit. And God the Holy Spirit. And so, Jesus Christ indwells your life as a Christian, and he indwells my life as a Christian by his spirit, by the Holy Spirit. We are born again by the spirit of God. We become Christians through the work of the Holy Spirit. But the New Testament teaches us, that apart from that new birth by the spirit, and that indwelling of Jesus Christ in our lives by the spirit, there is a subsequent experience that is called receiving or being baptized as a Holy Spirit. We're gonna look at this little passage in in acts eight, which shows to us that these Samaritan chri , they were saved! They had accepted Jesus Christ as their, as their saviour, they had been born again. They were Christians. They had been baptized. And yet, there was something missing in their experience. Let me read a few verses, reading first of all from verse twelve it says,that when they believed Philip preaching the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized men and women alike. And even Simon himself believed. And after being baptized he continued on with Philip, as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, and he was constantly amazed! This fellow Simon, you read about him in a few verses earlier, he was a, he was a magician, a so , er a sorcerer, he was the, the wi the witch doctor if you like, if he was in i i in an African situation, there he was, he was the medicine man of the town, of the area and he too believed and was converted, he was baptized, and he was amazed at the miracles that he'd seen being performed by Philip through the power of God. He was a man who was used to the supernatural but he was amazed at the things that he saw! And it says, now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem heard that Somaria had received the word of God they sent them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For he had not yet fallen on upon any of them. They had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. They they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw that the spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them much money, saying, give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to him, may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God without mo , with money! You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that if possible the intention of your heart may be forgiven you for I see that you are in the gaol of bitterness and in the bondage of inequity. Simon answered and said, pray to the Lord for me yourselves to that nothing of what you have said may come upon me. Philip, who was an evangelist, he had gone down to Somaria, in fact, the Holy Spirit had taken him there. If you read a few er, verses, a chapter or so earlier on, he had been speaking to one man to a er er a high official from Ethiopia, and he had been sharing with him from Isaiah chapter fifty three, the message of Jesus Christ. This Ethiopian, he had come to Jerusalem, he was a, he was a a,go , a Godly man, he was seeking after the things of God, and he had come to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage to worship God, and he was returning home, and he had got hold of the scroll that had Isaiah fifty three in it, and he was reading it, and Philip goes up to the man in the chariot, he said, do you understand what you're reading? The man says, how can I except somebody explain to me? And Philip, it says there, he says and er er,, he preached unto him Jesus showing him that Isaiah fifty three referred to Jesus Christ. And the man was er, accepted Christ as his saviour and they went down and Philip baptized in there, in in in the river. And, as they come out of the water the fa , the bible says the spirit takes Philip away and he goes down now to to so to Somaria and and he starts preaching there in Somaria a and there's this tremendous result! He sees miracles taking place! Many folk coming to know Jesus Christ the saviour. It says, there was great joy in all the city! And yet, there was still something missing. And word gets back to apostles in Jerusalem. They had heard about the blessing there, they had heard about the healing, the deliverance, the joy, yet nobody had received the Holy Spirit. They'd been baptized in water as we've already read, and yet nobody had received the Holy Spirit. Now, as we've said earlier on the Holy Spirit works in the new birth and it is through the work of the Holy Spirit that we come to know God. That we are born again. That we become Christians. Jesus, shortly before he left his disciples he tells them, it's in Mark chapter sixteen, er yes, Mark chapter sixteen, in verse seventeen, it says,these signs will accompany those who have believed in my name. They will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues. We are born again of God's Holy Spirit . This is something that God does in in the verses earlier, Jesus says go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation, he who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved! It's the work of God's spirit. The result of the preaching of the gospel, men and women respond and are born again. They become followers of Jesus. So the Holy Spirit works, in our lives to bring us to Christ, to bring us to new birth. To bring us to become Christians. Then there is this subsequent experience which follows receiving or being filled with the Holy Spirit. Peter tells in his first apistle in chapter one, in verse twenty three, for you have been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable, that is through the living and abiding word of God. So the Holy Spirit is at work. And God's word is used in bringing us to new birth, in bringing us, er to faith in Jesus Christ. And this is what happened here in Somaria. In verse fourteen it says,when the apostles in Jerusalem that Somaria had received the word of God and we cannot become Christians without God's word. It is his word that makes us aware of our condition. That we are sinners. It is his word that makes us aware that Jesus Christ came and died for us, that God loves us. How shall they hear, the bible says, without a preacher? How will they, how will folk hear? How will they come to faith without the word of God? Faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God. So when they hear this, the apostles back in Jerusalem, they send Peter and John down to Somaria for this special purpose that they might pray for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. Now why, why couldn't Philip have prayed for the people? He had brought them to faith in Jesus Christ. He had preached the gospel. God had, through him, performed miracles! Amazing miracles and signs and wonders! Why couldn't Philip pray for them? Well, of course, there's a sense in which he could easily have prayed for them, but at that moment, in that particular place, that was not God's purpose. And this is sometimes where we get a little bit, you know, hung up,a a and and when we tend to make a little bit, we make mistakes a lot. We have got to allow God to do his work in his way and in his time. And in God's plan at this particular moment i this was not Philip's function, it wasn't his job. He had fulfilled, he had discharged his mission, he had preached the gospel he had seen men and women coming to Jesus Christ, he had seen the mi mi miracles happening he had baptized those who have put faith in Jesus, and now, you see, it's not a one man show, there was, there was a leadersh , there was a team involved here. The apostles come down. Not because Philip was unable to do it, not because he was incapable of doing it, but here is God's purpose, of ma , of people working together in bringing about his will and his purposes. We've all, we've gotta remember this, that every one of us, we have a place in God's will and plan and whilst we are in that place everything is good well there's, there's still problems of course, there are still difficulties, there are still heartaches, but things are working right. The machinery is working correctly. But once we try to operate outside of that place, and we try to do somebody else's job, we try to fulfil somebody else's function, then we are in trouble! Then the thing is out of gear. Then the gears start crashing. There's not that smooth synchronized er way of going on which God purposes, and in , and intends. You see God is th ,i i is a God of order he's not a God of disorder, it's not a case of anybody doing what they like, he works according to his pattern. And who are you and I to tell God what his purpose is, and his pattern's gonna be? He is sovereign and he will work according to his will. And he's used Philip and now he i ,i i in his purpose he brings down Peter a a and John to to, to have their part i in his will and his purpose at this time. We do not all have the same ministries. We do not all have the same function within the body of Christ. And later on the apostle Paul, he elaborates on this, and he uses the picture of an ordinary body, and he says every member's not the same. We're not a, our our physical body's not made up of a multitude of hands or a multitude of feet there are feet, and the feet has one function, the hand has another. We don't hear with our hands! We hear with our ears! And every part of that body has a function. And the body is working well and fine when every part is doing their function. Now, at a pinch, I might be able to walk a step or two on my hands with my feet in the air, believe me, it's not a pretty sight! And I won't get very far. And even if I, how far I get it won't be quick because, God didn't give me hands to walk on, he gave me feet to walk on. And so, the body works better when each part is doing it's particular function. And this isn't just true of course, of our physical body, it's true of his body, the church. And oh, when we do something else, and my hands say to my feet,ha hang on, you can walk as well as they can, let's try it. They can't! And there's cra , there's chaos! There's trouble! And so it is within the body. When I say, I can do it as well as he can do it, I can do that! God says no, hang on, you're supposed to be doing this. And it's only as we fulfil our function with the body. That's why it's so important to kno , for everyone of us, to know what our ministries are. That we might be, not frustrated, you know, frustration is because, I'm not able to do what I should be doing. And oh, the frustration that can build up in our lives as Christians because we are not where we should be or doing what God purposes for us! We do not then all have the same ministries. And so, Peter, and John, they come down to Somaria. And when Simon, they they laid their hands on the folk and God in his graciousness pours out his spirit and they receive the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them money saying, give this authority to me as well so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. Simon was not trying to buy the Holy Spirit but rather the ability to impart the Holy Spirit. There's a sense in which it might sound rather strange, I think Simon was there was something in this guy that is attractive I think. He he's already opened hi up his heart to the Lord, there's a lot that he's gotta learn, there's a lot he's gotta let go of, there's a lot of his old life still there, but isn't that true of every one us? It doesn't all disappear over night. We grow in grace, we grow as we learn what God teaches us. And we're all at different stages in our pilgrimage. And so, Simon he he wants what the apostles have got. If only I could he he looks back on his life and he knows the power that he has experienced. He knows the authority that he's had in that community, he has seen supernatural things happening in his life and through him, albeit, they were not of God, but has been involved in supernatural things. And he sees something now that to him is mind blowing! He's never seen anything like this before! He has already been constantly amazed at what has taken place through Philip! And now, with Peter and John, this is just the end as far as he's concerned. He said, oh if only I had that power! If only if I had that ability! Can I acquire it? Can I have it? And he offers them money. He doesn't realize that you can't buy it. He doesn't realize that it's not up for sale. But oh, if I might have this ability to impart the Holy Spirit! But he's made this carbon thing you see, it wasn't for the the apostles couldn't it! Peter and John couldn't do it! In the New Testament there are four different words that are used to refer to a gift and the one used here means an endowment, and an endowment comes, not because of me, but it becomes because of the grace of the giver. I don't merit it. I don't, I haven't worked for it. I've done nothing worthy of receiving it. It is the grace of the giver! And the Holy Spirit, God's gracious gift to us. Just like salvation, is not because we merit it. We don't merit it! We haven't worked for it! We can't acquire it by any other means other than receiving the gift as God the gracious giver makes it available. Wanna say a bit more about that a little later on. Now, these er, Samaritans, they received the Holy Spirit, now how do we know that the Samaritans actually spoke in tongues? Because it doesn't tell you that here. It doesn't say so. But it, certainly as you read through the New Testament, the acts of the apostles, it certainly is the norm for those who received the Holy Spirit, that they spoke in other tongues. And we've already read that verse from Mark's gospel, where it says quite, Jesus himself says quite clearly that those, these signs will accompany those who believe in my , they will speak with new, with new tongues. And wherever you read of this experience happening, again, and again, you read of the folk there receiving the Holy Spirit, and speaking in in other tongues. In speaking a language they have not learned. It wasn't just on the day of pentecost. And it seems that this is the norm and there comes a time when you don't always mention the norm, you don't underline it every time, you don't refer to it every time because it is the excepted thing. It is the normal practice. And everybody was aware that this was the norm, and so you accept it and take it for granted. It is however, mentioned in most incidences, in the New Testament. But if they didn't speak with tongues how did Simon know that they had received the Holy Spirit? It wasn't because their faces suddenly lit up. It wasn't because there was some weird expression that had come over them. How on earth did he know? And the only record that we have in scripture of any evidence of folk having received the Holy Spirit was that they spoke with other tongues. There certainly was some evidence. When Simon saw that the spirit was bestowed to the laying on of the apostles hands it wasn't just something he conjured up in his imagination. There was some evidence for it. There was something that with one of his sense that he could recognize. There was a physical sign. And yet, in the New Testament there is no other sign given. There is no other physical manifestation given of the Holy, of the o , baptism of the Holy Spirit, other than that of speaking in other tongues. You see, it wasn't their joy, it wasn't just because they were exuberant, they had already i di , expressed this joy back in verse eight, at the preaching of the gospel, there was much rejoicing in the city! There was great joy in the city! So it wasn't just the joy, he was used to that, this was something over and above that. And certainly, as you read through the New Testament and the in both the acts of the apostles and the apistles, the apistles of Paul in particular, speaking in tongues goes hand in hand with receiving the Holy Spirit. Now, speaking in tongues is not the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is not speaking with other tongues, but they go together. It's an evidence. You know, it's a little bit like a a car log book, or a registration doc document as they're called now. The log book, the registration document is not the car, but it is evidence of the ownership of the car. I've got the registration document because the car belongs to me. I can't drive the document around. And sometimes we make that mistake as though speaking in tongues was the Holy Spirit. It is but an evidence of the Holy Spirit. It is one of his gifts. One of his ministries, one of his many, many ministries, but it is one of his ministries. And if we've been filled with the Holy Spirit, then we should have the evidence to go with it. There should be the the aca station if you like, there should be the documentation, and it certainly seems in the New Testament that that is speaking with other tongues, it's not the only thing of course. You see, it's not just speaking in other tongues, there is gonna become the evidence of it as well as we grow in him. Notice also, that there is no evidence or suggestion that they had to wait for th for this baptism, for this infilling of the Holy Spirit. It is God's free gift to all. That is why I I I mentioned those mar , those remarks right at the beginning, God will never ever send another pentecost, the only people that God told to wait were those early disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit came and they had to wait for ten days from the ascension of Jesus until the Holy Spirit came. There is no suggestion anywhere else in the New Testament of waiting for the Holy Spirit. He has already been given! God is not gonna give the Holy Spirit again. He has given him, and he has never withdrawn him! And so it's not a case of our waiting it's rather a case of our receiving. You see if I was to say to you, right well I am gonna go out and purchase something, I'm gonna get something and give it to you as a gift then you have got to wait until I do that. I might go out and buy it straight away, I might wait weeks, months before I acquire the particular thing to give to you as a gift, you've gotta wait on on me giving it to you. But once I have the thing and make it available, and say here is the gift that I promised it's yours, it's available, then, all you have to do is come and take it. And any waiting, any time lag is not my fault, it's not cos I've been slow in getting it, I've already got it there, it's all wrapped up it's gift wrapped with your name on it! Any time lag, any any period of waiting is because you haven't come and received it. And so it is with God's gift of the Holy Spirit. He does not suggest, there is no suggestion in the New Testament that we have got to tarry, and wait, and long and, and so on for it, it's there available to receive. The apostles came down to Somaria, they laid hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. And this is God's purpose, he is given the Holy Spirit and he has not withdrawn him. It is God's free gift to his people. Harold Carter, some of you will know of him and have heard of him who was er, a preacher within one of the early preachers within the pentecostal movement in this country, and one of their teachers, said that to teach people to wait for the Holy Spirit is nothing in the world but a combination of works, and unbelief. You see, if I were to start waiting, it means I've gotta start doing something. What am I waiting for? Am I waiting on God who is reluctant to give? God is the most generous giver in the universe! He's not reluctant to give, he's not slow in giving. Jesus used the illustration, he says, you parents, you fathers, if your children are hungry you don't mock them by giving them a stone you give them egg, you give them bread, you give them meat, you don't give them a scorpion, something to harm them, you don't mock them by giving them some, something they can't eat! How much more your Heavenly Father will he give the Holy Spirit to those who ask of him? To those who come and receive it. Notice also that Peter and John did not pray that God would give them the Holy Spirit they prayed that they might receive the Holy Spirit. You haven't gotta twist God's arm to receive his gifts. He is a generous giver! When sa , they began laying hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. In verse fifteen, when they came down they prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. Sometimes in our praying re , concerning the Holy Spirit, we say, we ask God to give, but God says hang on I've already given! You're asking me to do what I've done! Pray rather, that they might receive. And perhaps we should exercise this idea, this thought when we pray for the salvation of people. Not to pray that God will save, but rather that people will receive the gift of eternal life, because God's made it available! He's made his forgiveness freely available, the gift is there! God's gift of eternal life! And the praying is not that God will save people he's er, done all that he can to save, but rather that people will respond to his generosity and receive his gift. And so we see there in verse seventeen, that they began laying their hands on them and they were receiving the Holy Spirit. The onus was not on God doing something, but on them receiving. And you know, if we wait for God to baptize us in the Holy Spirit, can I suggest you'll wait until you die and still not know that experience. Because God has done this, he's he's made him available. The thing is for us to receive. To seek and receive that gift. The promise and the fulfilment, let me just give you a couple of verses there in John fourteen, John make er, Jesus he makes this statement to his disciples, in John fourteen, in verses sixteen and seventeen,and I will ask the Father and he will give you another helper , another word for the Holy Spirit,that he may be with you forever. This is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it does not know him, does not behold him or know him, but you know him because he abides with you and will be in you . And there,i Peter when he's preaching on the day pentecost, he says this is was has happened, God has done just that, just as is there I don't know what she's on about, you tell me Kim Oh I haven't even gone yet I'm jumping like a jelly baby Yeah you jump right I'll give him a kiss and you I might get a smile out of him Listen you told me you ain't gonna cry this morning, put it this way you won't be going to the sweet shop will we?

Yeah What's that to do? comparing it , comparing it with erm one thousand, two hundred, he's, he says it's rather suspicious What is that for the actual three hund Just, just the actual erm sliding mirror wardrobes Just the doors no fitting or anything? Yeah it's for the fittings and everything, erm and I've had prices like one thousand two hundred, eighteen hundred, and this bloke you know, says three hundred and eighty eight Oh and Gary's rather suspicious at that price, we, we had a builder that came round he, he wanted four hundred and twenty Yes and that was with the doors from Texas and he thought oh no you know Yeah we'd rather get it done properly, erm, but erm, this that came yesterday morning, he reckons it, that he can do the whole of the bedroom, look there's been an accident, I've got to tell you Oh good they've gone right over that bank, right over that bank, right over there, it's bounced over It's speeding I expect Yeah to get that far erm and they can do the wardrobes and the fitment erm and wardrobes either side erm for eighteen hundred Oh which is the price we were looking at, it's not too cheap and it's not too expensive Yeah cos Gary sort of said we should set prices that are too low Maybe they just, he just done it so cheap because of the recession I mean Yeah you can get almost anything done at the moment Yeah can't you? so we'll wait and see Well was it all private people then we'll see what price they give or companies? No it's all companies What even this three hundred and eighty eight? Yeah, that's Well you can always check it out Yeah make sure it is a genuine it, the, the, he's come from the company and he's not doing it privately or something You see the thing is, I said, Gary said to me he said did you ask them about the over bed erm units and that and I said yeah, I said he wanted to, he, he said he could do the over bed unit for eighteen hundred plus the wardrobes for three eighty eight Yeah well this people I mean with, with, that I mean that really is more or less the same amount as the other companies have said for er more or less the whole lot, so why the wardrobes are so cheap and yet the, the bed surrounding is so expensive, we don't know Mm whereas people they reckon that they can do it, they can do the whole lot for eighteen hundred Yeah , oh strange isn't it? Yeah , it's er, it's er cheap for the wardrobes, but expensive for the over bed unit, I mean Gary said well at that price he said the over bed unit we might as well get out of a catalogue. Well, yeah, talking of catalogues actually you might know, my two want a beanbag right? Yeah They've got one in Argos but the colours are disgusting and it's twenty pound, you see I went and brought one for Boo Boo, that one from Argos Yeah , yeah and they absconded it, and the dog hasn't a hope in hell and also the ones you get for the kids, when you sit in them they sit up like little chairs don't they?

Yes that I did I bought a mix Yeah, yeah but for us lot it made four nice medium size ones yeah that's right and then I never ate all mine, and the kids never ate all theirs, so I thought well I get the frozen ones and just get one out each time for Tony stick it in the oven half hour before. Oh that's what I was going to look at the brushes What? Hair brushes, I want, I want one of these something that's not too hard I've got a, er comb, I've got one of those that I use for Anthony at the moment and why brush? Why not a comb? Cos his hair's not thick enough for a comb Yeah true See what I want Anthony's hair is quite thick cos really, something like that, but only a half one You want a small one don't you? Yeah that's one thing I've got, I've got my denman I've got that one What about that grey one up the end there or is that too big? Yeah, you see I've got, again it's erm, complete handle on that one one of them one's, I want a half one like this with just this With soft bristles on Yeah yeah too big ain't they? Yeah Or they're the right size but they've got the hard bristles Yes that's right but I like, I ask the brushes I tell you what have you where was it I saw it now? Woolworth's they've got some fantastic Easter eggs, no not Woolworth's Robert Cray, they've got a massive great big Kinder egg Easter egg in there Yeah really pretty it is, I mean it's four ninety five Yeah my two both dart for them when we went in there Yeah I thought oh, see I was gonna get a present for Easter, but they've got so much there's Yeah nothing they really need that's right They've probably got a few over here Erm I'll probably get erm another video Thanks lovely thank you me hands are alright now, they've warmed up Yeah I'll go over this way, let's have a look in chemist for that comb Yeah they have a lot more choice don't they? Yeah , brush I should say, can pop up, oh Midland we can do on the way back, we can go first though Yeah okey dokey, I keep looking at that clock there but it's wrong innit? I know ha oh Dixon's I've got to pop into Dixon's, they've got a P C advertised Yeah in the computers, on the erm telly Mm Gary wants me to find out a bit more about it cos he wants a new one, another, well he wants a new one, cos we done a deal, get my bed, if we get the bedroom done Mm he'll buy a P C, I said okay fair enough I don't care, I'll get my bedroom done What computer he's got? He's got an Amstrad, but it's not a coloured one Oh right Why, is Tony after one? Well no, we wanted to get one for Charlotte, but erm, I don't think they'll use them Oh no this one's, you know it's a proper, proper video Oh yeah yeah that's yeah what they use up the school a proper computers, the screens and printouts and mouses and Yeah I went up the school and had a look at them Yeah I was talking to a lady about them Yeah but I've got to discuss it with Tony first erm you see that's what you want, but they're too hard mm, even they're quite prickly Yeah They're not too bad Yeah Trouble is though as you say he's not got a lot of hair really has he? No It's straight forward onto his scalp I know what you look, I know what sort you're looking for though Yeah and it's what I'm looking for Let's have a look and it's three ninety nine Bloody hell and it's likely to last Is it as soft as what you think though for him? Yeah, erm how do you work it? That's pretty It is isn't it? Mind you it might be a bit uncomfortable on the head Yeah or you can use it as a tie round mhm, what about having, that's a bit harder Yes, same as the denman Oh, get it out It's not too bad is it? No probably about the softest Mm no I think that's harder than that Yes no that's there you are, now you can't get softer than that it's nifty innit? Look at this it might be three ninety nine, but I'll get it Oh we, cos me and Gary we've got a brush each and he wants one, see I like that, but I think that, that is a bit big And it's dearer Yeah No Kieran, don't pull any of them off you'd think it'd be cheaper if it was smaller wouldn't you? Yeah Yeah hold on just looking at something right, three little ducks A load of different hair things in here ain't there? Mm Very expensive in there though isn't it? Yeah A lot of things I'll go into Boots and find something cheap Well now cos places like Superdrug and, and Boots and that aren't er, I mean that's just basically a chemist that innit? That's right yeah So it should have everything, I still think that it's a bit expensive though Yeah What about that Ferguson factory closing down then? Yeah when they gave out I thought that was really sad with all those redundancies a couple of months ago, I thought that'll be it, I mean I've been there Fifty percent off marked red tickets That's right I'm reading all these money things off Yeah Well I know, but it was sad because in Gosport that was what keep most of them going, I mean like they said none of them have never been on the dole before, they've all been there since they've left school, there was a couple there Yeah and they'd both been there thirty years since they've left school Yeah and now they just don't know what to do, there's no jobs, there's no nothing No and they said that some of them were thinking of moving, but and they also reckon that the Gosport and Portsmouth are the worst off than anywhere else in this country Yeah it's very sad, but, what can you do? That's why Alex has had to go back to London Yeah, I know she was telling me, there she is a highly qualified Secretary and she's, and she's and used to bloody did you know she's a qualified magician as well? No No, she only told me that the other day yeah she is Yeah so that's two jobs she's qualified for and she can't get jobs in either Ridiculous, erm twenty Bensons please One ninety four then please I think I'm gonna get a Cadbury's Twirl while I'm here I will, I'll get all this change out of my pocket let's get rid of this two, four, five, right, there's twenty five there for one of those, thanks Yeah she's a qualified magician as well Yeah you know, she was saying there's a girl at work and she's a top qualified chef Mm and she's, all she can do is what Alex's doing Yeah just general cooking and cleaning Maybe she'll apply at the hospital then if she's a qualified cook, they're in and out of there like, like nobody's business the cooks, they can't, well they don't stay long Why's that? They don't get paid that much Ah, that's it innit? Yeah The trouble on, the trouble is with a recession on it's an advantage of, oh they've closed down Yeah that didn't last long did it? they couldn't afford the mortgage, erm the erm the lease The lease Yeah, erm you know my mate Lorraine, her sister used to work in there part time and it was on a Friday You got your book, I've got mine it was on a Friday, it was her day off, she got called in at about three o'clock and they told her then, it was two weeks ago now I didn't notice yesterday, mind you I didn't walk past, yes I did, I must of walked past it Yeah, cos er Lorraine told me last, what Lorraine works every two weeks, what she's on this weekend, so erm, so it's two weeks ago she told Bloody hell I tell you as I walked past there on Friday, she said yeah she said we were still open then, they closed it that night, ridiculous It's terrible innit? Yeah I mean years ago I can remember coming into town and seeing that furniture shop filled with people walking around, every time I go past it now it is empty Yeah which is why I think a lot of things, places should be able to accommodate for shop owners and reduce their leases while this recession's on Yeah It's so unfair I won't half be surprised if they get in this time, I really will The trouble is, us council owners will be worse off under the Labour council Well I so you can't win That's right I know, but what can you do? I mean the way, it, it's happened, I don't think John Major stands much hope basically Yeah I hate all this politic business any road, but I know let's face it, whoever gets in, someone's gonna lose out Yeah I was quite shocked at that er thing about the fox hunting I was pleased What about it? for my sister's sake Oh what they didn't ban it? Mm, yeah I'll go in these doors, I wasn't surprised, I didn't think they would, but as this guy said afterwards he said whether you do it now or later he said, within the next five years it's gonna be banned so I think it still will be banned in the end Yeah I do at the moment, sympathize, that's a nice colour It is, innit? I didn't but now I sympathize It's not bad material either No , that's nice innit? That's good Just right for around indoors, yes that one's nice to Mm I mean if they'd of banned it, there'd of been a lot more people out of work, which is Yeah probably part of the reason why they didn't for the time being That's right I like those jumpers too Yeah Oh they've got rid of those white ones Sweat shirt Oh no they're not they've shoved them down there are they? Yeah Nine to ten years, oh a bit big for Charlotte oh there Paul, they've got some white ones Oh yeah, oh I don't like that material, I'd rather get them them, this material Oh you're a fussy faggot I know what do you expect for two ninety nine but they , they sort of itch, whereas this stuff doesn't Oh See it's really soft feel that er actually I quite like the lace up ones anyway Yeah they're three ninety nine though aren't they? Yeah Yeah well nothing's much changed really Mm oh have you seen those knickerbockers over there? Eh? Knickerbockers, for babies Oh yeah They're sweet aren't they? Mhm Oh they, they, oh yeah so they are Look at these ones? There's a, as I'm speeding them round here, oh one nine, nine, seven, that's Charlie's size as well Yeah Aaron's a seven Are they supposed to be like that then, different at the front? It's just the way the pattern is Yeah, ah, I like the new pink ones, and that's for boys Yeah That'll be just right for on holiday won't they? Yeah, get two different colours Yeah, but the thing is right they're sevens and they're gonna be too small for them by the time holiday gets round say September Mm that's the trouble well Aaron's a six and they're seven so I'm safe to getting Aaron a seven I'm safe to getting mine sevens yeah Yeah there's erm I think that's seven is it? No it's an eight Mind you when the warmer weather gets here they can wear them anyway Oh yeah I don't know which ones I prefer the purple or the pink One of each, then she's always got another pair, cos I don't, is that blue? Mm Yeah I'm not keen on the blue No have one of each Yeah, they've got these No I don't like that Yeah, it clashes Yeah Oh I like those ones Mm thirty seven, ha, don't get red No I don't like red, I'd get him black Black and blue? Yeah, yeah so they won't, not, well they won't get so dirty, again with these you can just stick them in the wash What, if they ain't got the size you can't Seven I think we've gone through all the sevens in the blacks ain't you? It's only a five nine, they're nines there, have you got a watch on? Yeah Oh good ah hang on er, three pairs there, seven, six and an eight, right there's two blacks in sevens here, well I'll just have a pair of each, I've only got a fiver in me purse just wondering whether to get black or blue though? Mm The mauve's quite nice aren't they? What do you reckon? I don't know, they look a bit rough on the front to me they do Mm don't they? I'll just find a seven in the blue print Haven't we got any then? Hang on they're alright on the front, want another seven don't you for Aaron? Yeah cos the black's likely to go grey, whereas the blues don't look so bad No when they go oh they've got socks there to go with them Mm, yeah I'm not too worried about her socks though but I say I'm gonna have plenty of Marks and Sparks' vouchers Yeah Seven? I've got a seven here Oh and the white are nice, but they just get dirty too quick Yeah I don't know whether to get Aaron one or not, he's got enough at home, he's got enough from last year What have my two got? I believe I can always pop in town tomorrow I was wondering actually I think I might wait until that dress comes through, I'll try we can always ask to put them away for a week yeah that's what I might do Why? Well then, if, we can put them away for a week Actually, actually wanted new trainers and they've got them there Yeah they have ain't they? He has been nagging me actually since I threw his others, he threw his others away that when some more came in, but these are alright for girls ain't they? Six, they're nice, boy's nine Yeah No I'm gonna leave it cos I can't make me mind up I think I'll just walk away and leave it Where else did you wanna go? Erm I've got to go into erm What's the time then? Ten Right, we'll scan there and I want to have a look at the computers in there as well Yeah Okay, is there, I don't mind getting them shoes, but the thing is with, not knowing what the weather's doing Yeah you know and it, they don't need them, say they're both in their ordinary shoes at the moment Yeah I've also got to be careful because they've got size eights upstairs as well that Robert got them Yeah and it, oh Dixon's Yeah Dixon's it's over there innit? Going that way and er so you've already booked your holiday time up the hospital then or not? Not done it yet Not done it yet No I'm not bothered about going on holiday, I suppose I'm all worked up about getting bedroom sorted, ha Mm, I said to Tony if we can't afford to go I said don't worry about it, we might just go back down to where we went last year for a week because, it's like I was saying to Joanne this morning, that this year they won't, they're not gonna worry whether they don't go on holiday but next year when Charlotte's at school and got all her school mates saying oh where did you go and Yeah you know what it's like. That's right Ah, now that's the sort, they use the old B B C ones up the school and one's manufactured by Acorn Do you need any help there at all? Erm yeah you got on, on the advert on the television you've got a P C, which one is it? You haven't seen it obviously I've seen the advert it's embarrassing it's probably either the five, oh dear, I don't know actually, we actually do several P Cs in the Yes I know because we're only a small branch, we only carry like one or two maybe Mm at the most, erm is it I B M or No it's an Amstrad An Amstrad, is it five O or five two eight six? I can't remember, that's what I've come in to find out It could be the five two eight there's a five two eighty sixty two which is, about two hundred pounds, which is like a better machine Yeah erm which we do, which we haven't got in stock at the moment, but we can always get hold of Right, well I think the best thing to do is to leave it until I see the advert again It's so just enquiring on the catalogue interest, we've only got that one Leaflets, brochure? Yeah, yeah, is it the games pack one? No it wouldn't be the games pack, it'd be after that one Yeah, so erm Microsoft Works game pack erm see do that, so many in the range now these are like our, our highlighted deal ones you see Mm I think I'm better off leaving it I think erm see there's five five eight six which is this one, it's forty hard drive the Basingstoke's a larger branch aren't they? Yeah they, they, they have a business centre as well you see, erm Right we can always get hold of the stuff here, save you lugging it around because they come in big boxes and that Yeah, yeah it's not a problem so if you just want to have a look round up there and sort of come here Yeah we've got relations in Basingstoke, so Yeah we can have a look down there tomorrow Yeah, we can always get hold of them it's just that we don't carry them, we're a small branch you see Right we've not got a big room No so okay then unfortunately, but, I, I would give you one of these, but I can't even give you one of these But you haven't got one No, they only send us about three from the I believe they should be out in the like the National Press and things like that Yeah I'd imagine because they usually put it in Yeah things like the magazines the colour supplements and things like that Right but yeah the Basingstoke branch is the business centre and their business centre is like the size of this shop so it's Right And they've got a lot more and they would have them up and running as well Yeah so you could compare different ones and things like that Right I shall have to leave Gary in there for half an hour then Just drop him off and go to a canteen Yeah but Yeah sorry, we can always get hold of it, it's just we don't carry them here Right but as far as the search thing and stuff like that it's the same engineers we buy it from Bensons Yeah they can buy it from they just ring a telephone number okay then alright Alright? Thanks Thanks a lot, sorry about that That's okay never mind, I knew it was gonna be a waste of time You just thought you'd ask still perhaps we will get to Basingstoke this week didn't last Didn't you go last week? No why? Well I got home, I got everything all sorted out, Gary even left a message on the answerphone saying that he'd be home round about half past two and that Mm and erm, ha, got home, didn't wanna go out, there was me I got changed, I put on those new leggings I was all in black I thought I looked rather nice, you know, and Gary said what you all dressed up for? I said oh we're going out aren't we? Oh I don't wanna go now So you had a row No we didn't have a row he just went a sleep me Aar , me and Aaron had enough, we went for a walk down the lake we only went out for forty minutes, we were surprised how long we'd been gone Ha erm, I had, he only had his wellies on and his leggings puddles were that deep, you know, puddles were that deep I said to him you're not going in the puddle, he said yeah I am, no you're not, yeah I am, he did He did so oh well once he'd gone in there I, I let him get on with it Yeah and erm I just stuck him in the bath when we got home It's annoying that though innit? Especially if you got ready to go out Yeah you see, like, I mean I started staying at home on Saturdays and, I don't do nothing, if Tony comes home and says he wants to go out I get it ready then otherwise I just plan on staying home Yeah oh I'm not gonna go all to hassle getting organized and he comes home and says he don't want to go out That's right so I don't do it now till yeah he comes home, then it's up to him. Yeah Children's coming about eleven again Yeah, well she comes down about twenty to now and has a natter Yeah erm, have a talk and a laugh and she just stops for a coffee after Yeah or a talk, well she doesn't have to rush home cos there's no one there like Yes, that's right you know I'm gonna take the kids to see Snow White at the weekend Yeah up Basingstoke cinema with me mum What tomorrow? No probably Sunday Yeah could erm I might give you a ring later and say can you have Aaron Mm Gary's gonna find out, he's got yeah chance of overtime so I said well if you can get it, get it and I'll Yeah drop Aaron off in the morning Yeah, no it wouldn't be tomorrow because I think my mum's working so Yeah It doesn't say open that, and I pull the others No I know anything else you need to do? What's the time? Ten, ten past time You wanna browse round Peacock's Yeah or anywhere else while were here? erm Woolworth's, let's go and have a look in Woolworth's Yeah let's have a look in Woolworth's, I haven't been in there for ages, see what Easter eggs they've got Yeah erm, oh cut through over there I suppose I was thinking the other day when I worked out that money for Saturday is it, it came to something like two pound eighty when you had Jordan Yeah and like six pound something when I, and six pound forty when I had Eran, so I thought if we call it six pounds for a Saturday, when you have Jordan I'll give you three pound Right is that alright? Yep Cos I thought if we round it off both ways Yeah you know that, a little bit cheaper on your end and a bit more I give you oh what's this stand outside the shop and talk day, carry on over there, so are you happy with that? Yeah I don't want you not to be happy with it Yeah you know, say Well it's all money innit? Well, yeah, but I don't want you to sort of like As long as you get paid in the end Oh yeah, I just didn't want you sort of be short Yeah at the weekend or something No you know, erm er no cos I pay my cheque in yeah, alright then cos it's just three pound for last week then Yeah and six pound fifty then week cos I won't, you won't have them on Monday but if she keeps working it'll be most Mondays anyway Yeah so all the time I've got him Yeah now, I don't know if they've got them ones in here, what they got in here I wonder if my husband will remember to get me one this year? That'd be a first I can tell you, oh that's a good one innit? Mm, paying for the wrapping though Oh it's only ninety nine P that one though innit? Oh is it?

Well cos some, everybody has to go home, it's too late for you to be going out now anyway to pictures What you doing? Taking the fatty bits off darling, mummy don't like the fatty bits either stay at granddad's for a little while, while daddy watches that film and then go and see other nanny for a little while, cos you've got no playschool tomorrow so you haven't got to get up early have you? Mum could you teach me how to play that? Not now, no, we're having dinner and I'm doing this bingo for a minute look bring your Where is it? get your pencil I don't know where they are, they maybe in the front room Run in and ask granddad where they are, but don't look at the telly, then come out and I'll show you how to do it I am Yeah, it's quite easy mum ma Mm daddy wants a bit of Coke Well come out and get it then, got the pencils haven't you? Yeah Mm Mum ma, I want a bit of that one there Take that then don't spill it Don't you want to drink it? Me undone my, get, get my beat in, meat in Ah Vinegar Me like vinegar Mm mm Right push the door up, push the door up if you've got pencils, good girl I er, I bring Right bring the tin round here and I'll find you a pencil right, now bring your Snow White thing round, that's the best one to use, right What about Anthony? No Anthony's still eating darling, right, now that word there says Doc, D O C which is the name of one of the dwarfs, okay, so in all them letters there is the name Doc, so you've got to look for those three letters D O C alright, so you go along, no let me show you how to do it then. You go along each line and you find a D there but there's no Os next to it is there? So you go along to the next D and there's no Os there, so you come down, D, no Os, so you keep going along the lines and every time you get to a D you stop D O C That's it, D O C and then all you do is you draw a line around it oh dear, no we want another pencil, this one ain't gonna work on here is it? My, see if we can find a pen or something, that one might work, lean on the table cos it'll be easier Not too bad Yeah, right, then you'll scrub that one out like that, cos you've done that one, alright, then you pick another word and you look for it, right look for Grumpy G R U M P Y and you start by going across the top, alright? You get a nice space to sit down at the table move my plate and I'll sit here Yeah, well what about saying please Please what did you say? Now do it quietly That big red one? Well, no, er Grumpy Where's Grumpy? I don't know what's in it That one G R U M P Y, right? Grumpy Right, you do that and I'll do this That one down the bottom Mummy I do, I do done me Hang on, let me just do this game on card No let me just finish this game No You haven't finished eating yet No, me didn't eating now What about your cheese? Eaten it Yeah finish your cheese while mummy's finishing this card and then erm Is that, does that a C, a proper C Ah well you do it Charlotte you've got to match the letters up, not much good if I've got to stop to keep helping you is it? The idea is so you can do that while mummy does this No, no, hungry Thirty five , twenty one, fifty four, sixty nine, twenty, oh, there, five is not there Ah, look I've got it I saw this, one of those right, mum I finded erm one of those, but I just can't see any Cs or that number Well Charlotte it's not easy, it's gonna take you a long time, but then so Mum, mummy I can find C mm, mm that number with the and so that number We're running out of room on this table that number, that number Mummy move back Where am I gonna move it to? Push, push it back there, then you can carry on eating if you want to, then you can sit there that number I'm only showing you once darling and then you'll have to do it or else I'll never get me bingo done, alright, you choose a word to look for like Doc Mm Right that's D O C and then you look on here and you look for a D O C, when you found it you put a ring around it alright? Like that Mum I find it, C, that number, that number, that number Yeah, but they don't join up Charlotte and then you cross and then you cross it out Yeah but this can't find them Right, so you cross this out and now you've got to look for another word Erm it's very hard, if you can't do it go to the Snow White picture and colour the picture and me gonna do it What? No, we'll, we'll do it together later when mummy's got time to sit and help you alright? Yeah When I've done me bingo Yeah me gonna colour in on There you go if I put the pencil there, don't knock it off though Why? Cos you'll drop all your pencils that's why They're not there No Number one I think, no Mummy not it on there No, no Well get another one then No Me got another one er one me doing, I find a two that match up together mum, look Yeah, but you've got to have a complete word that matches Charlotte Look it matches Look why don't you do the colouring for now and then I'll help you do that in a little while when I've done this bingo? Alright Alright, good girl Where is this picture then? Here it is Snow White and the Seven Woofs Dwarfs, not Woofs No ah it's going in the butter No it's not Ah not if you don't move it, it won't go in the butter Just leave it down I don't recognizes that there is a problem of affordable housing as evidenced by minister's statements but the view of my policy colleagues in headquarters is that this is most appropriately addresses in district wide plans and not necessarily at structure plan level. Sorry. Can I go back to what Miss has just said? Surely that's in terms of where and how it is provided. Whereas what we're talking about in the structure plan is how much housing in total, of which affordable housing will form a greater or lesser part. That's right, but we would expect it to be subsumed in the numbers of overall requirements for housing. Yeah. Do you want to comment on what five thousand less than your figure would do for affordable housing ? I think as I said before, it would lessen the erm the measure of flexibility. Exactly which way it would affect it, whether it would be affordable housing or any other sort of housing is a matter for debate. Mr , sorry I you may want to comment in fact about the relationship of these figures and the emerging policy in Cleveland. Mr Chairman I feel a bit like an aircraft that's to come down to Leeds er er Bradford Airport rather than Teeside at the present moment. Er I think most of the problem is probably in the Leeds, Bradford er Harrogate area rather than our own area of Cleveland. Erm we have er approved regional planning guidance published September nineteen ninety three, which takes the allocations for Cleveland area through till two thousand and six at er fourteen thousand. We have er sufficient land available for development in Cleveland, er for eighteen thousand, two hundred and thirteen dwellings. Er we have er inherited a problem of over-forecasting perhaps in the seventies, with our first structure plans in the sense that the er employment was forecast to be much higher at that time. We have experienced quite considerable out migration er in the period since, and we do build in perhaps slightly optimistic erm migration net migration figures compared to the er O P C S er and and D O E figures but they are nevertheless accepted as part of this forecast the regional guidance, on the basis that we have a major regeneration problem in the area, to reiterate what I said this morning. Erm we are in the current process of reviewing our own or altering our own structure plan, the first alter alteration is going through consultation at the present moment and we're estimating a need within that period of of actually fifteen thousand which is marginally above the regional planning guidance. Erm looking at the figures of migration between Cleveland and North Yorkshire, I received yesterday some figures which which are quite interesting in this respect. Erm perhaps if you've got a pencil handy here. Erm the n the net movements between Cleveland and North Yorkshire as a whole have been respectively for nineteen eighty eight, four hundred and fifty five persons, for nineteen eighty nine, two hundred and twenty nine persons, er for nineteen ninety, two hundred and forty persons, nineteen ninety one, three hundred and thirty seven persons, and for nineteen ninety three, because I missed the figures for ninety two for some reason, they're not there, er five hundred and ninety nine. Erm this gives an average over say a five year period of about a hundred and forty nine dwellings per annum, if you if you divide that by the household er estimate of something like two point five household size, which is the current sort of level in Cleveland. Erm looking interestingly enough, at the Hambleton figures of I understand these are new purchases, which is a bit surprising perhaps, but over a two year period there erm this is table three in Hambleton's submission, there's a reference to the number of erm the origin of house purchases from Cleveland in Hambleton, and it would be seen from there that Cleveland erm produced a hundred and fourteen dwellings, that's purchases of Cleveland residents in the Hambleton area erm in nineteen ninety one to ninety three. That's over a two year period. And er a hundred and seventy one overall in Hambleton. Er sorry a hundred and fourteen in Stoakesly, a hundred and seventy one overall in Hambleton. Which is quite an interesting comparison to make with our own out migration figures. Erm we have er land in the sort of places which compete with Stoakesly although we don't have quite the rural environment, except as was mentioned, at Guisborough. Erm we we aim to get as much development in our area as possible and coming back to your first question this afternoon, I I don't really se any problem with the North Yorkshire proposals, that's the middle range. Erm I do see there would be problems if there's a lot of land released in the Northern part of North Yorkshire and Hambleton, in terms of our meeting our own objectives. Much of the growth that you see reflected in these figures is probably old commitments. And Hambleton are are being more restrained as I said earlier, is appropriate to our own policy. Er our only problem is that some of our housing is concentrated in rather large blocks, and that does put pressure looking for v var variety of sites in the county and we are erm getting a lot of objection for some potential development sites in our area at the present moment. But I don't see any problem, from the figures I've given you, in handling any of those forecasts really when you're talking about a very small proportion in our part of the world compared to the probably the figures that you're talking about around er Leeds, Bradford, Harrogate. I think I'll leave it at that for the moment. Yeah. Er I I know you're submission was was was very clear in in in the sense that you said that you said that the figure proposed by North Yorkshire was would create no problems. Yes. Mr Just a very brief comment, perhaps summing up the and commenting on the various contributions that we've heard so far. Erm I won't really comment on in any detail on on the forty one thousand figure because it's ours and I think we put sufficient justification in for it. Other than to say I've already mentioned er in respect of Mr 's point about his view that no new sites would come forward at forty one thousand, well quite clearly a substantial number of new sites in the residue will come forward, these will be new sites. A more general point on the forty one thousand, again from Mr and Mr , is one I will describe as the er the doomsday scenario which is usually trotted out at er er at debates such as this, erm the effects on affordable housing er and low cost housing. We heard it in nineteen eighty and we heard it again in nineteen eighty seven in pursuance of the House Builders Federation's er views. it wasn't accepted then er and we hope er that it won't be accepted now because the County Council thinks that with the level of provision for migration development, er there is sufficient flexibility within its policy. Commenting on the thirty one thousand, er Mr 's erm er scenario, that the County Council would clearly think this to be erm unreasonable, it would clearly have regional implications er as I said earlier er in my opening remarks er the County Council would accept that it wouldn't be meeting its regional commitments, erm er it would be difficult in practice bearing in mind the level erm of commitment we've got and there may well be local problems in in local housing markets with the level of er of growth er at that level. As far as the H B F's scenario's concerned, this would probably lead to an increase in the building rates above the approved plan of around about fifteen percent. Erm I think that that in the same way as if we went down too low, could be considered to be er a change of strategy and I think what we're about is to try and reflect the currently er approved structure plan strategy. Erm I think there would be environmental problems, I think there would be major problems of sustainability because quite clearly, er scale migration into North Yorkshire would be accompanied in significant past by back out er of North Yorkshire, particularly to Cleveland er and to to West Yorkshire. Mobility in North Yorkshire is increasing dramatically, has increased dramatically over the last ten years and I think there are sustainability arguments against a level erm of provision at fifty er around that level. Erm and a I think quite clearly there would be a conflict with what appears to be currently extent government policy to regenerate er the metropolitan areas of Cleveland erm and West Yorkshire. We think the forty one thousand dwellings give sufficient flexibility erm i it will ensure a substantial continuing house-building sector in North Yorkshire and I think it marries environmental requirements with er the with our wider responsibilities. Thank you very much. Mr Yeah my point is a brief one and i it's coming back to the the question of commitments that was discussed discussed earlier. Er and er the point point was r raised in relation to erm the thirty one thousand figure, that w er you're virtually at that erm commitment level already. That that seems to me to be slightly back to front as as a justification for increasing the figures. Erm in that er surely the the response to that should be well one should m more adequately er control phasing. Erm and and a point was raised in our our evidence given the existing overshoot of structure plan figures, erm the the the county county wide the figures have overshot the agreed structure plan figures, that should focus attention surely on on the need to to more closely control the release of the committed land erm er that is currently without planning permission, through the development control process. I think w w what I'd urge the panel to to consider is is perhaps looking at it from that perspective, to encourage the County Council to review the phasing provision of policy H one erm in terms of er how the the committed land is going to be released for development. Mr Sorry. Sorry pick it up. Can I ask Mr ,to clarify points that you're making is you would like H one to be phased? The there is in in policy H one as proposed at the moment, a the last sentence refers to the issue of phasing. Erm but the the point I'm making is that existing figures erm for the existing sorry the figures for the existing structure plan indicate that there's been an overshoot on agreed figures. And and that to me is indicative albeit er in a small way of a failure to adequately phase the release of land albeit that the figures I accept are are relatively small. Erm logic suggests surely that that erm one should concentrate on the adequacy of the phasing er the existing phasing mechanism, and the words within policy H one and the guidance that the county is giving to the to the district authorities, in how they should phase the release of the committed land. Erm and and I think that is I think you'll agree that's looking at the problem from s from from the other side. Er and not saying that, Well because erm twenty nine thousand er dwellings are already committed, we've therefore got to we've therefore got to provide more, because that will be eaten up fairly quickly. Er that to me suggests that one should focus attention on on the phasing mechanisms for the release of that land. I understand that's the point you're making. What I'm not clear about is whether you are suggesting that the panel, make some strong comments in their report to the County Council on the need for appropriate phasing, or whether the panel should recommend that policy H one be divided into phasing periods. Erm I think I think what I'm suggesting is that the that the the panel should should er advise the County Council as to how they should address the phasing issue. Whether that is done erm well I I I I I don't have an immediate solution as to what what the way in which you may wish to advise the the County Council on how to do that. What I'm suggesting is is that that is perhaps something that the panel should dwell on in their deliberations and their advice to to the county. So I think it it is an issue that perhaps hasn't been addressed in our discussions erm hitherto and and and seems to me from from past evidence to sugg to be an issue that does need to be to be looked at. I see my question's provoked Miss to pick up her name. not to wave it about. Erm can I ask Miss , your view on phasing the structure plan? As I'm sure you probably know better than me Miss , the department blows hot and cold on phasing. Phasing is currently an in word. Again my my personal view is that I think phasing has got a lot a lot going for it but I do not know how you could phase current commitments, because after all those those are on the table now. The wind is warm this week. Mr Thank you. Roy , House Builders Federation. Erm a few comments I'd like to start with with Cleveland and the erm the idea that there's there's there's there's no problem whatsoever in accommodating erm the overspill if I can put it that way or the retention within Cleveland. As I understand it the Cleveland structure plan proposes the same number of dwellings for erm its next period which happens to be fourteen years, as it did for the last fourteen of the of the previous structure plan, fifteen thousand seven hundred. But it's interesting that the distribution of those dwellings is very different. And on the new proposal, the distribution favours Hartlepool as opposed to Stockton-on-Tees. And erm I would suggest that additional favouring of Hartlepool will do nothing whatsoever for the relationship with with North Yorkshire. And in fact Hartlepool is much more related to to Durham than it is to er North Yorkshire. Erm Mr mentioned the issue of building rates and that the proposal by the H B F would be in excess of the building rates. Well yes, of course it would, I submit to you that building rates are in that context are are an irrelevance because erm all that building rates tell you is what's been built in the past. They don't tell you anything about what's needed in the future. I'll come back to the issue of sustainability I think under one B when we get to individual districts, but it does seem to me it's rather overstated. And then Mr then erm dismissed my concerns for affordable supply in that it had all been said before. I wasn't aware that in nineteen eighty and nineteen eighty seven, the government had the same policies it does now. And one of the features of the current policy is that affordable supply is partly a matter to be negotiated and it's very important that it's negotiated out of the general er supply made by private sector builders. The point that I've been making with the various percentages is that those negotiations will become unrealistic if on average, you're talking about forty some percent of sites having to go for affordable housing on a negotiated basis. It simply would not happen. And there will be a shortfall of that amount. Obviously some supply would would occur because housing associations will build wholly on some sites. But as a general rule there w because it has to be negotiated, it would not be er supplied. And erm so I don't think the issues of affordable supply are quite the same as they have been in the past and I think it's a very relevant consideration for this particular structure plan. Thank you Mr . And Mr has been waiting patiently. something you want to go back on? Yes chair. Dave , Leeds City. Er I wanted to come back on the question of regeneration and the opportunities in Leeds. A number of speakers have suggested that er there are vast areas of brown field sites in Leeds just waiting to have houses plonked on them. Which would relieve the need to use er so called green field sites in North Yorkshire. That's not the case. We've exhaustively surveyed Leeds time and again to find these erm so called brown field sites which our own residents suggest are there. And there just there are just not enough in suitable locations for housing, to meet the needs of Leeds. That's why we ourselves have had to take our own greenbelt land. Thank you. Mr are you going to say much the same ? just to erm reiterate the comments for Bradford To point out that er in the deposit U D P, we've been only able to allocate er approximately ten percent of our new allocations in the existing urban area. Thank you. Mr , do you want to tell us about the delights of Hartlepool No I I just want to refute the the point that was made there chairman, because er it isn't er it isn't accurate. Er out of the eighteen thousand two hundred and thirteen dwellings, three hundred and er three thousand one hundred and sixty nine are in Langbar adjoining Cle er North Yorkshire, three thousand two hundred and thirty three dwellings are in Middlesbrough adjoining North Yorkshire, and seven thousand eight hundred and thirty four dwellings are in Stockton, of which four thousand three hundred are at Ingleby which d , directly also adjoins the North Yorkshire boundary, so I I think that I must make that quite clear that the majority of these dwellings provided for in the Cleveland structure plan are erm comparable in terms of er the that area. The only difference is that I suppose er at we have er which is development in North Stockton, we have er erm permission for four hundred erm executive dwellings which is the sort of er market which you could have been looking for at in the past. And we are making provision for executive housing in our area as well as erm er outside the area. In a sense . So effectively what you're saying is a sizable proportion of your proposals are South of the Tees. That's correct. Right. And talking of tea Can we resume at three thirty please. sentence please. Now unless anybody's got a burning desire to pursue the question which I posed at two o'clock, and from my point of view I think we tested it to destruction. Er I'd like to go for some little light relief at this time of the day, and look at sources of supply. Now I I think I would like to ask the county to come in and deal with this question of how much of their forty one thousand two hundred is new build and how much is gonna be taken up or provided by the conversion . Mr ? Malcolm , County Council. I think I'd refer to our paper N Y four, in particular the paragraphs, thirty five to and including thirty seven. Which does indicate that something of the order of twenty five and a half thousand dwellings already committed through completions, outstanding planning permissions and local plan alteration in adopted local plans. Right. And that in addition some three and a half thousand dwellings are contained in draft local plans which have yet to be tested through the the local plan process. Of the remainder which is what Simon er twelve thousand dwellings, the County Council has made no specific on what proportion will be provided through conversions or through windfall sites or small sites. And in the County Council's view this is a matter to be resolved by the district councils in their own plans. The County Council does not have sufficient detailed information on the situation at the local level to be able to comment specifically on individual districts. On the the situation erm in relation to these factors. Can I pursue that Mr please? And you referred to two sorts of allocations, one, those in adopted local plans and the figure was if you could remind me please. Fifteen hundred dwellings. The time scale of those local plans is what please? To ninety six. None of them go beyond nineteen ninety six? No because the structure plan itself as approved only goes to nineteen ninety six. And the time scale of the three point five K? Mostly again to ninety six, although erm some do go beyond. So that in total you're saying twenty nine thousand dwellings, one way or another are committed before nineteen ninety six. Well, in so far as they have planning permission or allocated local plans. Exactly what extent they could be taken up in the period to ninety six, is not necessarily erm clear because we we don't know exactly when those are going to be taken up. That is true, but if somebody applied for planning permission tomorrow or a or a renewal of planning permission, it would be difficult if not impossible to refuse permission for those to be committed . absolutely but that isn't quite the same as actually having been taken up and developed up to ninety six. And in fact the evidence suggests I that in the three years remaining till ninety six, it is most unlikely that those twenty five thousand dwellings will be developed, given the alteration at the present time. Indeed. Thank you. Well as I as I read it the Co you haven't made any allowance for conversions, you've made an assumption that part of the housing figure will be met by conversions. That is correct sir. But you don't wish to put a figure on it. No because I think that is a matter for the local planning authorities in their their local district wide local plans to look at the the way in which they wish to meet the particular totals for their individual districts. They will have a better understanding within their district of the the supply of site property that can be is available for conversion. And local factors which may affect future conversion rates. We do have information on the extent to which net conversions have been provided over the past well during the eighty one ninety Yes I mean I acknowledge that that is rightly a matter for investigation establishment through the local plan system. But nevertheless, how far can you go along towards giving certainty to for example the building industry on the amount of new housing which would come from green field sites for Sorry from the non- conversion element. Well I think the the overall housing figures which were contained in the approved structure plan, made up of a range of sites and allocations. They're made up of small sites, they're made up of windfall sites. The approved structure plan doesn't provide any indication of the way in which that can be broken down. Erm by including conversions this time round I don't see there's any particular difference, we are giving the district a global figure for their districts, which they will then need to look at in the light of local circumstances. I don't see any necessarily any difference by including conversions this time round. If we look at the summary table P S O two,and sticking column two, gives us annual average building rates for nineteen eighty one, ninety three. Our interpretations of that figure excludes any dwellings provided by conversions. But you said, a moment ago that you had some evidence on this. Do you have any idea what the average annual rate is for this? Of conversions? Yeah. Well it is included in in my form. It's part of the appendices . Erm appendix What does it come out at please? Appendix five, the average is three hundred dwellings a year or thereabouts. And is that three hundred included within that figure of two thousand eight hundred and eighty two? Erm Those are those are new build dwellings? Right I'll have to check back against all the figures, if you can just give me a moment. I'll just have to check back I've seen the table in this particular format. It is your figure. Is it? Yes. The two eight eight two yes. Where is the figure taken from? Er the most column G N Y four, appendix three, column average building rates. It excludes conversions. Yes that excludes conversions. Thank you. So that the annual average rate of provision of dwellings in North Yorkshire is something like three thousand one hundred and eighty two dwellings. Including conversions. Including conversions. Thank you. And you wouldn't wish to hazard a guess at all on on the likely contributions co conversions between now and the year two thousand and six. This is something just to absolutely specific about it, which will actually arise out of the work done by the district councils in their local plans. And come up Yes. Coming up with their best estimate. Yes I think they have the the best information to be able to make that decision at a local level. Thank you. Mr ? Sir, a small point in the same vein Stephen ,. I have taken understanding how if the County Council don't have any view on the level of conversions in the future and as I think Mr said also this will extend to small sites and green field developments, how they assess the environmental impact of their figure or indeed anybody's figure, because clearly the environmental impact of conversions is very different from the environmental impact of either recycled urban land or green field development. And if in the County Council's view, they're all equally interchangeable and the anybody, then I fail to see how they can have come to a a view that the maximum acceptable environmental figure is their forty one thousand. Quite Malcolm , County Council. Quite clearly, while I'm not prepared to put a a figure on the contribution that conversions are going to make to the period to two thousand and six, I'll be most surprised if it was a long way different from what has been taking place in the past. We're not talking of a conversion of ten to fifteen thousand dwellings with erm new building being reduced considerably, we are talking something in the order of magnitude of what has been happening in the past. To what extent that will be modified by by the changes in local circumstances, I cannot say. If if we pursued there erm tell me whether I get my arithmetic wrong, er we assume at most three hundred a year from conversions. it's unlikely to be more than that. You don't know. But but let's for the sake It it might It might be more let's for the sake of the discussion assume it's about three hundred a year, then you're looking at another three thousand nine hundred during the remainder of the plan period. For the remainder of the plan period. Or three thousand six hundred. That's right. Which on the basis of commitment, twenty nine thousand, leaves an outstanding figure of just over twelve thousand. No because the figure I quoted did include outstanding planning permissions for conversions. So how many how many how many conversions are there within that ? If you just give me er a moment to check my . About two thousand nine hundred dwellings. Two thousand nine hundred. Yeah. So alright, for the sake of again discussion, we'll say that probably about another thousand might come forward. Although it could be more. Indeed yes, it could be less. It could be more. Erm and if it is more, then the amount coming from new build, Mm. is probably of the order of about ten thousand, eleven thousand at best. Well of that order yes. In addition to the sites that are already allocated or committed. Yes. Mr . Yes thank you. Just on the conversions point,th there will clearly be at the end of the plan period, an outstanding balance of conversion permissions erm which will not be built during the plan period, just as there are two thousand nine hundred er which come back from previous to the well not automatically previous to the plan period, but previous to the position we're in now. Erm I can't see sir, how the districts would be in a better position that the council and the County Council to decide what the conversion element would be. One doesn't allocate the conversions in local plans. The best thing one could do I think is to go back to past trends. And those past trends show about three hundred a year. And I would not suggest that total of three hundred times thirteen should be reduced by the amount of the existing commitment. as I've just said. Erm I think also sir, you if you compare the county's N Y four appendix six, if you'll just look at that. With the county's N Y five appendix three, There isn't an N Y five. N Y five is the H two issue where they H two right. I've got it now . Well it gives a schedule of housing conditions in Greater York erm and I've been comparing in in turn that schedule with the schedule produced by the City Council on a more updated basis. And that actually gives an assumption of net conversion gains in the Greater York area. So it seems to me the exercise not only must be done, for the purpose of calculating where we stand in supply terms, but actually has been done by the County Council in respect of Greater York. So I think the figures should be erm three hundred a year times thirteen. With no reductions. Which is is again just assuming past trends will continue. I can see no better way which to make the make the assessment. Until . Malcolm , County Council. I'm not quite sure what it is Mr is asking. Is Mr asking for a specific figure for net conversions to be included in stage one. It does seem to me that's not entirely consistent to government guidance in P P G three which simply states that the structure plan would state whether or not conversions are included within the housing figures. It does not require that they specifically be separated out. And I'm not quite sure if that would necessarily assist the district councils in the preparation of their district plans. But if if if if you are saying that calculation of housing provision includes conversions, I'm somewhat some guidance on how much provision will have to made from new built sites, and somebody's going to have to make an intelligent assumption about how much is coming forward from conversions. Well certainly the starting point for that must be to look at what has been happening in the past as evidence. But on top of that one must then look into the future, the future supply of such properties, and the future o er of a whole range of issues which may occur locally and which can only really be decided by the district councils in their local plan work. Yeah I I I mean I got the point, but er where does it take the building industry or the district. The districts obviously will do their assessments through the local plan . Well absolutely I mean this is the way that things have always worked and the County Council makes a global assessment of requirements for a particular district and the district council then takes it forward with assumptions on small sites, windfall sites er and major allocations that they may be mad making. Er conversions are simply a different factor they will have to take into account. I don't see any difference in principle simply that this is an additional point they will have to take in account in their their local plan preparation. This may be also a question which you will say the districts are in a better position to answer and maybe they should be forewarned that if you say that, they will be asked that question. Do you have a feel of how much of the total provision that you're proposing in the structure plan will be development on green field sites as opposed to development existing urban areas? Er Malcolm , County Council. No I don't w we've never attempted to define development in those terms. Erm strictly in those terms by by district, mainly because much of the development across North Yorkshire is on very small sites er within urban areas, within villages, the extent to which you define them as green field or brown field sites becomes a very subjective one and I I think it's a very difficult line to draw. Erm and we we have never attempted to define it in quite those terms. Mm. But this if I may pick up on the point Mr made, how then do you assess the environmental impact of what you're proposing if you don't actually know where it's going to go? But the environment The environment in North Yorkshire is not just confined to the green field sites, it is also confined to the the small villages, the market towns. And the character of those towns is also erm subject to pressure from development on what might be described as brown field sites and could adversely affect the character of those settlements themselves. Just as readily as by gr er green field sites. I'm still lost for what in effect is the answer to Mr 's question. How did the County Council assess the environmental impact of forty one point two K new dwellings. The County Council took into account a wide range of considerations, in including the the information that came through from the local plan authorities, in the preparation of their local plans over the past ten years or more. On the problems and opportunities that they faced allocating land throughout the county. Erm the County Council is well aware of the problems they faced and the issues that have arisen out of those local plans and took those into account in the preparation of the structure plan alterations. But the essence of your answer to the questions that have been asked over the last twenty minutes or so, is we haven't done it that way. Mm. With which I'm left with an impression that you don't actually know where the dwellings are going to go in general terms. How many are coming from conversions, how many are coming from green field as opposed to brown field sites. What basis what did you have therefore for your assessment that forty one thousand two hundred was okay? Well I don't think you can expect the County Council and the structure plan authority to have an idea of where the allocations are going because that would be taking on the role of the local plan preparation authority. Er the County Council cannot look at an individual building and say, this is a particular piece of land which is going to be developed and this is going to have this particular impact on the environment. But No I didn't expect you that you would have the answer to those questions at the level of villages, however I think it might be reasonable to expect that in reaching your view, primarily on environmental grounds, which is the major flank of your argument for suppressing past migration trends. As part of that appraisal, you would have taken some view. The alternative is that and I'm being provocative quite deliberately, I am left with an impression that what the County Council have done is add together input from district councils to prepare its structure plan. Well there's certainly been one element of the the input to the preparation of the structure plan, but there has also been some independent view on the the capacity and the the environmental problems that individual districts across North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire have in their ability to accommodate development, and on the pressure and the problems that those pressures of development will have on those individual districts, bearing in mind the environmental constraints identified both in National and in the Secretary of State's previous approval of the structure plan. What were those environmental parameters? I think the County Council looked at government guidance in relation to the need to protect and safeguard National Parks, greenbelt, high quality agricultural land,to the need to protect the countryside for its own sake. Er there is a range of government advice on the sort of areas which need to be protected. Er it also takes into account the government's advice on the need to protect the environment and the . Did you make any quantified ? Not in the sense that the County Council went out and did a measured assessment which said, Right this particular district can accommodate X thousand dwellings in areas which aren't greenbelt or which are greenbelt or individual factors. It was based on their general experience and their general local knowledge of the problems and opportunities and constraints on particular areas. Mr . Yeah going to seek to fill in the spaces in your columns J and K since if you find that helpful. And to explain them. Er Scarborough. Is that right? Er dealing first of all with conversions, er J . We've got a figure there of six ninety and for the windfall sites, five seventy. If I can just erm refer to our previous experience of er conversions which I think is probably a little peculiar given the nature of a seaside resorts. Erm for instance in the period eighty nine to ninety two, we were running at an annual average of about a hundred and seventy four conversions a year. However the average, seventy seven to ninety two, er gives you a figure of eighty five. Now given the nature of the coastal economy and what has happened to us in the last ten years or so, we have calculated our conversions through to two thousand and six on a reducing level. On the basis that a lot of the big houses that were doing holiday accommodation and so on, er have have already been converted and this is our experience, so on that basis we have taken a reduced figure for conversions and that is basically the reasoning behind it. Now er thereafter you say well why six ninety and not seven ten. Er clearly the we have to you have to make a judgement on this. But that is the reasoning behind it. Similarly, er we have actually er taken something of the same attitudes towards windfall sites within the urban areas. Because a great many have developed in recent years. And taking up points about town cramming. So er I'm giving you that as an example, but I think that Scarborough will be atypical of the county as a whole because of the nature of the Victorian property and the holiday industry. Thank you. Mr ? Er could I just return to to the line of questioning very briefly that the Senior Inspector was was pursuing a moment ago with with the County Council, in terms of the assessment of the environmental impact that the forty one thousand figure. I mentioned in in my first contribution this morning a a concern about that those considerations that environmental considerations, even if they have been fully considered er are not there's not an explanation provided anywhere in in the structure plan supporting material as to how that's actually been achieved. However there there is there is I think some re there are relevant sections in in the county council document N Y eleven, which follows on which is the the county's as I understand it rebuttal to to the H B F's assumptions on erm the environmental constraints and how they should apply across the county. Erm the the impression I'm left with I must admit is that that that the cart has followed the horse if that's right in that erm the environmental justification for the figures has been retrospective. Erm I think, C P R E we feel we say this in our opening statement to our evidence that it should be the other way round. Er and in in indeed government guidance is is is states exactly that. I don't know if it's something through through the panel, it's the been put to the County Council as to whether I my interpretation of of the process is correct. Well well perhaps Peter , North Yorkshire. Perhaps I could er develop erm erm the position a little bit further. Erm any suggestion that erm the figures that we're putting before this E I P have appeared out of the blue, er we would wish to er refute quite categorically. I you look at the County Council, the County Council is the National Park Authority. That covers about half of the erm of the county. Erm local plan progress is is well advanced erm er in the national parks and that has been the subject of continued discussion erm between the county and its national park committee, the county planning committee and its national park committee. There have been numerous meetings er between the district, the county and the national park committee on the problems of environmental capacity within those areas. The County Council also manages work on er A U M Bs the two main A U M Bs in the county. And the county's well versed in the problems within the A U M Bs. The County Council er together with its district council colleagues er has also spent five years looking at the problems in Greater York. There's another area, a substantial chunk of the county which has been explored ad nauseam in terms of er environment. When you then look at the bits that are left over, erm we've got Hambleton District Council which has er had the er er earliest I think local running down the centre of the county. There's been close liaison between er the county and Hambleton. We've an adopted local plan for that p part of Selby district outside the Greater York area, so already we've covered ad infinitum by by various assessments. Quite clearly the county's spent a lot of time assessing environmental capacity and environmental problems within North Yorkshire. And you can add to that the fact that a number of districts er have said that they've been consulted five times by the County Council er on various erm population projections. Quite clearly there's been full well perhaps too much too much discussion, consultation, assessment and implications right the way through the the preparation of this operation. The County Council is soundly based in pursuing a figure er of forty one thousand dwellings. Mr ,and partners. It seems to me there's there's a very circular argument that that's been applied to this question of environmental constraint. We we heard just now from the the County Council, that they have looked at Hambleton's district wide local plan, looked at the constraints in that back to Hambleton effectively as housing requirement. Rather than establishing at a strategic level housing requirements, so that local plans being formulated can weigh those housing requirements against environmental constraints. Because at the end of the day, it is essential that a balance is struck between meeting housing needs and conserving environment. That can be illustrated by a complete lack of information in front of us on the that that actually applies any consistency to er the the environmental discount applying in different parts of the county. I'm looking at the helpful assessment provided by Selby in A seven double O four. Their appendix three. And that sets out for each district in the County a few areas of different environmental constraints. National Parks,, greenbelt and so on. There is absolutely no correlation between those figures and the degree of constraint that has been applied on districts. For instance if you look at Selby, at forty two percent of its area constrained, and a high housing value requirement. If you with Hambleton, forty four percent, with a very constrained housing requirement, a seventy percent constraint. I think you may say they're they're different districts and and Selby is constraint is all greenbelt. You can compare Ryedale and Hambleton, which are not very different. Ryedale has more a higher proportion of National Park, A O M B, local landscape designation and greenbelt than Hambleton but is unconstrained. I just do not see that any logic can be applied in this process at all. Yes Mr Yeah,, Samuel Smith's brewery, Tadcaster. Erm to echo the point that Mr has made, I also regard this erm the environmental assessment as unsatisfactory with its particular interest in Selby. And er I note that Selby has accepted or resolved to accept the increased allocation from ten thousand to eleven thousand five hundred, subject to the District Council satisfying itself that the level of growth envisaged can be achieved without compromising the established structure plan strategy or the environment of the district. And it seems to me as Mr said, it's putting the cart before the horse really. The it's no use accepting a level of housing and saying, We'll accept that subject it not damaging the environment. What should be done is the level of housing allocated to Selby should be assessed in terms of whether it can be satisfactorily accommodated, and if it can't then it shouldn't be allocated. If it can, it it should be allocated. But this the way it's it's er accepted here is completely unacceptable in my view. Mr ? Stephen from . Sir I very much share the best I think doubts that were evident in Miss 's questions about whether there is any real environmental assessment on which the county figure's based. Either a county or indeed at a rational comparative district level. I prior to this E I P read through N Y four, very closely, looking for this. And I counted the word environment and environmental, forty five times and not one scraptwo thousand and Comment Perhaps Mr can confirm whether he was present when the county planning committee considered on I think three or four occasions, the er the various range of projections. Were you present Mr . My colleagues were present sir and have informed me that the comment that I made is actually accurate. I wouldn't accept that. There were a range of meetings, some private meetings with district councils when they've given the opportunity to discuss issues erm themselves, and quite clearly our members did in fact look at a whole range of projections before coming to a final view. Quite clearly it was a thorough examination and members had before them at both county and district level, the implications er of the various projections. And er they took the decision erm to erm pursue the policies er as as as set out in this E I P. Mr do you want to throw some light on this ? Yes er yes thanks chairman. Nice to get into that even if it is almost as er night watchman. Terry Selby District Council. You can continue your innings tomorrow you know. Well I hope that won't be necessary. Erm reference has been made er a couple of times to the appendix which I attached to my submission, that's the map and the schedule of strategic constraints, I feel I ought not to let it pass without some comment. Er and basically that's I'm beginning to feel that I've thrown in a bit of a red herring here. Erm the only purpose of the information presented is to establish the differences in strategic terms between the the districts in in the county. I feel that is an appropriate er investigation which is being done by the county and and the district jointly. And I think it does demonstrate that in comparison with other parts of North Yorkshire, Selby is in fact much less constrained. Er and I really wouldn't like more to be read into it than than that. Er Mr also commented om the er consideration of the er emerging alteration and increase in Selby District's allocation from ten thousand to eleven and a half thousand dwellings erm and I would like to assure him now that we have completed out local plan studies, we are in the process of fine tuning them and and I'm quite confident that we will be able to accommodate the eleven and a half thousand dwellings. I wonder given Selby's recent experience with their local plan, whether they can enlighten us as to how they have reached a view that the structure plan provision in right in environmental terms for their district. Well g er going back to to my starting point that the relative environment of Selby the vis a vis the rest of North Yorkshire erm it's a point which I'm sure I'll repeat in in in the coming days and it's it's basically that Selby in comparison with other districts in North Yorkshire is significantly different.

Well one subject that I think a lot of us shy away from, is mental illness. And we don't seem to be very tolerant in our society, of people who are a bit different. Part of the problem is that most of us don't know very much about mental illness and we tend to see very negative images around us and on television. Something like schizophrenia for instance is widely misunderstood. Even the idea that people have a split personality isn't strictly true. Now this coming September there's going to be a mental health awareness week, but if you'd like to get involved before that, then the Nottingham branch of the , want to encourage anyone who's interested to visit them. Now their motto is, A positive response to mental illness, and are heavily involved in the awareness week.

A car is stolen every minute, and the frightening reality is that your car could be next. If you leave your car, even if not for long, you should be taking necessary precautions. Always lock your car whenever you leave it, even if only for a moment. If you have an alarm or security devices, remember to set them, and close all windows. Also have your windows etched with the registration or vehicle identification number. This will deter the car thief. Remove all personal belongings from the car when you leave. And it's also important to never leave young children or animals in a parked car, because if windows are closed, there is a grave danger of suffocation. I myself know only too well what it's like to have a car stolen, so as a car is one of our most valuable possessions, it pays to take care of it at all times.

Now it seems to me that er Yeltsin's that kind of Russian patriot and he's shown it by concluding treaties as equal partners with Ukraine, with the Baltic Republics and so on er in which he said that er Russia is no longer going to interfere in their internal affairs, so they they are equal partners in these treaties. So that. But that that contradicted today, when he's not only threatened to intervene against the Republics that have been attacking their minorities but erm, since he's become Russian president he's constantly threatened and the area of and you know denied it sort of national . I think the the key point about patriotism is one reason why perhaps people in, in Britain and so on shouldn't be patriotic too, but if you see the rather cynical attitude of the Western countries towards recent events, not just in Russia but right across the Eastern block,very good example was condemned, erm but when, following the massacres erm, the West has gone on to sort of do deals with the winners and cultivate links er with the people responsible for that massacre, the killing of the Soviet Union went the other way and consequently erm that's where you know Western resources are directed. I'm sure if the hardliners have won, now that is erm,would be dealing with them just as now. There is a human characteristic that we like to think, see things in, in very clear cut ways and you're saying we shouldn't go overboard and just think that Boris Yeltsin because of his courage standing on the tank and, and helping to prevent the coup, we shouldn't go overboard and think that he's er the most marvellous human liberal democrat who ever walked the earth. I think, I think we should see it for what it is, which is a power struggle inside a ruling elite in the Soviet Union for which we don't really have an interest in taking sides. Er, of course er, Yeltsin does sometimes take own measures and that's because the situation genuinely is very dangerous er and er, I think that everyone would agree that really. Anthony Kenny from Essex, what's your view on this? Good morning Nick. Hello. Nice to speak to you, erm, I'd just like to say that er, take me now as a, as a normal chap from England who looked across right through his life at Russia as the big bad bear and eight years ago I had the opportunity of going over there, just an ordinary chap and er, of course , there's so much about the Soviet Union we don't know, we did, we, erm, for instance we were over there in 1982 when they were celebrating sixty years of the incorporation of the saints into the Soviet Union. And I didn't even realise at that time that there were fifteen states in the Soviet Union. Now we travelled the best part of the Ukraine and we also dipped into and er we were there about a month, just under a month, and erm one of the impressions that I got there, just as an ordinary chap, no, not learned politically so I can't speak on the level er of most of your callers today, but er, I realise that here you had er people, in actual fact my my comment was the country's half finished, everywhere you went there were building constructions so far incomplete, er projects underway and you've got the impression that they did need communism in a way to make the thing work er, the er, let's take the Ukrainians, I mean that, that's where the Cossacks come from and they love a good time, er those sort of people in a way need a strong government. Are you, you saying that things could get worse now that erm communism is gone and is going to become even more impoverished . What I'm saying, yeah . You've got it in one. What I, what er, I in fact, what, what I did notice in that time that I was there, was that er, when you talk about the old guard, the young people, anybody under forty er they were a little bit cynical about this communism lark and Lenin and the rest of it, they all went to say,they would all go to Lenin's er statue and in effect have a blessing from Lenin, we went along with them on one occasion, very pleased to do it, but you you got the impression that the younger generation were already in 1982 and the people now that are out there with Yeltsin were shying away from communism, now the thing is this that Gorbachev came along in my opinion exactly at the right time and tried to move things a little our way a little way from the hardline, which obviously couldn't be sustained. And perestroika has actually caused economic problems not, not resolved them. Yeah, you're right, and that's what I'm saying, they have tried and I think they've let Gorbachev down. Let me put this to Geoffrey Hoskin, Professor Hoskin we've heard of a people ruled by Tsars and then by , is there going to be any thing but anarchy now? Will democracy really work? Well of course there isn't very much of a democratic tradition in Russia that's quite true, but that's very different from of the Russians and all the Soviet people and saying they're simply incapable of living under democracy. Any nation has to learn democracy er, and it seems to me that all the people of the Soviet Union have shown over the last four or five years a lively interest in politics and considerable to participate in politics, er one of the problems is of course is that they've been doing so, too much and in too disorganised a way, they're going to have to get together . That's what I'm saying , they need, they need just a little, in fact we do here you could argue, er, I feel that all the elements there are of a turning into something a bit ugly, I think, I think they were very quick to drop those statues down, now I know, I know the fellow who in, who set up the K G B could have been the most popular bloke in the Soviet Union, but nonetheless, er he was down within a day, I hear this morning that Yeltsin's talking about border changes and quite frankly they're moving too quick and Gorbachev at least was providing a bit of restraint, and I think it, they want to think in terms of decade. Ian Ian Cuthill from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, are you also concerned about instability there? I certainly am. Erm I'd liked to discuss the point about what aid we can give to try and promote the stability and the event of prosperity of the country. Now the present British government is very anxious to give the Russians our financial expertise rather than practical help to promote a market economy. You think our financial expertise doesn't amount to practical help? I certainly don't, because erm, according to this policy the first thing the Russian people have got to put up with is a high level of unemployment. Now I suggest that we . We've become quite expert at that haven't we? Er, this is the point I'm going to make, this is absolute hypocrisy. I mean after thirty years of policies our own real economy is shambles, growing unemployment. Now I suggest that er don't you, it's vast numbers of Russian people milling about with nothing to do is certainly not going to promote stability. What the Russians want is technical help and equipment, now our own industry is in decline er yes, particularly in machine tool industry, and I think the first thing we should do is to go over there and see what it is they actually needed, what they actually need right now, er one of your previous er correspondence, er speaker turned round and said well they've got half finished buildings and things like that, I mean er, people have got to be put to work because people in co-ordinate employment is the only source of real wealth, but the market economy isn't interested in promoting real wealth, I mean it's only interested in what it can get out of an economy not what it gives . If, if were going to give them transfer real wealth, machine tools and all the rest. Yeah. How's it going to be paid for? Are we going to divert er an aid programme from the third world to prevent people starving and so forth to the Soviet Union or are we going to have er funds from the National Health Service, from Education, who's going to find the money? Erm, is the money really, erm, this is, I think this is a bit of a bogey. A country can produce these days as much money as it wants. Only, only if it creates inflation. Er, yes, but if you're exporting the stuff why should it create inflation? I mean this is the the cause of inflation surely is to have more, too much money taken too few goods and if you produce more goods this helps to deflate, er we didn't have inflation thirty years ago. Well this is a marvellous new form of economics, if we could just create things and er export them without getting paid for them and it wouldn't us. That's right. We could . We could because the sense of wealth is people at work have people scratching their backsides doing nothing erm is absolute, er you know is lunacy. But the . The fundamental point that you make is we shouldn't be simply offering good advice or, or bad advice, we should be offering real aid, real goods. That's right. And doing so for the goods . Er the goods that what, not goods that we want to give them like junk food and ludicrous fashions, to find out what it is that they want this of equipment and no, and don't forget the know-how, I mean we are, we have a hell of a Know-how in this country which is not being used. Okay. Let me get to Somerset to and Commander Michael Blake, are you a Naval Commander incidentally? Yes, I'm retired. Er, do you think we should er give substantial aid to the Soviet Union? Well the er point I'd like to make is that as of last Saturday the er, erm, the Soviets were building a new submarine every forty days, they're spending thirty five percent of the G N P. on armaments and erm, I, wouldn't it be prudent to insure that erm they stop spending all this money on armaments before any aid is given to them? I thought it was twenty five percent of their it's a big sum anyway. No, I ,it's an enormous sum I mean I don't think anybody in the West is spending er as much as ten percent on armaments and er I heard a on television not so long ago saying that in eighty percent of their industry is on armaments. Geoffrey Hoskin. Yes, I think that we could actually kill as it were two birds with one stone here er, the conversion of military industry into civilian industry has begun in the Soviet Union but it was going very slowly and part of the reason for that is, is it's very expensive, now that seems to me a worthy recipient for Western direct economic aid. But another reason is presumably in the past, because the military was terribly powerful, much more powerful before the coup than now and Gorbachev was frightened to start dismantling it too . Precisely that's why this is an excellent moment to offer precisely that kind of aid because those obstacles have been largely removed. So Commander Blake we should not just offer a stick saying that we we aren't going to help you until we start dismantling your military programme, we should offer carrots too, do you agree? Well I, I I, I don't mind how it's done but erm I hear nothing on the many people on, you know, who talk about erm giving aid erm a dread from this problem is this vast erm amount of the G M P and going on armaments and going on one way and another. I would have thought they've simply, it had to be agreed that that was stopped and then as the professor has said, I mean we give all the aid we can to turn their erm military er industry into erm, what was it,instead of guns. We move to another caller from in Surrey. What's your prospective on this? Well I really feel very uneasy about present events in Russia and er, particularly on a simplification on world politics what on . I just feel in an absence of a Russian from the balance of power gonna leave the, the arrogance of the United States totally unchecked. When you say, talk about the Middle East, are you from that part of the world? I am from Iraq, yes. From, from Iraq. Yes. Erm, interesting, president Saddam Hussein has er also deplored er the ending of the coup and the fact that er Gorbachev has backed . Let me, let me interrupt you here, I must support Saddam Hussein, I don't believe he carried his own policies, I'm concerned about the Iraqi people themselves. You know I mean this has, this has been used accused Saddam Hussein has er is a, is a supporter of er the coup, but er, the real implication I am talking about is the problem. Hm, hm. I think the solution here is, a, a, a,and er future will be totally unbalanced. You raised a very, very significant issue that I haven't heard much addressed in recent days and we know that there hasn't really been a super power of the Soviet Union and any other military sense for the last couple of years. He has, he has since the Gulf War. I mean look at, look at the conduct of the Gulf War. Absolutely, and this is again having enormous implications particularly in the entire world. . And now you, you gonna have the whole resources will be totally controlled by one super power . Geoff Geoffrey Hoskins is it a good thing that we no longer we have too super pow powers viewing for authority and all the rest of it or are you as worried as ? On the whole I think it's a, a good thing, er it's only five or six years ago that an historian called Paul Kennedy published a book saying that America was in decline as a super power, er and in fact I think what's happening is that er, there are, there are going to be clusters of super powers now in the world and they're all more modest than American and the Soviet Union were a few years ago. There's the United States, there's Europe, Western Europe, plus central Europe now, there's Japan and there will be the Ex-Soviet Union in some form, er those arrangements will be complicated, but they will be less ca cataclysmic as it were, the danger will no longer be of Armageddon, there'll be very serious, could be very serious conflicts that could arise. just come back. I don't agree at all. Sorry. I don't agree at all. Do you not think that up to now Middle Eastern countries and some other nations and people as well have been of the super powers in their giant struggle against each other, but now the United States may be able to take er, if you like a more mature and more relaxed attitude. Maybe. I am sorry I d d, I agree with you on one one point that the Middle Eastern er, er government that of the super power from, from the reception, but what really happened in the Gulf War is a typical reflection of the injustice of how the war was being conducted. It was conducted in a in a devastating effect because was totally unchecked and America got the upper hand and they simply played the game by their own favour without giving due consideration to humanitarian or, or even the justice er element and this, this is how the world's gonna be, and America is an arrogant super power. What's . It's certainly something we're all gonna have too er adjust too, thank you for pointing it out that the United States is going to have such enormous influence er from, from now on, we're all going to have to get used to it and er get used to how to deal with it. from, from Coventry, what do you feel about what's been happening in the Soviet Union. Well the thing that concerns me is the readiness in which er rushing to ban the communist party. I would rely on Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev that the only possible way in which they could have reached the eminence they have today is through membership of the party. There must be many, many able Russians who take the same line as the only way forward could be incorporated in a democratic Russia and very, very substantially contribute to its recovery. you you, you've been a communist yourself? Let me give you my family history shall I? Oh, oh, if you can do it in a sentence. I'll do it very quickly. I am the great grandson of the founder of what is now the greatest, one of the greatest in, in Leningrad. My name is as you know and company that found these was which was my Uncle and , well erm, about Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev to lead a Russian political book and I could which was the name of the company today. Now in this book they will read that the progressive forces of the late eighteen hundreds and the early nineteen hundreds will endeavour to educate the workers from the er, mythological and textile industries were not basically communists. Let, I . But were social democrats . Forgive me I don't want to go back that far, but, but let me just put the point you've made to Professor Hoskins. The communist party should not be banned, it is true that many members of it did support er an coup, on the other hand so many people joined the communist party for advancement and it's not very democratic to ban a party which has had su such power and such membership. Well first of all it hasn't been banned er a suspended it while it's role in the coup . Disband it . Just a moment, suspended it and then Gorbachev, his first secretary has the right to do it, disband the central committee and then what lower party er bodies do is up to them. However what, what I think is the most important aspect of this, the communist party is not and never has been a party in the normal sense of the term, it's a closed shop for the ruling establishment of the Soviet Union and therefore it's quite simply incompatible with politics. Eighteen months ago it gave up its monopoly of politics but it continued to exist and it continued really as a kind of dog in the manger to prevent the er establishment of normal multi-party politics. Therefore it seems to me that the communist party really has to disappear, it's a good thing that it's own general secretary has disbanded it, I anticipate that it will break up into a number of political parties, perhaps one kind of social democratic party on the left and another, if you like a kind of Russian unionist party, on the right, erm, but as the communist party it's simply incompatible with the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Union. Let's move on if I may to Dr. Nora Worcester calling from Cambridge. Hello. Hello Dr. Worcester what do you feel about all this? Well, er, I became er, unhappy with the communist party many years ago because it didn't follow the philosophical teaching on which works, the erm, erm, dialectical materialism. They said that in a political situation, if you had one side you could call it the thesis, say capitalism was the thesis and communism was the other side and that was the antithesis and that these two would one another and it was only when they came together and got their good points both of them adopted, that one was really going to get a satisfactory solution. Do you think we've got a satisfactory solution in the Soviet Union? Some kind of social democracy in Russia, erm on the other hand in central Asia as for example, I think it's quite likely that former communists, although they may disavow their former allegiance, will in practice take over as national communist parties and continue to run their economies, well there will be private economies but with a large state sector and run on a pretty tight reign. So I think the, the answer is we're going to see a variety of things, there is a tendency I think amongst er Soviet Citizens at the moment to regard the market economy as they used to regard communism, that's to say there's a kind of ideal which will bring about universal prosperity, and relief on all their worries. There is a certain danger there, cos in fact er, the market economy in some ways is not as pleasant as, as that suggests. Hazel Clarke from Okehampton. I, I've been in Germany recently, selling., I took a number of our British products over and I saw half a ton of my cheeses in the German supermarket. Also while there I was working from eight in the morning till seven at night. I was able to talk to the German customer and the people on the floor, who are excessively worried about the number of people coming in from the East, not only East Germany but they're very, very worried about people coming in from Eastern Europe, and secondly there was so much East European food that was for sale in Germany at very low prices and there's food that used to go to the Soviet Union. Now it's made the people, I have friends in Moscow, who are saying that they are losing a lot of their food supplies, because the West are taking the most throw down prices so that the Yugoslavs and the Romanians can get the goodies they want for us. Throw down the prices from the West but of course good high real foreign currency for Soviet Union. Exactly, but also it was food for them. Hm, hm. And they are losing their tradition of the food that they have been getting from Eastern Europe. So what can be done? I, I think that we, it's really like taking chocolate from the mouths of babies, to take food from people in Eastern Europe who are rather desperate. It really, we need to encourage the trade that Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and if it, one of the former speakers said, we need to give them aid and ascent for people who can, erm, show them what to do. They need the technical help. Actually,the speaker that was talking about this was suggesting we give them an enormous amount of real tangible assets, er without it costing us anything. Now I know, know of no law of economics which would permit that, would you be prepared for us to pay a lot out of tax payers' resources to give to the Soviet people, to help their economy, to to help them survive this very difficult transition period? I don't think it's so much monies that they need. What they need is certain products. It, it comes to the same thing doesn't it?. And I un well as I understand it from, from, from the friends in Moscow their, their traditional industries are very archaic, they may have erm, the expertise in, in the armament section, but the other things, what they need is some of our engineers and we've got a lot of engineers who were working overseas and at the moment aren't. If we could send some of the people over there, to help them to retrain things and reorganise things. So, Professor Hoskins that would be a relatively cheap way, it'll still cost money, but relatively cheap way of, of, of really helping these . It would be a relatively cheap way, and other things we could also get European Community, this isn't a British problem it is a world problem. Yes, Professor Hoskin . Yes, yes we have got some unused resources that could be er, er, diverted towards the Soviet economy, food surpluses for example, the coming winter is going to be very difficult in the Soviet Union and I think direct food aid may well be necessary. We don't have to worry as much as we used to about its being misused by the party state apparatus for corrupt erm, then of course there's, them, the, the, the problem of longer term aid, how we help the Soviet Union integrate itself into the world economy. This is undoubtedly an all European problem, United States, Canada, Japan, everyone else should be involved, er I think we should probably identify with the Soviet's aid and help, hm, key projects like the conversion of military industry into consumer goods, er, like transport and communications, key areas of the economy where relatively small amounts of investment could produce big returns, and then finally it seems to me we should be extending to the Soviet Union for membership of er, international financial organisations like the world bank and the international monetary fund, whichever in criteria of course for helping countries and for integrating international aid to those countries. Graham calling from in Sussex, is it the economic aspects that concern you most? Yes, well the economic effect on our own country, well when I say under, er Europe, er, with this proposal that er, we have to open up our markets er for the benefit of the Soviet, er because, that is going to cost er, what they're, what they're asking for, not only in Soviet but also across Eastern Europe is that the agricultural market, the steel, and the textile market, all the most sensitive areas, should be opened up to them, and that's going to shed a, a great increase in unemployment er within the, within the common market. Are you a good old fashion protectionist? No, not at all, er, but I, I, I, am someone who believes you've got to have level playing fields, which we do not have, er or won't have, er with the implementation of the common market er, regardless of any relationship with the Soviet Union in 1992, er after all to, what has not been published very much, er is that , you know, got to take into account indirect as well as direct and erm, if you look at for instance the United States er which is constantly packing the common market people, which is of course , er I'm, I'm going to have to cut you off, cos we're running out of time, but I very much take the point you're making, that it could've had this trade effect on us, just in the last ten seconds Professor Hoskin, is it possible to predict what's going to happen in the Soviet Union over the next six months, is it gonna be for good, or, or,. It's quite unusually unpredictable at the moment. I think the long term results of this are entirely good, but in the short term there's going to be major instability, making life possibly quite nasty for everyone. Professor Hoskin, and to all of you who called and listened, thank you until next Tuesday, bye, bye. Just thinking what we'll start off with. I think I'll give you some homework that you could do for the week. So it'll be Right. based on, what we do today will be based on Okay. technical names of notes and intervals. Things like that. Don't, can't remember whether we actually any of the technical names of the of the scale before? No. How many notes are there in a scale? Eight. Right. So each one of those is going to have a a name of its own Yeah. with the first and last of course are gonna be called the same thing. And it's the tonic. You, you've probably heard that name before. Tonic. Because I think we've probably Yeah. talked about tonic chords and things like that. Tonic is the first degree of the scale. So in the key of C major C will be the tonic. Er now the next note second is called the supertonic. It's immediately above the tonic. And so would that be like D? That, that would be D. Or in the key of G it would be A. A. And so on. The mediant is the third degree of the scale Yeah. and it's called mediant because it lies exactly half way between the first note and the fifth note which is also a very important note in the scale, which we'll come to in a minute. So mediant is the third and it lies between, it's in the middle in other words. Subdominant again is the fourth. And I'll explain why in a moment. Fifth is the dominant. It's, it's a very important note. Dominant means that it's important doesn't it? Yeah. Er and then the submediant, because it lies halfway between the upper tonic the eighth note of the scale and the subdominant. So that, that's called the submediant. And then the mediant is called the mediant, the mediant because it lies halfway between the tonic and the dominant. So you've got the mediant between one and five. Submediant between Between eight and four. And that actually shows you slightly better. That little diagram. If C is the tonic, G is the dominant, so in the middle comes the mediant. And think of that as the upper tonic. And that would be F would be the fourth degree. So that becomes submediant. Right. And seventh note is the leading note because it's leading you up to the tonic again. Tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant. The lower dominant in other words and it's Yeah. called subdominant because it's, it's five notes below the upper tonic. So the dominant is five notes above the tonic and the subdominant is five notes below the tonic. Right. Yeah. If you like underneath the lower one. Mhm. That jus if, if you can keep the th the descriptions in your mind as well it just helps you to, to remember why each one is called that. Yeah. Okay and in fact I've given you part of your homework is to write out the technical names. With a very brief explanation of, of why. And you can use this little book for now. I think, I think we've got one of those You may have one of these. at home certainly. So you can use use that can't you? I'll put the page numbers so you'll be okay there. The other thing I'm going to talk about are intervals. I can't remember whether in grade it was three you did wasn't it? Yes you've had to do intervals in oral tests haven't you? So you know things like major second, major thirds. Erm perfect fourths and perfect fifths? Did you have to go as far as that? No. No. No we didn't. Right. Okay. Let's refer back to C major scale because it's the nice easy one. It's all white notes. So there's nothing to worry about as far as sharps or flats go. There's ei the, the eight notes of the C major scale. C to D is a second. There are two notes involved so we call it a second. And that's a major second because it comes in a major scale. So it's C to D, A major second. C to E C to E major third. Major third. Miss out fourth and fifth for a moment. Go t to A. C to A? Major sixth. And C to B? B major seventh. Is a seventh. And then we've got an octave. Right. The fourths and fifths aren't called major. They're called per perfect fourth, perfect fifth. Right? Yeah. The reason for that is because those two notes also come in the minor scale. Alright? I know the D does as well but the fourths and the fifths always remain perfect. Okay? So you say major second, major third, perfect fourth and fifth, major sixth, major seventh, and octave. It's actually called a perfect octave but they never worry about the perfect when you're talking about an octave. But it is actually called a perfect octave as well. Okay. Besides the major intervals you've got minor intervals. If you think about C minor scale. You'd have C D E flat F G F G A flat. A flat. The key signature actually has a B flat in it but because in a harmonic minor if you remember you raise that a semitone that's a B natural going to C. Now you still have a major second but you have a minor third which makes it minor scale doesn't it? Yeah. And a minor sixth. But you've still got the perfect fourth and fifth. You've still got the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth. Right. Now with all the oth other intervals you can also have minor seconds, minor sixths and minor sevenths. Which is why they're not called perfects. You can't have minor fourths and fifths. So fourths and fifths just remain perfects. Any idea what you do to make all of these other intervals in to a minor interval apart from those two? What happened to the third to make it a minor? Lowered a semitone. Right. So if you do the same thing with a D. Erm. You have C to D flat. D flat. That becomes a minor second. Right. There's the minor third with E flat. Fourths and fifths you don't have minors. You don't have. Right Now. That's the sixth. Minor sixth. The seventh to make it minor you would B flat. put a B flat in. And that gives you the other minor interval. So you've then got a minor second, a third, a sixth and a seventh. Right. Now all of the intervals also have what is called an augmented interval and a diminished interval. What do you think a diminished interval will do? To a minor interval. Erm What, what happens if you diminish something? You put it down. Right so it gets smaller. Yes. And if you augment something? It gets bigger. It gets bigger. Right. So. You've taken that down a semitone to to make it minor. To make it diminished you just take it down another semitone. Take it down another semitone. In fact you So wouldn't hear any difference between that So. Yes it's C C. and, but you must call it D double flat. Because it Oh right. must have, if it hasn't got another letter name then it's not a second is it? Yeah. So C to D double flat. It'll sound the same note. So you can only see it on paper. You can only, you, you wouldn't know that it you were hearing a C to a C, you wouldn't know you were actually hearing a diminished second would you? Because it's the same note . Right. What about Would they would they write it like that in the music? It would be written like that sometimes if It would. yo if they're changing key Yeah. they might put a double sharp or a double flat that but would be the same note. But that's just a way of changing key. It will actually show up though once you've What about the, what do you think a diminished third is going be? A diminished third will be a D. But you've gotta call it E something otherwise it's a second E double flat. isn't it? Yeah. Okay. So if you want it to beco to be a third you've still got to make it an E and call it a double flat. Now you can also have diminished intervals for the fifths and fourths. Fourths and fifths. Alright. So what do you think a diminished fourth will be from C? A diminished fourth would be diminished F double flat which would be played as an E flat. Now will it? Remember there's no minor interval so you can just go Oh yes. straight to an F flat. F flat. Yeah. It'll be, it'll be played as an E but of course it's actually actually an F flat. Okay? As you don't have to go through a minor interval just go one semitone lower and Yeah. it becomes diminished for the fourths. Same thing for a fifth. Yeah. It'd be a G flat. Just an ordinary G flat and that becomes a diminished fifth. Erm and A C to, to A. C to A would be A double flat which would on a keyboard be a G. G. Right. And what about a diminished seventh? Diminished seventh would be played as an A. And it would be called Be B double flat. a B double flat. That's it. Fine. That's, those are the diminished intervals. What about the augmented intervals? Go up a semitone. Right. so an augmented second Second will be? Do you have to go through the minor? No. Because you're getting No. bigger. Oh yeah. So it's going the other way. Right. So that would be a D sharp. A D sharp. a second. And a third will be? It'll be an E sharp. Which will of course just be played as an F. Yeah. Must be called an E sharp. Then we come to the fourth. That's the F sharp. And fifth? G sharp. And the sixth? A sharp. They're much easier this way round because you haven't got to go through the minor at all to reach them. What about a B? That'd be a B sharp. Which of course is played as C. Played as C. So again you wouldn't know you weren't playing an octave. But on paper you can see that you're intending it as a an augmented interval. Then of course you don't have to worry about the octave. You could actually have an augmented first. Which would be the C sharp. Mm. That's a bit silly. It's an interval you'd never see but I mean theoretically you could have that. The augmented intervals are quite easy because you're only going one semitone greater than what, than the note that appears in the major scale aren't you. But to get a diminished interval you've got to remember that if you can have a minor interval, you've got to go one semitone less than that minor interval. Right. Which is two whole semitones less than the major interval Yeah. isn't it? Aha. Except for the fourth and fifth which is easy cos that's just one semitone less. Mm. They're not really so complicated as perhaps they might look in the first place. If you just keep it clearly in your mind that you can have erm major intervals. Anything that appears in the major scale is a major interval or a perfect fourth and fifth. Okay. And then you're gonna have a minor interval from each of the major intervals. A diminished interval from any of the intervals. Yeah. And an augmented from any of the intervals as well. Right. So if you're in the key of F major. What's the key signature of F major? F major, it's a B flat. Nice easy one to start with. So there is the tonic. Let's call it by its proper name, tonic. Tonic. What would a perfect fourth be? Perfect fourth it's erm First of all letter names. It's, it's a C. That's a fifth. Remember you have Oh is it? Yeah. to include the first note. It's er it's er a B flat. So it's B flat. So a perfect fourth is that. Right. I'll I'll put the flat in front of the note so that you can see it. What about an augmented fifth? Augmented fifth would be a C sharp. Right. What about a diminished fifth? Diminished fifth would be a C flat, a B. That's right but don't forget it must be Yeah. called C flat. C flat. So that's a diminished one. Minor seventh? Minor seventh is a B flat. No a erm A. That's a fourth. Oh yeah. Well an A would be a third but B flat would be a fourth. B flat. Now you want a seventh remember. Oh you're going from the other It's erm E flat. E flat that's right. What about an augmented seventh? Augmented is erm E sharp. Which would be played as an F. E sharp. What about a let's have one more, A minor sixth? A minor sixth. That's erm D flat. A D flat. Right you just have to remember that whatever key you're in, you've got to remember the sharps or flats from that key. Cos those will be the major or perfect Yeah. intervals won't they? And then you've got to add or take away. Er if you er if you had to have an augmented fourth what would you do? Augmented fourth. It would put it up a semitone, so it would be a normal B. A normal B. If you had a key signature you would have to remember to make that a natural wouldn't you? Yeah. But if it's got no key signature you wouldn't need to bother to put anything in at all. Cos inevitably it would just be a a diminished fourth. Right. The other part of your homework I've given you to do, is to write down all of the intervals that you can possibly have. But based on the key of G. I gave them all to you based on the key of, of C Now. C. But if you write them all down first of all starting with C. And then going to D which would be the major second. And so on. I've put major second, minor second, diminished second, augmented second. And so on. And then the third and then the third and a fourth and a fifth and so on all the way through. Erm. If you get used to writing those out. And then the next time I'll probably give you some intervals and ask you what they are. I'll actually start writing out things for you to do as homework. And I've also got a book that we can use. I've got grade four and grade five which are quite useful. But I find it more useful actually to write out the things I want you to actually do. Er. And then I shall find out quite quickly what you don't understand. So what we've got to spend more time on. What you do understand so we won't bother to spend as much time on. Cos there are quite a lot of other things as well that we've gotta deal with. In fact we've got to deal with everything that comes in this particular book. And there's quite a lot of it. The other one of the, one of the things that people find very difficult, the learning all the words they expect you to know. The Italian terms. And the French terms now they've added. And some German ones. And there are pages of them. Quite a number of pages. What sort of things? Like erm poco a poco all, all those different speeds. Yes. Erm. Allegro, andante, everything. And they do actually now add, they only used to give you Italian terms, they've now add added quite a lot of the French ones and the German ones. I can never remember the German ones. French ones I don't have any trouble with. Most of the Italian ones I don't have any trouble with. But I can not remember the German ones. But I've never had to use them. You might find those easier. Do you do German at school? Yeah I do. I do French and German. You'll probably find you won't have quite as much trouble as I do with them . But I've never had to worry about them so I, I've never really got on and learnt them. That's, that's what it boils down to. And there are a lot of them. You know they're all things that you, they d expect you to know. And they do ask you questions on quite a lot of them. And there are pages of them to learn. Er. You've got to know quite a lot about rhythm. All the different time signatures that there are, which will include everything Two four three four Two four three four four four Yes. which is the crotchets. Then you've got erm six eight things like that, where it's quavers. Six eight you've got to be careful with because you're in to a different type of time. Erm And you go one one two three four five six. And those are comp what we call compound time. Yes. Erm. It's, it's the same time as three four You have t you have two types of time but you count the quavers rather than the crotchets. It's not quite like that actually. Six eight time is actually two time. But the beats are divided or shared out into three. Oh it's in triplets. Er they're not actually triplets no. Oh. They're, they're, they're six to tell you you have six quavers in a bar. It's true. But they're in two groups of three. Like that. And what it actually means if you see them like that it actually means that there are two beats in a bar and they're dotted beats Oh right. er as opposed to two beats in a bar that are not dotted. Just writ And that's just called two four. That's two time, two dotted beats in a bar. It's called compound time because they're not beats that can be divided into two. They go into three you see. If you have nine eight it's the same thing as saying three beats in a bar. Three beats in a bar. But they're three dotted crotchet beats, or nine quavers in a bar. And they're grouped in threes. The compound time is grouped in threes. The ordinary simple time grouped in twos or the beats can be divided into twos. What's divide actually means in twos is that you share it Mm. equally if you divide something. Erm you can also have six four time. What do you think six four time might mean? Six four. Erm it's Well there are gonna be six somethings Yeah. in the bar. It's Six what? What does the four stand for? It's crotchets. Six crotchets. Right. So. Let's write it down and you can see, six, there are six crotchets in a bar. Now remember if it's got six at the top it means it's in two time. So divide that bar into two and then make each one of those into a dotted beat. And what do you get? Erm You could make a dotted something out of that group of three notes. Mm. Yeah. Erm you have what is it? A dotted now that was a dotted those three notes were a dotted crotchet. Yeah. So three do so three crotchets will become one dotted? Minim. Minim. So six four time means two dotted minim beats in every bar. Right. So it's two time. What about nine eight or nine four? Nine four we'd better do hadn't we? Nine four. It's erm nine, it's nine for crotchets. nine crotchets Or three? Or three dotted minims. Dotted minims in a bar. These are the things people get very confused about. That there are two basic different types of time. Compound time. Simple time. These are the compound ones the six eights, nine eights, six fours, nine fours, twelve. You can have twelve as well. Twelve is four beats in a bar. You can also get it with twos can't you? So you'd have like four two which would be You could, yes you could do. minims. Do you get it with semibreves? No. It's unlikely. No. I suppose theoretically again you could have but it's, it's not a Yeah. not a usual one cos that would make a very Yeah. very long bar and Eight. er but you can definitely have you can have six sixteen if you wanted. Nine sixteen. Six sixteen would be what? Erm it would be Six what Semiquavers. Six semiquavers. In other words two dotted quavers Yeah. in a bar. What would be the equivalent simple time signature to that? The equivalent simple erm Remember six means Yeah. It's two two beats in a bar. So we know the top number's gotta be two. Two. It's two four. Erm Erm no. oh just two quavers in a bar. Two quavers. Which is two? Two eight. Eight. Instead of having two dotted quavers, two ordinary quavers would be eight. It's not a time signature you see very often but again you can, you could have it. Right. Or that one would be three four wouldn't it? And that one would be three two. Three minims in a bar. Three over two. We'll go into those in a lot more detail when, when the time comes. But if you can, if you can understand the difference between simple time and the compound time and er try not to muddle the fact that six eight does not mean that there are six quaver beats in a bar, but it means that there are two dotted beats, and two dotted crotchet beats in a bar and try and get that into your head as soon as you can you're gonna find it a lot easier. So many people find it very very difficult, to sort out the difference between simple times and compound times. If you could basically thr remember to that there are two beats, three beats in a bar, four beats in a bar, five beats in a bar, whatever. But even in compound time you still have two beats in a bar, three beats in a bar, four beats in a bar. But they're dotted beats. As opposed to simple time which is ordinary single beats. Erm you'll hav have plenty of opportunity of writing them down and erm you'll be given a lot of extracts of music like you probably were in that book Mm. and asked to put the time signature in. Of course they get more complicated don't they once you've got compound times, and, as well as simple times. And that one had bar lines, which is the same sort of thing. You've got to know what the time Yeah. signature means haven't you? I just remembered junction thirteen. Fourteen. Right. Oh! I dunno know what to do with this. So you know what you did last year? Nope. I dunno what to do Just stay here. with this. I reckon you should speak to Mr and see where they went. They might cause more trouble than that. Mm. You might be right. Aye. Depends what Actually, we've seen it before but they've got a huge big and it didn't look that big. Mhm. I mean, it's much wider than there. It's like, something like mine, the back end Aye. of the chairs. Er, probably. And it didn't squeak a lot though. Much better isn't it? Well I'd just got it in, and the doorbell went, it was Berty and Joke, Joke had on his uniform and all Mhm. that. Er Joke went to Berty, and he says well you better tell her, you've arranged it all! What's wrong? What is it? He says, well he'll tell you, you know. Well what is it then? And er he says well Berty's arranged for a van to sa to get this suite. So I says when? When? He says, as soon as possible. I said, well how soon's that? And I thought, oh gee! She says half five? Jesus Christ! This is only what, ten to five. God! Doesn't leave me with much time. So er says right, I'll see you later, and just as we'd gone away Joke got back out the car er, and she says don't worry about the money. And I said, I've got it there. And er, she said I didnae worry you and er he turned round and just leave it there, so I think it he's coming to get it Saturday. So that Yeah. settles that. Yeah. It was er Dave 's brother, oh er Andy . Mhm. His brother. It's was about quarter past eight when he comes in. Berty just got here. Mhm. Well if he's done the building then, yeah. Carole's got it. Cos she's got this and exchange it. Aye. Cos she's got a hundred pound That's right. that's why she's swapping. My er, cos I don't Aha. It was actually alright apart from the cushions on the couch. Aye. They were very well that Worn. one's . Cos they're the same, it's, you know, roughly the same. Does she want Yeah. So the I'm talking about having the bloody money to do this, you know. Yeah. So when they brought the seat back it was about quarter quarter to six I think. I think they got all in including the settee I think. Mhm. And I offered them a fiver to pay o for the van but they didn't take it. It was very nice, very . But you have to take it Do you want a cup of coffee. I didn't even eat tea nothing because by the time hoovered and they were away. Mhm. Then they went away about six. And er Kelly saw the ra Neighbours. So I put the dinner on just after Neighbours finished, I thought they'd go. They did eventually go out of the house but he was about done and then he comes in five to seven. last night? Aye, he would be. Oh. Cos he come Aha. straight to bed with a Lemsip. Well, Morris didn't come in last night, but her car was there Mhm. till very, very late. Erm, and I spoke to her in, in Tina's car and she was caught out. Oh. Kelly didn't make them quarter to ten comes in. It was late though. Quite hoarse though. Ste Steven I mean. But he didnae tell me that he, he has telled me in a way. Aye. I just want to know what why Is Ben, is why, why he done that, you know. But he said that Alec denied it, whatever it was. But Margaret told me well it was years ago up at the Germany , says his wife left him. Mm. He went up, and it's first time he'd seen her for a while and she said something about, oh he was supposed to have something but he got to hear this well it's got nothing to do with all the others. Cos Alec said something to me about Maggie. I says, well what? Ah, I don't understand it because Margaret, Alec got on well with Margaret. Maybe they both knew that is, I don't know. See Margaret was going to be, be erm what d'ya call it? Like what I had. Mhm. He was married at the time but he wasnae . Mhm. He had a flat over I think it was. And he came, Alec thought she was a bit abrupt like, but she was alright. Didnae offend, and didnae offend me. Was that, are they ma are they married? Yeah. Aye they, they didn't know. Mhm. But I mean they phoned and that so, he cannae have been Aha. well you probably find it's Well she never got in contact with me again. And meeting her again, she was married. Mhm. He told erm I think it was Berty that tell Alec. Or Berty telled somebody and it Mhm. looks really anyway, eventually. I think they're going to move down south. I think it was Kerry that tell us. Black Kerry? And er Margaret never got her money back from er, for . Ah, but you never found it was Berty's son that co you know what he's like. Exactly. It's, Margaret probably said that. Well that's what Lucy said, that it wouldnae lasted too long, I mean, it was over a year. But er Berty said it would have only lasted a couple of weeks, cos Alec won't talk. But it was Berty getting stuck on the it did go on for so long. Mhm. You probably find he said something to her. Anyway, and I weren't gonna say that to him. He says to her aye, he says, I could tell you a few things about Fiona that'll make your hair curl. I says, I bet you couldn't. He says, I bet you I could. I said, don't talk . And er this was him trying to get off the subject when he was getting a bit nervous I think. Well you better get ready. Go for a bath. You just go like this. This. Oh you mean if you,, I says I was getting that for years Berty. He was really taken aback cos he says to me, you didn't tell anybody, then you Joe. Well kind, what kind did she say? I think she's getting worse! But he thought this is a big surprise then. Especially when he was trying to get off with her. Aye. Aye, that's . It's nice to let us know. Ah. You get us used to it. What are you gonna do, go and tell them? Give him a this afternoon. Er tell him then. Twenty. I'll charge six from silver. Mhm. Six, six, seven Twenty. I saw Steph today. I haven't a, I haven't got a clue what to get her. See . Well not bad, not a bad idea sometimes I know. is it? Better that than buying summat for Well either all I could is, I'll get Tracy summat to wear and you got time, and she picks like a blouse, she'd pay a hundred pound for one. Oh right. She wastes her money all the time on clothes. She has to go to Next, nowhere else. Or Wallis's at a push. I think and I keep thinking well I'm not going in there buying her anything. I was just looking at some of the prices they want for the property. It's ridiculous! Yeah. For a leasehold just the offers over eighty five thousand. Did you read that one? No contact. Right. it off. I've thought it out Simes and now I'm going to apply a bit of thought so it'll keep that on, yeah? And I can stick it back down. No ju just saying that I'm looking for material that would be of interest to the kids Your kids? that would allow them, from a, a graphics point of view that would be of interest, sort of allow them not only to be interested but would, would show them a variety of graphic design based on similar ideas. I was just saying to Simon remember when I did, I did this, before these came out I did the Fab Four Rock and Roll Beatles Mm and there you go, you've got them. What's that? . Let me stick me other bits and pieces I don't think it'll erm there, there! Well it'll repair okay. Goes like that doesn't it? As long as nobody's ripped all the little bits off. Yeah? I don't think anybody has really. No I think it's er I think he'll be anyway you they w he was say it might just have a bit here he was saying, John, that he was so excited mind you, what I want to know is how excited was mum when they arrived? You weren't excited? I just said, goodness, I said we've been waiting for this parcel since before Christmas and he says oh have you duck. Mm I mean he looked at me like I was a bit silly and it was only when I got it and looked he'd got after Christmas written No explanations from the Post Office as to it doesn't actually say on, it doesn't say on it Ah but I think, I was saying I think they've I think they've tested them at customs. Did you think well I, I'm not I think they must have opened it doesn't say on that customs actually have opened them. And it normally has stickers all over it saying Perhaps they just have opened them. Mm. I don't know it was just a thought. So Mind you if customs had opened it it probably would never have got maybe Although he fancied them for their own kids. Yeah but it is, it was ins it was an insured package so Can I see if this'll just Yeah. Right. Just take, just take it carefully. Now this is, you know that you don't Now there's a letter in there that wants filling in for Alex for Alison. We are restoring this. Yeah. Yeah but I filled it, I've botched it up in a couple of places but that's beside the point, it doesn't matter. Dad. Yeah. Yeah? Just need a bit there first. Probably when they see I'm at Keele they'll know I'm stupid anyway. Well, what's that? Why what have you done with the er Nothing. I just put a few things in the wrong place because I didn't read, you know, put them in too soon. It doesn't matter anyway, I mean I put er Well but if you've ju yeah but if you just said, I mean what, you s you did that when Sue was here. Yes I know, that's what I'm saying. You said straight, no but straight , you filled something in then you Yeah I realized straight away yeah. But you said I'm not reading it, well why did you carry on if that was the case? You said to me, the point you said That was it, that was where I went wrong. Oh! Well tha well oh well that's alright, it was only that it'd be I thought you said there was a place for your name and address that hadn't been filled in by the computer so you filled it in? That's right, so I filled it in because that's what you do if you get stuck on Keele you fill in the bits that the computer hasn't Well that seems fair enough fo sort of filled in. Is Alex's alright? We'll have to do something with Alex's cos that thing's still on the front. Yeah well don't So anyway you just want to sign by you, I've put your school and I've put your telephone number Mum and I've put, no you can't my number and Keele and I, I've put nanny's number. Oh Mm. It just needs you to sign it. No tomorrow night there's a P T A at Allyson Street. Oh yeah Well Annette said are you going, and I said well we thought perhaps Why, did they say they they would go if we would go? The, what? Is that is that what you think? Allyson Street P T A I'm talking about, tomorrow. Yeah I know, that's what I'm saying, but did it Well she said I'd sort of thought of going, are you going, I says yeah okay I said, if you won't go I'll, we'll go together, I said but I don't particularly want to get, you know, roped into it at the moment. I don't mind going to show me face. it doesn't ma Yeah You know but just perhaps, perhaps occasional help and then maybe a bit later on get more involved. I don't want to not be in it but I don't want to, you know Have over-involvement. well I, well I've got enough on at the moment. Yeah. What have you done? Anyway then I said are they interested in this quiz night, and she says I haven't go she says she'd ask Jan, I said well give me a ring back a bit later. Anyway sh she phoned me back and she said yes he was, he was dead keen, he wished it'd've just been like pop quiz but he'll go anyway. So it's Thursday the twenty seventh. So I said we'll get out tickets and they'll get their tickets tomorrow, we're gonna get our tickets separately. It says there's sandwiches on and it's at the Oxford Arms so Yeah. Thursday Thursday the twenty seventh. the twenty seventh. It's the day after er F S A. Yeah okay, well I was gonna say And you won't be able to go to the F S A anyway cos you're on your course. Which F S A? Well it's an F S A or a governor's meeting or something up St Margarets. On the, on the notice board? Does it say F S A on a, is on the I can't think, it was something to do with St Margarets, it was either an F S A or a governor's meeting. Thing is you can't go anyway. The governor's thing is coming about quite useful tonight because we've been talking about the law as regards governors and parents' rights and what you're supposed to ask parents Parents' what? Parents' rights, yeah. Not such a thing as parents' rights is there? That the parents are allowed to, to actually opt their children out of certain things. But they can only do that if they're actually away that they, they are aw that they can actually do it. certain things in the first place. If nobody damn well tells them in the first place that they can opt out then they can't opt out can they? There's no point at a later date saying oh by the way you do realize that that show we gave on AIDS Yeah. so in actual fact your child didn't have to go if you didn't want to because Well that's like sex education and stuff isn't it? You can vote no to sex education can't you? Well it comes under sex education. Yeah but there were some people who didn't realize that. I mean I we I would I, you know, personally I think I prefer to do it myself than put th leave it up to them cos mostly they don't know what they're on about anyway. Well this,th this, these are the points we were discussing er that appropriate appropriate Push forward the morals and the philosophy of the Conservative government. Well you wanna read the, you wanna read the paper Like AIDS is a nasty disease that only homosexuals get. Well this is all part and parcel of it because apparently it's now It's to do with moral it'll be a moral thing won't it? it's to er encourage people to do Take a moral view point. to have erm, oh I've forgotten what the terms are now anyway, yes, it was very much a Thatcherite family view This is that new thing isn't it? Oh well it's always protection of the family and yet they're not prepared to put anything to the family. That's what Decent respectable citizens on the lowest budget you can make available. Well that's that's really what this whole thing was about tonight, and that's what we're tackling. No, I think er I think it We've had to d it might be something worth pulling kids out of. Well Cos that's what I tried to say to people, that if you want to be an informed parent then you want to know fully who's doing it, what, you want to know the content, you want And what the qualifications are, you want to know the content and you want to know the delivery Well surely won't we have to have a meeting on that just like,do don't they have a meeting for sex education? They should do but you, er again the reality of it as, as we know Seem to remember our sex education talk wasn't very s specific and didn't cover a very wide area. No. It doesn't cover the important things. I think it was mostly, you know, just meant for females of a certain age, it wasn't really anything to do with anything else. What cos only women get pregnant? No that's it, don't think it was anything to do with p it was all about periods and sanitary protection and stuff like that. Oh well there you go. There you go, it never mentions the condom. doesn't even have anything anything to do with sex does it really ? Well that was our talk. I don't think, mind you we had biology so we didn't need it. No but biology is just purely clinical isn't it? Yeah, well no, well we did, that's what I'm saying I mean they'll do nothing about sex, they'll just do all about morals, won't they, and decent, respectable people I'd say and biology's just cold and clinical. Well no Mum but that's what we were discussing. That's w Int it? we, were discussing, for instance They need to have somebody that's a bit liberal and a bit open and that won't be available under a Conservative government will it? What's what's the aim we've been telling them is the aim, what, I mean somebody came up with the aim, in actual fact, despite whatever else you might be doing, whatever politics were behind it, the aim was to prevent AIDS no matter what you were doing, and not to have any kind of prejudice against what you were doing as long as the aim It's also in support of the nuclear family though int it? One mummy and one daddy bound It was, yeah together for the rest of their lives, and no Yeah. relationships. Well no but that's what this, this talk on is about is er well I forget the paper Have we got a loony left council round here, we have haven't we? No. Anyway,th the guy we had tonight reckoned that er he never quite got to grips with er Bernstein and he's f and he, he apologized for being stuck in restrictive which er he couldn't even remember that it was called restrictive until somebody told him but he said ah yes that's it, but yes I never managed to he said I never managed to really get very far with that. Very er very very nice fella and very, put us very much at ease. Erm good. The first fella is a bit er I, I think is is very academic or has a very ac academic Were there two fellas? Yeah. The first fella was ver no there's, there's some women on the course w er we will see who are actually presenting the course, I mean a good fifty percent of the course is Dad it's ab I think I said to you we've got fifty, a good fifty-fifty split, if maybe not slightly more women actually on the course. Oh on the course,education int it? Erm Well I don't know, it's er Yes Dad Simon? could you take these off ? I can have a go but er like I said to you Have most of them teaching ? Whose bits are these? Alex's. I was using them. Right. So can you no well can you bear that in mind when Alex is sometimes playing with your things? Mm. And bear in mind also that the more you take them off the more you bend them whatever and yeah? You pull them don't you? Well I think that's the intention but as you know it says M in there What? M for Michael Angelo Oh. I assume. Don't know, Now who's phoned? Oh Barbara phoned to see about woodcraft, she said Steve had, or well either her or Steve'd take them. That being , yeah? Anyway Steve picked them up here. I said to her do you think That's mine. there's any chance of picking them up here, said otherwise I'm going to have to her take Alex late. That's Anyway Steve picked them up here and then dropped them off And then who else rang? Rob, Rob Robert Rob or Robert from Quickprint, Robert Oh yeah? Bob. Bob. No Bob, it wasn't Oh Rob from Quickprint? Rob, yeah. Yeah? He said you'd had two more fax, one of them they just wanted a current catalogue Yeah? and he seemed to think the other one wanted to buy something but he,whe whether he couldn't read the writing or he didn't understand it Mm sometimes the faxes are pretty Something about a bootleg. Could you get hold of a bootleg,bu but he didn't seem to know I don't know what else he said about it. I'll have to call in, I'll have to make a Well I sa I said can he contact you later and he says well no not really, I said well I'll tell him to give you a ring in the day some time tomorrow. See I can't do that at all from school, that's Oh. that's the trou no that's the trouble now you see Oh you'll have to just try and call in but so all I can possibly do is after school I s well I wanna get a photocopy of that jacket, so I thought if I, Friday night which I should be home pretty, pretty much on the dot I'll have to pick the, pick these two up and I'll have to just go run down before they close. Yeah? Well you could do, yeah. Well I'll have to really. I'm thinking I finish at three tomorrow but then I'll have to get home, Annette, I said to Annette I'd be there by about four Yeah. but I, I don't know er whether I could do it an hour or not. It's possible I could s if I walk from Newcastle catch a bus to Newcastle then walk from Newcastle. that other one Simes? just take er asleep now but erm could I go and get it? He probably is asleep actually. Oh did he take it upstairs? I think he did take something It's alright I was just getting rid of all these Anyway so it's the P T A tomorrow and I said I'll go Do you want me to go and get them er but we neither of us want to be What time is the P T A? to do anything, half seven tomorrow night. What are we going to do about a babysitter? You're, you're not going only me and Annette are going. Oh sorry, right. Fine. Sorry about that. Right, right No you're getting the other thing on a Thursday the quiz night, twenty seventh. Annette and John are going We're both going Well it's a night out. Sandwiches So it's two pound anyway so if you've got four quid spare between us. Erm I've got a ten pound note I suppose. Did you say there was something on telly you wanted to watch? something really intellectual. five more minutes. Were they, were they very pleased with the parcel? Did they seem Oh yes, they were a bit pleased but straight away they started getting, you know Alex was getting tired so we were getting can I get it out, can I get this out, can I get that and it were half open and I was frightened of losing the bits so I gave him one and he said no he didn't want that one he wanted the other one, so I give him another one and then I nearly gave him a clout. Well what I'll do I'll get, I'll get a bigger box Part of it's erm which I thought actually, I shouldn't really three of them each, you know he was getting silly Yes I know but they are his What he you mean he chose his own? No. He chose his own? No they came Before I even no, no, we chose there were three in a parcel for you and three Cos if he did No there were that wouldn't have been fair. No, Don Don Don Nothing's ever fair for you is it? There were three in the pack No, there were three in a pack for Alex and he opened his bef you opened yours Simon. No. That was it, that was how it came, nothing was touched at all. Don and Debbie sent them as they were. Except Don and Debbie sent three pairs of pants, that game with the punchy springing thing Which broke. and there was a talking And Alex a talking turtle and a book,both got a talking turtle each and it Which one was it? M er Michael Angelo. And it wasn't anything specific, it was just a turtle but thought perhaps Robert might like it. I offered to give it to Daniel actually for his birthday but I, I fe I felt a bit sorry for Robert, I thought o opening all them. He gives you things sometimes doesn't he? And takes things off you sometimes . Yeah. Have you heard what he's done on him today? Tell dad what he done on you. No, tell us what's he done on you today? Well well I was I'll go and get it. I said he'll get . He has actually given Alex one, he give him a ,is it? Cos Simon wasn't Oh one of the pleased about that cos he hasn't got that one. One of the monsters in my pocket? The old ones, the one. This was the cause of it all wasn't it? Go on, tell dad what happened. Tell me what happened then. Well we were on the bus and Which bus? Er to swimming Coming from swimming, going swimming. and no back from swimming Yes? and I had erm hmm I'd swapped Richard something Richard ? No Richard thingy, Richard Richard ? No Yeah and I swapped him this elephant Yeah it's an elephant Yes you know Gnicia Gnicia Yeah, the god. Oh right the In the, the, the In the In I hadn't heard of it at all, don't know what I was gonna say the Indian one, yeah. And I asked Robert if I could have a er have a look at one of these Yeah. one of his in a set and he says Yeah. that I could and he, and he gets Were you keen on the one you looked at? Did you want to see it? Was it really an interesting I only wanted to see this one and he said Is that it? and when he had a look at mine he said no swaps back Ah. we hadn't even swapped. Took one off him and said no swaps back. You see it's all to do with being fair and I shouldn't worry too much. and doing the same But I don't want this one. and doing the Well swap it for another one. I can't, he won't swap me. Well think, swap it with somebody else. Somebody else. I want to swap, nobody else has got that one. Which one? The elephant. Gnish Gnicia Gnicia Well the thing is Simes Swap it for that that's what it's all about isn't it? Okay, if I give him the turtle do you think he'd And that. No way! I'm not giving it away! You don't want that one. You just said. I do, I well if if I swap him that and said here I'll give if I give him the turtle you this turtle as an incentive cos you're giving him the turtle anyway but he won't know that unless his mum's told him. Bet she has though. I'm confused. Are you confused? You will be. Anyway, Simes, the Golden Girls are on, which is full of intellectual stimulation for dads so I'm afraid I'm gonna put the T V on now.

Right Right I'll er, I'll get this er, I'm just busy with, with school at the moment but I'll, I'll get the er whatsit off to you, the er tt erm Beatles Monthly which I've got waiting here and I'll . Nice to talk to you Don say hi to Debbie for us. Okay thanks very much indeed okay, bye . Oh! . Quick. Are you prepared? round the head with this. No we went in and erm it was about er three or four minutes before we actually started and he just gave us this paper and he put sets of questions to the different types of differentiation Yeah and to each set they'd be any thing up to ten sub set questions, so er he says do what you can in er the hour, well it's not an hour, but it's fifty minutes not really no once you get every body in and you get started yeah and, and you look at the clock at five too, five too and that's it and you think you might of done and you're still stopping so we set off going and I thought well the first ones were, didn't ask for a proof of doing it, just asked to do it to do it, yeah so I started working through them, but without referring back to the notes that you know what some of them yeah, yeah differentiated to mm, mm so you really have to remember what some of them change into yeah yeah, like some of them you can, you like it ain't it? you can work out the mathematical ones mm but the trigonometry ones you have to know what they turn into I got some things, a couple of them I was getting stuck on what I supposed to put and then I actually go too far on some 'em, I, I make them again you know yeah, yeah any way he's coming round you've not much proof you can prove them yeah huh, summat like that well you can get so far, but then I work the brackets out and you don't always have to work the brackets out mm you leave them as a full themselves, yeah erm set of numbers, erm any way he was coming round and I just kept saying well I'm stuck a minute, he says why, I says it doesn't look right he says well why doesn't it look right?, he said well why doesn't it look right?, I said look if I say it doesn't look right that's all I know, it just doesn't look right you daren't say that you don't understand any thing he says you've got to explain no I'd done it why you don't under yeah and you don't always know but I'd done it you see mm but the answer didn't look right look right, yeah to the question so you couldn't well he's going through it and he said well it looks alright to me and I say well it doesn't look as if it's connected, any way I won, I could see why then it didn't look connected mm erm, with because it was, erm as the denominator and not an numerator one it was, it was one over but it was alright? so it was right any way subsequent to that he gave us one which it was awkward working it out and then he gave us one over the same yeah I said I'm not working all that out again no just I just go over and do it all again do ya and then do a different rule yeah, yeah so he said yeah but there's another way you do it, I said well what's the point in doing it again, I've just done it one, he said well yes there's two ways of doing it he wants to see you doing it the other way as well no he didn't no no oh any way I got to the last one and it was two combinations combined together, so you've got two separate combinations to do and then you're to put those two together in with a different rule do you know how I feel now, I said if she ain't saying yeah I'm gonna what you told me yeah you know what he said the first time we went into sociology I mean I feel a bit like you must of felt then well I came out and I actually just finished them mm I just did the last one, the next, the, the, the next to the last one erm, I said er, I can't remember what the differentiation of it is, he said you wouldn't you haven't done it, I said no we'd started to yeah I said I know it's an inverse, well he said if you know it's an inverse you're half way there yeah so he said well what's an inverse and an inverse?, I said it's back to the original back to what it is then, yeah he said that's all you need to know so he actually showed me how to work it back yeah but I said look it's Wednesday lunch time, I haven't woke up yet, I don't wake up to Friday night you know I'm still struggling and we were having a laugh, but the others who had him last term, said he was brilliant, because he actually combines work individually individually, yeah rather than works just going through it and hoping you all keep up mm and we were saying last year we could of done with having him for a bit so er how's Jean coping with this alright? she was getting through them, they were just slower mm, mm but she was getting there, her and Bren were er conferring you see I'd sort of gone through what I'd done and every now and again she'd say well I've done this and I'd say well it's right. Are her and Bren still in the, more or less the same boat, they kind of just, mustering through as it were? I think Jean's got more about her than Bren than Bren yes sort of, but neither of them are taking it on are they next year? yeah, well Bren is yeah, I don't think, is Jean, I got the impression like she wasn't, I don't know I think originally she'd done Russian studies and management or something originally she was going to do it, but there's a new one come in and she's decided to go on this management, managements and it's the new one that's right yeah it doesn't start till next year does it? mm, till the, the trial yeah it's a lot ain't they? somebody else I know er somebody else's applied for it as well Dan's going for it he thinks yeah he, he isn't, he's a bit, up in the air I think at the moment, he doesn't know what he wants to do I don't think I mean I keep on saying if I found I couldn't do the maths I'd ditched I wouldn't go on but if, if if you could, the first year but I think , I think if I did flunk out on the maths side mm I would look probably for another course he did strike me like how I'd feel about this because it's I mean it's, yes it's difficult, but yes I've got to do it and if I don't do it this, you'll have to do it again, so I thought well he took to me I'm the one that's going to get me through, not them I mean fortunately doing the maths it's the sort of thing you notice when you complain you might as well do yeah doing, doing the maths you see I don't have to do another science next year that's right, yeah cos it's already there yeah I don't know what, do you have any thing that you have to put in place if you don't do I know what you mean, you mean if you take maths under principle you're gonna have subsidized principle maths well you, you've only got to get to subsid science mm, mm that gives you subsid science yeah, so why would you have to do another one next year? you won't have to do another science next year will you? you've got to do another subsid maybe so, I don't know, I thought you only needed two subsids, unless a subsid in summat you take to doesn't count, but that that would never be what, what you see I've got two subsids now literally the transfer I don't really now and the subsid, sociology yes I work, er unless they say next year just you transfer most wasn't it? well yes cos to transfer you the only thing I wondered is if next year that you've got to do a subsidiary, and if you've not got a science you must do science not against another subsid I must admit no so specializing in that, you know, rather well the thing is in the end for all the subsidiaries that you pass it counts on the mm final award I mean I, this year if I get me physics and me, and me I wouldn't mind doing another one next year, but my choice, whatever I fancy at that time mm you know, like the biology I you know the biology's gonna be hard, I can tell that the maths gonna be hard, but I think I've got more of an interest in biology than physics, I mean I, I don't know if Jean's done any any biology I don't know you know I mean I've looked through the parasitology books I've got about two of 'em it's all cestodes and lima luminaries and and worse the jargon in biology it's, in biology what got me, when I did it, it's, it's, yeah the Latin names and most of the time the dictionary words that you have to remember mm, I mean I'm okay cos I've done my yeah although I haven't done particulary parasitology I know some of 'em, I've done bits of 'em, but like if you've never done biology it must be the same feeling again mm that you had in sociology that I yeah still get in the physics yeah you know you just still bewildered because you don't understand, I mean like I go to this night class and apparently I, I learn from it, but in actual fact I don't, I come out I get eight out of ten, nine out of ten, or ten out of ten and I haven't got a clue what it's about no and that, that to me is just a waste of time, no I mean I'm wasting their time and mine so yeah I'll have to get down to it I don't I don't know that I'd fancy doing, I mean I did like biology, but I don't think I'd specifically want to do the biology at the level that they're doing it up there, cos it's too much of a jump from what I've ever done before yes I think any thing at that level must be, you know, when you think well sociology yeah, nice, interesting, sociology at university level no it isn't though because it's again a tendency to be based on what you can read and what you understand of today's social problems, I mean every thing we've had so far apart from the industrial revolution and the history behind it mm is being about today sociological problems yes yeah I mean like we've had er woman not too bad woman and children of the third world, well that's of today's problem, what about they show you how it was created, it's a problem of today yeah, yeah, yeah we had this day state ethnicity and racism, it was all about gypsies state technicity? state, it's three separate groups, state ethnicity and nationalism oh right yeah and they did it on gypsies did you, oh they, there and gypsies probably I don't know mm that didn't crop up, what was they cropping up was erm that they've got a very definite code of what is internal to them and what is external to them, it starts off what belongs in the camp and what belongs out of the camp mm and outsiders you are not gypsies don't belong in the camp so the feeling of the gypsies to what to us is probably equally antagonistic as most people's attitude to gypsies then it's what belongs in the trailer as to what belongs out I felt sorry for the gypsies you know in Cross Street not Cross Street, they were on the festivals car park, you know the whole thing and I mean then he kicked them off didn't he, so they moved up to Cross Street so in a way it's their own fault, they could of let them stay there, I mean every body wants to be settled somewhere like Christmas as well don't they I suppose mm I felt sorry for 'em but, they, the way the way they were, they got the, actually the the woman, she's a girl, she's a doctor of sociology she's, she's barely out of her twenties she's not who? Sharon mm absolutely brilliant lecturer she really was , she, she's on the antipology's staff seems to me though at that age you've got freshness and initiative yeah you know what I mean they haven't gone stagnate yeah and stale and bored with the job she still got the real interest there gave a lecture and all she came in with was some notes written out on some full scape paper and some papers for the over head projector mm but she just bowled over I think enthusiasm does go over and doesn't it? the hour had gone and we could of stayed probably another half an hour without realizing that the hour had come yeah and gone and then we went to the tutorial and I'm afraid Harry just, phew, it's just like wind up session, you know you feel as if you want to cut, to get it going mm but erm he was on about certain aspects that he picked up from her, but having been in gypsy caravans round here, as when they were on Line Brook you see we were always at Line Brook for one reason or another mm and they do have different standards, but I say they are different classes of the gy yeah, yeah the true gypsies are clean, it's the, what we call the tinkers, just the travellers that pop on a site and move on yeah yeah do a quick kill on the tarmac and see what goes on in the town and then they move on redefine rubbish and move on yeah but there used to be a caravan down here, I'm not joking the value of stuff that was in it, was unbelievable and it was so clean and every thing had a place and it was all mirrored inside, cos he liked the mirrors and, or glass work, oh it was beautiful yeah stuck in the middle of that dumpy site mm but the site was they did their own down fall with the first ones that went on it, cos they ripped out all the water pipes and the toilets and the, they, they literally decimated the site so the Council said oh they're not doing it again any more, yeah me sister was saying that this, cos she lives opposite the thousand of pounds er yeah so of course they're against it they threw it all in the brook mm so they refused to do it up, well the result was over the years the pot holes down to the sites got bigger and they're so far off the road from mm Brook Lane, but well what you couldn't see you didn't know about, we used to take the cars down there it was nightmare and when you got down there, there was always the dogs roaming around and mm but there was some nice people yeah but there was some rough ones yeah, I thought it's worth but I mean when you start looking at what the topics are in sociology, there's nothing really tha that you haven't got some if you've got a ma if you've got a mature mind and another thing, yeah I would think for some of the younger ones who haven't seen or read a lot in the papers of where, what's going on we said that last year to our Neville and found it very boring it might be very difficult and it could be mm, mm boring , but when you've got that experience of, you've seen these things occur well when they start talking about how hard done two women are yeah and how easy men have it, you know what I mean, a little bit of you saying oh yeah, yeah, yeah that happened to me I know it could well I mean we had one girl didn't know what she was going about, but, you know, women don't have all the work to do in the house and her dad helps at weekends and I said well who made the decision in the first place to do what after the weekend well we help with the dinner, but I said who was it that decided what you're having and got the ingredients together and had decided and the fact you're going to help her with the dinner, huh and she kept on about, but we help, I said but who do you help? she can't identify though with a woman that's kind of been mild and had kids and, er well I did say er are you married?, no, will you be having any children?, definitely not, I said well unless you're prepared to take on the responsibility mm of a home and a family that a woman has with children, you've got no right to criticise no, no oh we had quite a heated argument about it you can only learn I think from your, from your experience and yet it's something every body has to go through personal experience, yeah isn't it that? that yeah breaking away and realizing just how, you know how mucky a house is so it is so easy when you're only helping on a side line because you're not doing any of the thought processing you probably think you put a lot into, yeah, it's the remind as well I think like the constant remind of you were the one that takes responsibility for birthdays and for Christmas presents yeah and for writing letters and yeah you know maybe helping neighbours and yeah like things I suppose men don't think of I sat there and not because they can't yeah but because they've never been taught, you know taught to do that sort of thing I sat there last night I actually I'm on the way to the post office cos I got the erm form back for claiming for Christmas holidays mm and they're asking erm for a copy of the grant again again which they've had haven't they?, for how many weeks in the year do you actually attend cos I said that you don't get grant for the holidays and it stipulates the term you don't get it for Easter you don't get it you get so much for Easter, don't you, but none for the summer, they give you twenty odd quid for Easter and twenty odd quid for Christmas well with the dependents allowance you get so much with it yeah , yeah but apparently you see the terms are split up and you actually don't get any thing when you're not in on mm the terms, well the grant form shows what the terms are mm so I said well it cost us just so many weeks though, I've put it in again, I've, I'm sending it back today in the hope that they will come up with a decision in the next week, cos usually once they've got the information they'll write back say within ten days yes or no mm but erm I'm thinking about this thing, new what sort of representative sample, where they get the whole thing random, I think they just go and knock at doors, take out every so many names off the list must be of so many men and so many women, of today er I think er a class difference I think she's got a quota mm, mm so many of each type or yeah each age, age group or whatever give a fair representation yeah yeah mm oh well this P C F A er Trish maybe us er the, the woman who I meet up at you know who works in the coffee shop she was there oh yeah she was there she's oh they've got some stuff there blimey she said meeting you here, well she sat chatting to Emma all night I haven't seen her for ages they were laughing and giggling up the corner and er, I mean I did go just to let them know that although I did say I wouldn't come to every meeting I was quite prepared to still do mm, mm what I could did Joe come with you oh he would because he didn't wanna stay in or he wants, cos he wants to go every where I go to see what you're doing, what you're up to to see what's going on yeah and I said well your be bored, no I won't, and about half past eight, which I thought well we should be finishing by now, he said well aren't we going? I said well we will be going and it finally finished at nine o'clock, erm, the the topics under discussion are all really relevant mm, mm but they sort of get carried away slightly yeah you all follow and chit chat gets going some where else yeah and then you go in with that conversation instead of the one you should of yeah yeah but er, they've got to get a new mini bus apparently, there in two years, which we new and er because like every thing else, it's funded by the school not the authorities mm, mm but well have they got to get rid of staff or not?, cos the school that Gary's at now they had like an emergency meeting on Monday mm it was supposed to be a normal meeting but he changed it to talk about the cuts you know the on saving education, he said that I supposed to get the six teachers, he said I'm gonna get rid of five he said and if I possible can I'm going to make it four, that gotta remember those of you who are on protected salaries erm you again the pay and a half other members of staff and he said he wanted voluntary redundancies and early retirements where possible, you know, and also he hadn't supposed to tell for a month so this will come out later in the year and he says I'm telling you know he says because the next twenty eight days, it's an extra twenty eight days to go and have a look for another job yeah if you want to, but Gary's pretty sure that he won't be one of 'em he hopes but then well that's the problem if nobody thing is though if it did happen yeah at least were, were covered yeah you know, but I mean at the moment I keep, he's coming home some nights and, you know it like, he'll come home and say I had a really good morning the kids were great, but as for the afternoon, and like he said when you're teaching you're only as good as your last lesson, you know yeah so I thought he, he's changing things he's saying well I don't think this is suitable and I don't think my way of tackling this is suitable because he's used to dealing with different kids, although they're a similar age, they're not very motivated or mighty but they're more motivated than these kids, but he says like he'll turned back towards the black board and he'll be writing and they're shouting abuse at him, F ing and blinding and he says it makes me so angry because I don't know the voices well enough to know who's saying it mm you know, it is just so frustrating, you know and er some of these kids he said and the language they use, one girl came in, she hadn't been in for three or four days, he hadn't met her and he said hello you must be such and such er fuck you you know, I mean, he'd never even met the girl before, he said it's very you know distressful and demoralizing mm but he seems to be mustering through any way no telling cos cos he's got to really more than you can tell him to watch To Sir With Love oh dear and then oh it, er, yeah because he had exactly the same problems when he moved in yeah and he's attitude was in the end well if you don't want the education as it comes, we'll teach you the education that you want and the first thing was well was to respect each other and that yeah was my essay, I wrote in to the education was that, the top and bottom of personal discipline mm, mm was the self respect for you and a respect for others mm and the discipline is only there out of respect hanging out the window shouting abuse at one another coming up the corridors yeah, yeah don't but the thing is I was reading this erm, I was reading another book on this erm you haven't read another book Sandra, that's two books, goodness I've not got through them all, I was just reading selective pieces bits, yeah the trouble with this is it's an American book so it's a bit, I call it biased, erm on erm the betrayal of children on, on the way that they're not in childhood for very long and it blames literacy, that the more the literate the child becomes mm the earlier the literacy developed will become a the sooner they become independent mm and this idea of childhood being up until sixteen, eighteen years of age, was only shows at nine now aren't they yeah you know shows at would develop only after the sixteen century mm, mm, yes, yeah in the middle ages yeah children were grown up when they were eight and nine because they were working that's right, cos of the more responsible than they are now it's only changed with the, the revolutions that said that mm children were not allowed to be employed for different lengths of times and social change mm expensive to do Yes you just write over the top, sort of write over the top of it and it raises off That's right, mm But I, I mean, erm I suppose it's best to do it in colour We've got some of the stuff downstairs colour along Yeah I suppose it'll cost yeah Cost more in printing cost more doesn't it? Yeah Yeah an awful lot more Yeah, yeah so if I mean it is a quite complex problem because once you've Once you have a single colour it's okay Yeah Yeah a single colour, ah, right, yes, well that maybe quite nice Because you want something which is big and small Mhm so that you know you can use it, you know, on your own, publicity material Yes something that'll look good blown up aha Yes, yes to do a poster or something yes, that's That doesn't immediately occur to me that it's for blind people No No That's what I thought it's like for like, for, for like hearing, a hearing aid person Mm that's my initial thought it's not obvious Oh we definitely don't want that cos all the money will go the money will go to sign language in Devon Can I, can I have a What you see are the headphones so you think about hearing Hearing you don't think about sight That's right, yes and I think that's, that's quite, quite right Yes I mean just, I mean this is, you know Mhm this is the quick we did for this, and that's Yeah why we just put the eyes on the front Mhm what we don't want is a man with a white stick job No, no I mean that's no, no and we don't, we don't want a green dog either no And a dog oh no watch Graham I think that yes A bit His Master's Voice isn't it? Yes Oh no, a guide dog listening His Master's Voice in Hamlet, you know, it's just, stick a who I am on that wee dog, I can remember I can see, I can remember that from But the, the dog listening to a big ear instead of a, an earphone If guide dogs can sue us Aye guide dogs, I know. Now er moving on erm I did phone Marcus up and asked why were the coming to London and it is something to do with television Yes he gave me a number to phone and I've tried phoning and I've not had a response, but I'll keep trying This is a that's very difficult to get hold of Yeah I haven't managed to get all of them Yes, mhm Sixteenth of September, no The nineteenth Nineteenth round about then, mhm Right, cos it only dawned on me cos the first of September erm the Wakefield meeting that was talked about Right on the nineteenth of August was postponed and it's now in a couple of weeks, so I'm gonna go Is it now? Right in a couple of weeks, whenever it is Right Same one I was going to go down to Was that, what was it on?

I don't know I don't think there's an airport in Stone Haven No Oh You're flying into what? She's actually flying to Di's Just drop you off in I'm not coming You can see it all folks That's for the thirtieth you're flying into Dave's? Aha Well I'll be in Aberdeen Anyway Oh and that's Aberdeen airport I could maybe pick you up Yes, let's try and I'm not quite sure I've put my name down cos I live in Aberdeen, my home's Aberdeen, so I'll be in Aberdeen for that with the thing with the fancy Excellent I'll get together with that quite right, I can easily be at Dave's Saturday, no problem, I know Dave That's a Saturday is it? That's a Saturday Yes What's the I don't know I know I quite like to go, but erm Well I'll be in I was telling you I'd loved to have gone you know Commodore cos that's where Tom's going commercial in Russell Square, next door Aye next door Oh that Yeah all the theatres and the country There is the, there's the I find that quite useful The erm Scottish Theatre Guide Yes the Scottish Theatre Guide I haven't seen one of them for a long time I'm staying in Aberdeen Of course That was Scottish, Federation Scottish There's a theatre marketing which is closing it, well, sort of shutting up shop at the end of the month, maybe So do I, what I like about going home is you can get away I haven't seen that for a long time So we're back this isn't a Federation That's right Marketing Committee that's right, but if you're actually going home it's easy Cos I seem to remember having so something a long time ago, especially the smaller theatres as well as a touring thing, you know, it'll be handy for you Yeah Mm you know what was going to be where Yeah I think though, I mean it comes back to sort of wanting to know, we're just talking again about what's on Mm Mhm we need to know before it's published That's right you know you need to know like six months before I, I won't give up And if everybody does all sorts of for finding that out, whether you go through the Arts Council Yeah you see the Arts Council has a finger in most pies, the only way to find out through them, I mean the trouble is, a lot of it, is going to be confidential Mm Yes erm But then if you did it at the stage before, before it gets into the Scottish Theatre Guide you can then make your dates available or you can agree your dates and you can get publicity and that at home. Yes, cos that's the thing That's the thing aha Publicity is the thing So we need to find Aha But if, if you can find out through Lucy whether or not Mm that publication is still on the go, because if it is gonna carry on, on the go, we can maybe get into the Yeah editorial of, of the gathering of the information Mhm Yes That would be Yeah, right erm cos the publicity is not just for visually impaired people or even for sponsors, it's for theatres too when they're seeing this and saying ooh, I noticed they're doing that, this, this and this Mm and we're not doing it Yes you see and that would be Yes that's right that'll be an idea wouldn't it? Talking about publications , one of the things from the last meeting is Iris pointed out the number of theatres in here say they do audio description and I've, I've yeah Oh I, I said that to you at the time Robert, I mean I'll be honest and I saw that document and I nearly died and it's the way they say it too I don't suppose you know I've been, I've been through them all and er there's only one or two that I've not actually had any contact with actually one way or another. Some of them are people that erm that I've generally had contact with, in terms of starting to talk to people about it erm, other people are being kind of, what's the word, optimistic, with the truth Likes And The Brides for example , erm Well we have done it We've done it since they lied about what happens It's like it's like the Arkley one, I want to know, you know and the small and the one Down In The Borders The one that's Down In The Borders yes, I mean that, I've seen so , another piece of print about that one Down In The Borders and erm it's, it's not our version of audio description, so I am going to write and linked to that I was going to do a new information sheet, I found the old information sheet so I just bring that up to date Mhm I do, I like, do you think I could have a copy of anything you've got to date because lying in my desk this morning is something I have to prepare a briefing note for my chairman and I was thinking about that recent one, but I couldn't put my hand on it Robert, absolutely updated on exactly where we are. I don't think I've got one here, but I could send you one. Could, could you, thanks, thanks Robert, could you fax it? Yeah Cos he wants it like Yesterday What does he want it for? Oh, well, because this video has come in Of course it's gone, it's gone to chief execs Oh I see so they want in the Regional Council and they now want to know all about them see the back ground, yeah so that's good, because it might mean money, it means of having and that's for Counsellor ? Well no it's the convener, the convener of the whole region Oh right like you know Yeah, whatever it is No, ah, more senior than him, it'll go to him too, but it'll be for everybody's So what you want then is the sheet we did a few weeks ago just about the erm Yeah, give me the update, yes and if you're just updating that a bit, if you're gonna update it then, aha Right, okay yeah Cos it'd be nice to show it's happening here, here, here and there, you know. Yeah I'm not sure if it mentions the magic words Regional Council, but Well you'll have to get that fitted in somehow I'll, I'll fit it if, if, if not you can re-type it if you can gonna get It's on the computer though, I think we can manage Oh dear So erm, Advisory Committee being the next item, well we will, we'll have a word from Brian we'll, I haven't approached er David yet in Glasgow meeting, but I will do Mhm and obviously Ingy will let us know when she can come and we can talk a little more about the Festival. Erm, I've been thinking that I can't chair this meeting and take the notes and things when it becomes, and if it, the fund comes through and it becomes the audio description project as opposed to this group, and you know we will be widening out a little bit, I wonder if we should actually have a chairman type person. I haven't spoken to erm, I mean I only thought this coming along in the street, whether there's anybody sort of notable, I mean is it, is, is, is there any value in actually having a figurehead type chairman you know, sort of celebrity type Yes I think it makes a big difference type person who you can Oh yeah somebody could push forward to Mhm you know snip ribbons and things I dunno, I'm not suggesting will you find out now, but there's something yes, interesting angle If there's anybody that comes to mind. I thought about Tom on more than one occasion because Tom for so many years was the voice of the royal wedding and erm this and that state affairs and things, state occasions and he only lives in Murrayfield, I mean A state of affairs is not appropriate at the moment mind you I heard that They were, they were videoing for this thing and you know, they were over and some of them were doing something and it is somebody you normally and the news and I said the news and actually sort of frozen and the guy said to me, he must of actually seen me frozen there, he said it's okay, it's okay, it's nothing about whatever her name is, you know I said oh no, no, he said I've to go to Brussels you know and it'll be all about, oh I thought I was really dreading it I, I don't know, I, I think it'll be lovely if you can get up a blind person Mm Yes Mm blind actress, a well known blind is it that? Was a blind actor he's, dead now I think Oh is she dead? We don't want He is Oh we don't no she wouldn't she's away, yes, she was away Anyway that's what's involved Anyway it's a thought Yes it's a new thought, mhm Yes I mean there's, there's the practical side of actually having, I mean well there's various aspects of it you could have someone as a figurehead Mhm who never actually did anything apart from this, sort of push forward to receive cheques from The only thing is to make sure that somebody's going to come along, because the worst possible scenario is like or you could have, or you have the Society for the Blind in Glasgow who the lord lady profe Oh who never turns up for anything professed person and they, she, she never turned up at anything Not even the opening? She never ever turned up at anything Never, so I mean you might as well not bother you know Mhm or whether you actually have In fact it makes you more stupid Mm you know working type chairman or something, I don't know, anyway it's just for you to think about it Yes, that's it Right, any other business Iris look forward to the Playback send you about seven hundred pounds Mhm and so Jane can now report the, now that's been settled Yes, thank you, thank you That's really good Erm but er I thought I was a yesterday, erm Aha something although they were quite, er nothing, nothing to do with er Aha and to pop down to do theatre because I see Paula eat before at Perth Aha and he assured me it is an Who's this? ideal little spot to do it audio description from The commentary booth, yeah Yeah because when Marcus and I went we didn't actually see up there, but we could see from down there and Yes, yes that's yeah aha I think we'll be okay on that Mhm Paul of course is leaving Oh Is he? Ah to go and do something in Dundee, so they've advertised his job Oh Oh well we were talking about funding, I've actually got an account for expenses Oh right so that's what the money is about and that's where the money came from Mhm Aha I've got I, we're, we're going to get some money from the Ingy fund for the Festival Mm Yes plus, erm, plus the expenses from us going from Glasgow, I don't know whether anybody from Edinburgh will have expenses, but erm, what shall, where, where shall I ask her to send this cheque for it, I mean I still, there's still an account open for it in Glasgow for audio description Aha Right but I mean who was, Linda would, would be treasurer Yeah has she got an account there? Yes It'll probably be better just to get and then she'll the money for the Yes that's right so I'll get them to send it off to Linda if we, all the information for Linda comes through me anyway Yes, right, okay, fine because the address she's put it on is the society's address Oh is it? Yes Right which she felt was better than her home address Aha Oh yes aha right and I've got the bank book Fine so the money is I see I'll get the cheque made payable to and Hope you're administering this Robert and then Robert knows The only question is whether or not Jane has a key to open the drawer in the I know I couldn't get the, I couldn't find the key for the desk, no That was her story, alright Oh I've forgot to say under advisory committee, I, this has taken so long, I've completely forgot about it. We do when we set up this group we asked for a representative Ah, yes aha and eventually after some searching they nominated someone who then resigned from her post not Clare Clearly because they nominated for Right in Stirling, central region, erm changed her job or something so that she no longer her, her voice Mhm on disability issues and they haven't been able to find anybody else, but what they've said,despite extensive attempts the convention has not been able to obtain a replacement for this one, due to and buys us time. I'm disappointed that we cannot be represented, but sure you will appreciate position. Please continue to send papers for any relevant meetings and an attempt will be made to respond to appropriate issues, if there is any specific topic you wish to be considered, please do not hesitate to get in touch so I thought that was quite a nice letter seeing as I practically read them all I would also like a copy of that Mhm because if I enclosed a copy of that with this response to chief execs Mhm that'll kind of filter its way through into and will cause will certain need some Yes I'm not quite sure of how and they won't like that one little bit, they'll amend them because they've done it Yeah, I mean it's been going on for ages I don't think that's erm particularly fair right, I mean I'm not quite sure how Coslow will go about things, I mean the reason we wanted someone from Coslow is cos we wanted someone from the Federation of Scottish Theatre cos we hadn't heard for a while Yes we had Roy and then we had Simon for a bit and then we decided because it wasn't working altogether an Edinburgh person and a Glasgow person Mhm erm Well I think it's very important Robert because, I mean as the charter for the arts indicated look at the money that local authorities are spending upstairs to us and really you know we, we are Well exactly, I mean we have, we sort of, we, we kind of anticipated that Oh yes, so I mean come on let's, let's give them another wee push, gently so , I mean we've erm, I mean I've developed a relationship with David at Coslow Yes that's right so it might be that he could come, erm, anyway I'll give you a copy of that Yes, so that I can just sort of say, you know, we did invite and, that might help Where are we on I mean I'm not quite sure how Coslow , how do Coslow sort of nominate their representatives like that? We asked them to put some I've no idea, I mean, did they sort of send someone like you who's who is an employee Well for, for example Phil is our, yeah Phil seems to, to go to some of these meetings and, but mainly it's the elected members Yeah Mhm and it's usually elected in Well Glen isn't in fact an elected member Ah, right, well, I mean she should be able to give us somebody, God there's, there's ten million of them I would of thought so that's right And it helps you Cos I was looking at with funding, you know, it does help What about Jimmy ? because then they go back Jimmy ? Yeah Councillor you know people like that Yeah anyway Yes that would be where are we with costing and theatres on the nominal charge? What are we doing about that? Er, I haven't contacted the Citizens in due course, but erm Yeah that was a you have contacted the Lyceum Have I contacted the Lyceum? Oh good we're charging the Lyceum Yes Erm because we agreed to it What was it we said? Twenty pounds I was gonna What I just want to I was gonna say fifteen To you fifteen Everybody say a different figure now I, I have talked Are we to invoice Brampton Theatre asked me how much it was going to cost, so I, off the top of my head I said twenty pounds Mm erm thinking that we ought to charge something because to hire the equipment is very expensive Sure and if we were looking at running costs and replacing things and and all the rest of it that's what I'd say, yes, yes of course to be, to be replacing that, so I said twenty pounds off the top of my head, so Brampton Theatre have agreed to that as well Right and they will will they pay that as a one er Yeah, mhm they'll pay Pay each time Yeah, yeah Will you require Is that either side each time or is that up until Christmas? Right, presumably if there was a necessity, would there be a necessity to produce an invoice? I mean what would your system Mm, yes require an invoice for that kind of thing? Yeah Oh yes Well what we might have to do is concoct something up on a letter, a stand have you a standard charge? but it doesn't matter whether it was, you don't have to do one You'd do it all You could do in advance or you could do retrospectively or Do it as that or you can do it after three months, yes I mean We could do it up till Christmas, three monthly or something like that Yeah Mind, we wouldn't want it every time Yes, mm So we need to some time Too much paper work apart from anything else Yes, that's right it's a pest That's good that's good Yeah it just gets a wee bit much Mm, well it, it keeps you being able to run it so you're Mm not stuck Yes and That's a hundred and eighty pounds worth there Yeah It's too It's too expensive over, over the holiday season That's right That's another one for Christmas then double It's certainly cheaper than the way you were doing it It's certainly cheaper than three hundred and fifty quid, they showed up that's it exactly and that's crazy Right I don't think I've got any other things You could of bought your own equipment Yeah by now Yes you could of it's a shame Erm, oh I have got something else, which is music, erm, at the last meeting I said I've been talking to Simon from the Queen's Hall, about the idea of doing pre-concert notes Mhm Right not, not actually doing an audio description of the conductor and again, and again Worried about doing ballet One thing, one thing about it, it's crossed my mind a long time ago is er the idea of erm in the half hour or whatever twenty minutes before a concert, doing er concert programme notes Yeah particularly if there's you know heavy Mm information about a particular piece, so, Simon and I sort of, we were talking kind of fairly casually about that, but erm, what we agreed to do is, this was about the time when we first got the equipment I think and it, it occurred to me that you, and I've checked this now, that you can actually plug a cassette, you know, a Walkman type of player into either the microphone for the Right radio system or Aha indeed into the infra red if you were using the, I mean obviously that's a small scale, probably wouldn't, erm, so the idea of actually putting some concert notes onto a tape or indeed doing it live, so anyway Simon is away on holiday, after the Festival but I've arranged Cannon principal and for him and you Right and his most regular blind patron who you know Mrs Mhm to Ann mhm to kind of just get together with someone he's identified a person whose name I can't remember but he's got a chamber orchestra Right what I was interested in knowing in was for example whether he's got his chamber orchestra repeated their same concert five or six times in different cities Mm I just, it's just a sort of an idea at this stage, I'm not wanting to take up ogres of time on this, but I'm quite weary of doing it with a, with a full set and everything it's, it's, it's, awfully tiring for taking the system Yeah down and, and may well be just one person requiring and you've got somebody else to go down Yeah, well there may be other mechanisms of doing it with it and hand it out week and then at the concert collect it at the end again Yeah it's a kind of thing that I think could be put and take and people could pick up at the box office Yeah I think so Yeah, well maybe that's what we, we You could pick it up beforehand at the box office Well maybe that's what you do, yeah Er, yes Erm, you know, maybe it's something we can do in just a one off during the winter Mhm you know if the SEL are doing concerts on the basis of six or seven of the same, I'm, I, I really don't know enough about it Mhm and it maybe something that we can get one person to come into Playback Yeah make up a, a note and then you How did the home of the brave do their thing? That was to do with head sets? Eh, to do with head sets yes Aha, nothing to do with And that was picked up Our infra reds there They're infra red, yeah That's picked up right then So, so there is something I mean Margaret, have you been to it Cath? No Margaret was at it really she said really it was not much for blind people No and I've No it's not I've spoke to Colin to just to try and cope with it And the crowds and the aha Yes, aha very difficult for blind people Mhm No we were not There was lots of consulted or asked or involved or anything like that there's lots of things you could touch Yes though, yes which is good which is good, makes a change, aha So that's the only other sort of bit of sort of The other thing is I mean, erm, the, the Trone did it a couple of years ago, they haven't done it this year they Er, no, yes recorded they got, somebody recorded that's right the, the entire winter programme the next three months of programme on tape, several plays there were Not that you did, erm and I think there was a bit of a up the place Aha and they had they, we copied them That's right and we had half a dozen of them at the box office and if anyone, I think we still sent them out if anyone wanted them Yes but it meant people could go up to the box office and take a tape recorder and sit and listen to them Right I think they had to take the Oh we did that as well, you had the Morag does it, Morag does it for them anyway Yes, so it's quite good to have that kind of thing to publicize. Yes it would be good to get the Trone to do that again, we must have again Yes cos that stopped Yes I mean he was doing that before we ever started audio description and now They've been doing it for some time at the Biro, Perth is Oh yes does, does the Biro At St Andrew's do the Biro not do it using actors now then as well? Yes they do they actually use the actors who are going to be there because it's easier This wasn't, this was just a programme Yes cos Alan says he gets copies of that from the Biro Theatre Yes that's right I mean it's a jolly good idea it really is So there are a few initiatives there, but I don't think there's been done anything on the music front though. We do yours from the information that goes out Mhm Morag records it in newspaper Mhm so it's on our tapes anyway Right so it could go on a separate tape if you wanted that to happen, it's on a Mazda tape Mm so it could go on tapes, we could do it Right It's easy for you to have it at the theatre, mhm to take a copy from that Yeah Yeah Could easily do that I perhaps could easily do that they could pick from me up here or, even send it out yeah could even have some at the theatre and Yes Morag does it anyway Mhm so there's no point in duplicating it No so in a way that's not really audio description, although it's No obviously No closely linked, but it's not really But it's always a, a joy for blind people to go to the theatre Yeah Mhm if they're involved, yes that's right Right, I've nothing else, has anybody else have any other topics? Ah, good erm That's rather nice, ah nice It is, it's nice most of them don't work, I've got Date of next meeting? a lovely one over there Oh Yes I've been looking at that and thinking we'll take it, mm Its great isn't it? Probably worth a fortune I find Present it to us yes and doesn't work Oh and doesn't work, well Maybe because it's not wound up Is the mouse dead? the time of day and er Yeah you're quite right, yes Can I ask just a little, it's quite a big question actually, I don't know if anybody will answer it. Is there any research Probably not on the size or the whereabouts of the potential markets that we have as a theatre? Well this is something that we have talked about I mean we touched on how we're going to reach some, but is there any this is something we've, we've talked about and in fact Lucy and I have talked about it Mhm actually we, mm, at some length and had a few ideas, erm I've got an appointment with someone at the Arts Council in a couple of weeks that the Arts Council's got a new fund called erm consultants in research and I thought I'd make a bid to see if we can get someone Mhm to research this audience and ways of getting to it Mhm Mhm Presumably you know roughly how many people are, are already If you look at the number on the register, I've got three and a half thousand Already we can give you these numbers I mean we've got Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything if you're getting ten people turning up It doesn't mean anything No, but it means, it means that we know how we've got to gear up Yes Yes to a lot of things I think what we needs is a What we're ready to pitch that sort of thing That's right, I think what means something is this overall figure and then erm a kind of er an information giving part which points out that what, you know, what seventy five per cent of my twelve thousand had over sixty five Mm fifty per cent over seventy five Mhm but a piece of research would be very good because that would help in honesty when you're trying to get erm organized with er transport and things Yeah That's why we're saying transport important because the majority of people are over seventy five Sure, but it also goes down to do with erm, matinee and doing the evening performance But what, that's right Yes, what should, aha and there's also that's right and there's also people who have been to the theatre before that's not an audience who have Yes, no, oh no And the audience, yeah and it's not like the deaf audience had, had dealing with the have a hearing audience, yes that are older, but the deaf audience which is very young, but other audiences and people who have lost their sight Yes have been to theatre Mhm and who really, could, yeah Who have once enjoyed the theatre , yes The sort of thing is it's bringing them back Yeah, the sort of thing Lucy and I were talking about earlier is, it was just before I went on holiday so my memory is kind of hazy, it's one where I was going to see the Arts Council and see if they were interested in the idea if they work Mhm you know this is the initial chat if they're interested, you know, you suddenly put paper and go back to Lucy and say okay, let's write this down Right, right but I mean it was things like doing questionnaires maybe telephone question phoning people up you know that your three and a half, well not all of them but an example Mhm and she seemed fairly confident about her questionnaire in developing the right question in questionnaire, but I suppose that would be in conjunction with people like you Mm Yes Mhm erm to, to sort of engage a response. It was, it was as much to do with what kind of things would you like to see Mhm listen to Yes, cos that's the other bit isn't it? Aha as, as, it's the choice aspect of it as well as the sort of, if there was an audio description would you go and you know Mhm what kind of things do you want to have audio described, so there are, I mean there's still quite a bit, but she got quite excited about the idea of involving one of the proper, well not proper, one of the, you know, official professional market research firms, as well in terms of doing this work, maybe, maybe getting money from the Arts Council to actually pay them Mhm to do it, although, whether they have this appropriate kind of sensitivity of not I don't know No, mhm so it, it is a sort of it's a kind of sort of liveish topic it's sort of in one of those stages where it's not actually happening yet because a But I mean erm, I mean it it's blatantly obviously at this I think there's a, there's point your thinking how can we get people involved. How can we get the people, yeah. I mean I worked at, as an open afternoon or something where we invite like into the theatre Yes find out what, feel around the theatre, Yes get onto the stage, feel a set, talk to some of the actors Talk to the costume people talk to the costume people you know, talk about make up because a lot of Yes, cos remember at the beginning of all this audio description lots a chat about including all that That's right I was horrified because you know it's like bringing blind people in, doing all this, but something like that, open day, whatever, that'll be wonderful That would that'll be great fun Yeah would encourage people to Mhm That's right, if you're organizing something like that and thinking about it from now, this is only the first of September, but Yes Newspeak's already out Yes That's right so the only, the that the easiest way for me to do Playback's out yeah Playback's out as well, the easiest way for us to get to people is through these Mhm tapes Tapes now the next one doesn't go out until October so you would have to have something in November Mhm to give people time to organize it I think yeah two, two months ahead That would be okay, I mean to let you mention it once two months ahead let you mention it again at least two months ahead and go on about it again so if you had a date in November that you could give me, time to get people together Mhm I have a huge group of people who meet the first Thursday in every month Aha so even to get them there Yes That would help a lot would be a good er Yes getting them in the door is the get them in the door The blind people respond really wanted to come back, yeah well to somewhere they've been Yeah That's right and if they've been there, people have been really nice to them Mhm and it's been good fun, they do want to come back I have thirty or forty people who meet once a month for Oh that's excellent first Thursday in the month Aha and we could get them to you Mhm cos their meeting could just be with you Mhm Yes good idea for that afternoon That'll be ideal, yes That'll be ideal Mm, yeah I think that's a wonderful idea Yes easily organized Mhm If they could see the theatre to see what was going on and an example of audio description Get them into the theatre without a lot of sighted people to push through that's what it's like, yes Yes, that's right, yes Yes and find out where the, the la ladies is Where the loo, it's as simple as that, yes all that kind of thing, yes Yeah It's having that knowledge you know That's right trying to get people together for that Japanese Let them take night I remember Japanese night but that was very difficult to organize because they, they never give us time and, and That's right, yeah if you don't have two months, you can't do it No you can't, you really have time you've got to have two months, mm So your publ your publishing date for this is October? First of October it'll go out First of October Mhm and Iris Probably round about then and then you'll need that So, one final technical point election expenditure. Erm in local elections as again in, in parliamentary or general elections there's a limit as to what a candidate can spend. At the moment that limit's a hundred and fifty pound per ward or division. Plus three pence per vote Er which you might think that again sounds odd and finicky but by the way note I said between w er er it applies to both ward and division. We're aware of that distinction are we not? What's a ward? Well that's what somebody stands be elected To s for what, to be elected to what? To the council. What council? District council. Good. What's a division? It must be county Correct. You represent a ward at district council level or metropolitan council level. You represent a division at county council level. A division is a grouping together of wards. We have the example in Harlow I've forgot, how many councils are there in Harlow, thirty six, thirty eight something? Yeah, it's thirty six isn't it? Got to be because of the election . Erm they all represent an individual ward. There are I think it is what, four county council Harlow so wards group together to become county council divisions. Yeah? Where does that word come from, ward? No-one's ever asked! it's probably Anglo-Saxon. Okay erm further election expenditure. Election expenditure is the responsibility of the political agent. Oh agents exist in different forms really, erm I'm gonna be, we'll be mentioning the notion of political agents in central government later er in, in, in ce in general elections later on. Erm but there is a similarity in both er elections yeah. Anyone standing for election at local government level has to have an election agent. However you can be your own agent. The agent has to fill in the financial returns has to send in a report of financial expenditure. Normally of course a party will appoint a single agent. In other words, at local election, at local election time the Conservative Party will have X candidates standing. There will be a, a Conservative Party appointed agent who will act on behalf of all those candidates and simply fill in the election expenses The accounts are submitted to the returning officer. It's an offence to er exceed the er expenditure. Okay, now here's something coming up that is not only conf it's confusing to students, it's even more confusing to er er the general public. And this is what we can entitle er the electoral sequence. Big diagram coming up. Okay at the top of there, eighty four and ninety four, they're years believe it or not. And down here we've got the names of the different types of council. At the top, county council second metropolitan councils, that is all metropolitan councils that is of course if you remember, a metropolitan council in the area, in, in the area of the old former Mer Merseyside county council, the metropolitan councils would be Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral , Saint Helens, Southport, now they're examples of metropolitan er councils. So metropolitan councils, and here's where the confusions begin to creep in metropolitan councils and some non-metropolitan councils, I E district councils so they're in a separate ca separate category with this electoral sequence. Then we have most non-metropolitan district councils. And finally London boroughs. Right before I fill in some of the details on this again an important point to grasp coming up. In general elections we, we don't normally know for sure until a few weeks beforehand what the date of the election is going to be. All you really know about general, about the general election is that it's gotta be held before the end of parliament's statutory life of five years. Yeah? And we had an example of that, a good example this year of course with erm that in that, in the spring of this year John Major erm had to call an election before June twentieth I think the date was because by that time then parliament would have automatically been dissolved. Yeah? And John Major chose to er erm call the election, dissolve, ask for the dissolution of parliament last year and the election took place in er in, in April. Why does it have to be on a Thursday? It doesn't. Oh. The general elections? Mm. It doesn't. I I thought it did because that was the only day that wasn't a No. However it just so happens the last time an election wasn't on a Thursday was in er I think it was nineteen thirty one when it was held on a Tuesday. But there is nothing laid down in law whereby it has to be a Thursday. That was one of the questions on our entrance exam was What? what day's general election held. Mm well the correct answer is is that normally a Thursday but there is no statutory er obligation that it is Thursday. And indeed in the early part of this century and the nineteenth century elections have been held on Monday, Wednesday Tuesday never a Friday, never a Saturday, never a Sunday. Yeah? It's just one of these common That's general elections we're talking about by the way. We've slightly digressed but I take your, I take your point. It doesn't have to be a Thursday. It just so happens that for the past sixty years it has been. No erm it's, it's more recent than that I think in nineteen fifty the election was on a Tuesday. I think it may, may even be more recent than that. Not that I was there in person. Well I could have been but I couldn't have voted. Erm I was two, that's why. But anyway we've grasped the point that the general elections it's really down to the prime minister to er er to ask for the dissolution of parliament and the prime minister will normally a will normally ask for the dissolution of parliament when he or she thinks they've got the best chance of winning. Major's ex example was rather, was rather a good one because he was running out of time. He didn't want local elections held before the general election. He feared what the results might have been from the local elections and he's, he's an example in fact of a prime minister who went into the elections trailing in the opinion polls. It doesn't you know, it's not something you would normally do. Not when you do have a choice. However let us return to local elections. Every councillor is elected for a fixed four year term of office. And we can predict with certainty the date of local elections because local elections always take place in May. And they normally occur on the first Thursday in May. They don't if that Thursday's May the first then it's the second Thursday but it's normally the first Thursday in May. So we can, we can you know exactly when a local councillor's term of office is up because it's fixed for four years. However and this is why we've got this big diagram coming up however different councils are elected at different points in the electoral sequence. Each council's elected for four years, but councils aren't all elected at the same time. I can illustrate County councils a dot blank here in eighty four eighty five an election year for county councils I E Essex County Council dot dot dot eighty nine an election year dot dot dot and ninety three you'll all be er happy and delirious to know is a county council election year so next May Thursday county council elections will be held. Metropolitan councils, the big city ones with the exception of London of course and some non-metropolitan councils, out of interest Harlow is amongst those some non- metropolitan councils, this is where the confusion often creeps in. I'm writing figure ones there dots blank year one third one third one third dots, blank year one third One third one third one third dots one third. You'll be amazed to know that the system for this, for elections to metropolitan councils is called the system of election by thirds. What does it mean? It means that one third of the councillors are elected in each of three consecutive years. Yeah? And there is a blank year which coincides with county council elections. Harlow's an example of that. How it's done in practical terms is this each Harlow ward returns three councillors yeah? They've all been ele these three councillors have been elected at different, in different years okay? And so a Harlow councillor who was elected in nineteen eighty eight, yeah? Was up for re-election in May this year, nineteen ninety two. That's one third of them got it? Why do they do that, is it ? Well I'll come on to that in a sec. Okay. Yeah. It's a good, very good question. But do we grasp that? I mean some people are looking at me as though I've just revealed some dread secret the world was gonna end tomorrow . Grasp it? Yeah. Like a, a good example the, the the ninety three one, the ninety two one rather this year was a good example because there was erm a titanic battle in Old Harlow where the leader of the council Richard was up for re- election. And as you may be aware that er in, in, in in the local elections this year, in May, the Conservative Party did dramatically well, much better than it did in the general election yeah? And so therefore Richard was, seemed to be he would be in, he was gonna be in very very grave difficulties in getting re- elected for Old Harlow. Old Harlow's a very interesting ward. Erm it's Old Harlow and Churchgate Street it's in therefore, it's in the wealthiest part of town but many of the denizens of Old Harlow and erm Churchgate Street are, are sort of st are, are, are I suppose, you know, bourgeois liberals, bourgeois socialists yeah? It's a bit like Hampstead, yeah? It's got two Labour councillors and one Conservative councillor, used to have three Labour councillors. But there was a really big party struggle there and in Old Harlow erm Conservatives of course very very confident. Er there was a titanic party battle but I think the turn out, the local election turn out was over sixty percent which is dramatically high for local government elections. Erm scraped home by a, by a, by a small number of votes yeah? The liberal vote there almost collapsed to nothing erm while the liberals obviously voted labour tactically in order to prevent the Conservatives from A grabbing the ward, and B erm removing the leader of the council which would have been, which is what they were obviously angling for. Erm it comes back to the point which has just been made about the er, about the erm why have this system of election by thirds and almost backfired on, on, on, on the leader of the council yeah? So that's er that's the system by thirds. One third of the councillors in each of three consecutive years are up for re-election. And there's a blank year in county council here. Of course it's not a blank year for the hard pressed voters of Harlow because they're all voting in the county council elections then for the, for the number of, for the, for the er county councillors who represent at Harlow erm at County Hall in Chelmsford. Have there ever been surveys done erm to see how many people actually understand Yes. the system? Yes. And how many do? Not many. It's not surprising. Mm. People get very confused by it. Mm. And they don't figure they, they get more confused when the county council elections come up in ninety three. Yeah? It's even more confusing cos some systems of by thirds I think they go, they go on wards there's some wards don't have an election one year, when the neighbouring one does. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. Are there any limits to how many times you can stand for councillor? Well, apart from death I mean my erm my, my uncle getting familiar about this, yes? My erm my uncle Jo yes? After whom a huge block of flats in Liverpool is named after, yeah? Morgan Heights, yeah? Not to be confused with He er, he stood down as erm as a, as a er Labour councillor in, in Liverpool in Walton er ward what are we in now, nineteen ninety two in nineteen ninety or ninety one, yeah ninety one at the age of eighty six and he'd been a Liverpool councillor off and on for over fifty years. Twice refused the offer of the parliamentary seat at Walton. Anyway most non-metro district councils oh by the way, sorry and parishes I always . We always forget about the poor parish council don't we? They, like the county councils, go in for what's known as the poll council system as opposed to the system of election by thirds. That is, just as a county council in eighty five, all the councillors are up for re-election just as in a parliamentary general election, yeah? In eighty seven all the councillors of most district councils are up for election. So if you go up the road to Epping their elections take up all the councillors that are elected together. Eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety ninety one There's a, again a possibly interesting link here with general elections erm eighty three of course was a, was a er an election year for non-metropolitan er district councils yeah? It's just, it's just off our little chart there. Those elections take place in May right? In May eighty three and again in May eighty seven Margaret Thatcher chose to go to the country the month after those elections. June eighty three and June eighty seven. Four in, in both those occasions she was four years into her term of office. Elected first in seventy nine and then obviously in eighty three. And what happened in eighty three and eighty seven of course was that the local elections take place the Conservative party managers analyzed the results, fed them through the computers and you could come up with the fact that you would, looked like you were set to win a general election. And so therefore the local elections were seen as a pointer to the general elections. Why? Because it also happens, it happens to be the case that in local elections people tend to vote on national issues or perceptions. They don't vote on local issues. Local elections just tend to be national reflect the national concerns, issues or reflects the unpopularity of the government pa of the governing party or whatever, yeah. You don't tend to vote on purely local issues. one of the reasons for introducing the community charge that and it's ironic that it was just possible, especially in nineteen erm ninety erm that the community charge was meaning wa was bringing about a change where people were voting on local issues, the prime local issue of course being what would be the level of the, of the community charge. And that was one of the justifications of bringing it in, that it would raise a sense of er it would raise erm the actual percentage of people voting in elections and it would make local issues er more pertinent at local elections. We will never know how that would develop because community charge has been abolished but anyway You will note of course as well that last year in nineteen ninety one, the Conservative Party managers looked at the local election result and decided not to go in June ninety one, cos they figured they would get beaten. Surely if the erm turn out is er erm doesn't really It's much big it's a, it's it's a, it's an incredibly wide sample opinion poll. Because we're talking millions of voters yeah. If you get a forty percent turn out in a local elect within England yeah? If you get a forty percent turn out in England and Wales, we're talking many millions of voters. And when you think that the biggest opinion poll samples are what five, ten thousand? So it's pretty, it's, it's a much more accurate guide than any opinion poll. Erm again I, I can't help but s er er getting slightly digressed but it is rather interesting that John Major this year decided to go for a general election before the local elections. The advice was was not to hang on and see what the May elections er looked like. Couple of reasons, one was on a much smaller sample yeah? But B of course if you did badly in those elections in May the government might have done badly in May, then morale would have been rock bottom of having to go into an election, he would have had to go for an election six weeks later or they'd run out of time, yeah. But the real the real glorious irony I think that cheers up erm psephologists like me, political analysists, is that in those May elections the Conservatives did dramatically well compared to what they'd done in the general election. In the general election they'd won it, but their majority was down. In the local elections their share of the vote was and they did very very well. Why? Anyone possess any theories about that? They were reflect they were reflecting national issues erm like the Well did it really have time to do that? just on a,were just on a general high anyway after the election results. Yeah. There's that fact that the Conservatives were on a high of course. I mean these local elections only took place what, erm four weeks after the general election, the Conservatives were on a high and conversely therefore you could say that what? Labour voters are gonna be disillusioned Labour Labour voters were er to say the least dis disappointed I think is more the, is the word rather than disillusioned isn't it? Disappointed. Gutted. Yes, possibly gutted is the better word, right. But there's another interesting fact that as well erm and it's borne out, I know opinion polls had a rather bad erm er er got a bad press in the general election er because they weren't very accurate and it was odd this because their, their accuracy levels had becoming er had, had, had been becoming frighteningly er accurate say in eighty seven you know? But they take opinion polls all the time, I mean shortly after the recent general election they were taking opinion polls a week later. They d they do it all, they do it throughout the year we just, we just don't there's just not so many of them, and we don't read about them so much as we do before big elections. The point is this, after a general election the party that's won, it's share of the vote in the most, in, in the, in the opinion poll taken most immediately after the election it goes up, it's higher than actually what it gets in the general election. Why? This is just purely a human fact. People want to be associated with a winning team don't they? A cigar and a coconut over there, yeah. There's a tendency to associate yourself with the winning, with the winner. Yeah? And people who might even have voted Labour, or Lib Dem at the general election, at the first opinion poll they'll say they vote Conservative. So it's strange but it's er maybe it's not so strange Why do you think get it so horribly wrong this time round in the general election? I beg your pardon? How did, why did the erm opinion polls just get it so horribly wrong this time round? Well they've come up with a lot of theories haven't they. Erm one the reluctance of many Conservative voters to reply to opinion polls for s some reason. Two erm erm in some areas erm people are just bloody minded and say they're gonna vote one way the oth the other. There's n it's an interesting fact that as well that erm opinion polls are very often, it depends what the question you're asked and when, when, when during elections people are asked are you prepared to s to have either A lower taxes or B myself up I wake myself up. I did that once. You're waking yourself up, yeah. Violent kick. you really are running, you know how dogs' legs do this, cos they're running after Ben's and he kicked me last night. I was just dropping off to sleep and you know how you're just thinking, yeah, mm what are we gonna do this weekend, and all of a sudden, Ben's legs went and kicked me really hard,and I thought oh my God something awful's happened, and you, you really do, you move a lot. You think as well, which is very irritating, ask some of you this, but Who would like some more coffee? Yes please. Anyone like some more coffee? Me, me. first. No, it's really funny, sit down. Have you got a cup? Sit down a minute. Erm, what was I gonna say, oh Laura, Laura, and you say No, no, nothing like that. So. My grandmother has like How do you like your coffee? Strong, please. My grandmother Milk and sugar. Oh, this is good, I won't talk My g erm, pressure behind the eye,yo fluid builds up as pressure at the back of the eyes, Right. and you eventually go blind from it, if you don't erm, don't catch it early enough. So anyway my grandmother has it and it's hereditary you see, so my dad's, my dad keeps saying to me, you know, make sure you get your eyes checked, make sure you get your eyes checked. Yeah. Now, I and I went to other day, I was having quite bad headaches from the back of my eyes, feeling like, you know, I had pressure there, and so, I think it was just headaches but I wanted to go and check it out, and I went to the, cos my dad said oh if you go to the opticians erm, they give you free checks as you've got glaucoma in the family, and erm, or glaucoma, or whatever you call it. So I went in, and they said, oh yes, but they're free on the N H S, if you're over forty, so I thought great, you know. Yeah. I've got another twenty years to go blind. Yeah. So what Yeah, exactly. Well, they said, I said well, so I've got to wait twenty years? They said well,you're not likely to have, to have it. I said well, yeah. Well, I didn't say this, but I thought, well I'm not likely to have it before I'm forty, but then, what if I do? anything, are you? Exactly. Anyway, so I, I was getting a bit worried about it, and, I can, cos I was having these headaches, and I started talking to Phil and I, I hadn't really said much to him about it. It was late at night and I decided, I was just sort of talking I'd say, I can't get rid of this headache, and I don't know what I'm gonna do, I don't whether I should just not worry about it cos I'm not that old,and I was really pouring my heart out to him, and he turns round and he says, yeah, you need a new clutch you really need a new clutch. I said, Phil,answers,and I said Phil and I started to laugh, cos I just thought, I wasn't going to get upset about it, so I just started to giggle. And erm, it was quite nice actually, cos I was getting really worried, Yeah. and, and, so I was just giggling away,talk a load of rubbish, and no no,you need a new clutch,forget it, forget it. I just turned over and went back to sleep . would you like some more coffee? And in the morning, he had absolutely no recollection of it at all. Mm. Needs a new clutch. No, it's terrible. I hate, it's so irritating because when I go to, to bed, I'm never tired. So I always sit up in bed for ages really wide awake, and I'm reading and doing all sorts of thinking like things, and I'd be talking to Ben, and he would say yeah, yeah, and he's really vague as well, and I, I get really angry and then I think you can tell because then you tend to lean across and say, are you alright, are you alright, and I just find it makes it worse. Mm. Do you see what I mean? I might, for Phil, for Phil to wind down, he'll come in, say we've been out for a meal or whatever, he'll come in and he'll sit down in front of the television. Now that to me is not Only for five minutes. I know, I just don't how you can do it. Erm, whereas I Are you alright? Yeah, sorry. erm, I like to talk, so he's wound down, you know, really sleepy, comes to bed, and I'm like, that's when I wind down by chatting away and saying, you know, little snippets of things that have happened to you during the day, and he's just like, oh, shut up, go to sleep, you know. And erm, you know I want to talk and wind down so I now exactly what you mean. I, I used to get in the night, didn't I? Mm. I couldn't sleep. My mum's like that, she gets up at Hours two in the morning I used to get up about three,the fire, and things like this, and I used to get really bored. Cos you know, obviously nobody wants to talk to you at three o'clock in the morning, fast asleep aren't they, not much fun is it? I used to get up and read, and oh it's so true. My mum wakes up and I wake up at two, because she's pottering around in the kitchen,, banging about a bit more than usual. mother are you alright? And she'd say oh, yes she gets up most nights now, in the middle of the night. Yeah, I know. How many hours do you need? Erm, I go through stages, normally I need eight hours' sleep, always eight hours' sleep, but I don't really sleep in. She doesn't feel sort of She goes to bed quite early cos she gets very tired with work. So she goes to bed early a couple of hours, Not really? All she'll do, is she'll sleep through to, she'll sleep through to like six, and then get up and that's it for the day. I know. Cos I just wake up in the night. I mean, if I can have twelve hours, then I'm happy. Really? But if I don't have nine I'm not worth talking to, really. We'll have to get a tablecloth. Nine? Yeah. Really? You have to have a lot of sleep. I really need sleep. Really awful. The thing is, that I can go, for then, weeks and weeks with like six or seven hours, Yes, that would be great. and then the first day I stop, I've usually got flu, I'm exhausted, I can't get out of bed, I feel rotten, but if I keep going for like, three weeks to a month, just on six hours, that's fine, but the first day I stop I'm like, in bed for a week ill usually. You stop what? Like six hours, seven hours sleep a night. I was saying, I need sort of eight, nine, and I could easily sleep for twelve hours. Oh, so do I. I could go to bed early and it's sort So do I. I'm terrible, if I've gone to bed really late, quite, you know, I just can't catch up. Mm. I'm awful, I mean, that's why I got up, you know when you phoned me this morning, and said, I am sorry, have I got you out of bed, and I was like really grateful, because I can't stand sleeping in. I always used to sleep in, until we got married. Then he wakes me up when he goes out of the door in the mornings. You were, you used to sleep in really late. Oh, yeah, I know, when I used to stay, cos Helen and I were as bad as each other, weren't we, though we didn't encourage each other very much to get up early. Helen was terrible. Helen was worse than me, I got up for Neighbours, I mean, she was really dead. Yeah. if she could make it. Yes, she does, she gets up in the middle of the day, doesn't she? Really? If she's got nothing to do, yeah. But she doesn't so much now, cos she's Yeah. But erm, now I get up at eight o'clock every morning, and this morning I slept in till ten, but that's cos I was up till four, working on Thursday night. God, what were you doing? Valponi Er,or not I can't really stay in bed past nine o'clock. Normally eight o'clock. In the morning? Yeah. I can't go to bed very early though, any more. I used to be able to go to bed early and go to sleep. Yes, cos I always used to go to bed a lot earlier than you guys. Mm. I say, the reason I think I had bad dreams, recently, in the last sort of three nights, is because they're the three nights I went swimming early, so I thought I better go to bed early. So I was in bed about eleven, instead of two in the morning. Mm. Which meant I probably was like awake to start with, because I, although I got up at seven, I still wasn't ready to go to bed at eleven, cos it was still too early, and usually I go to bed about two. Body clock's sort of Yeah, my body clock was like, still really really active. Cos usually I'm just like in bed, and that's it. and when I have to get up, I have to get up. changed about midnight whereas when I changed go to bed. Charlotte I'm much better at going to sleep with noise around me, though now, cos I can't tell when by body clocks, tends to shut your eyes, so I just blot it out now. I've managed to Been quite noisy upstairs. Not quite noisy, Often they come in about half an hour after we've gone to bed, so you're still not quite asleep. Yeah. Probably no difference Well, that's it. Yeah. tend to get used to. Yeah, yeah. I used to be constantly telling them to shut up There you go. I was a real pain in the arse, wasn't I? No, not really. The worse thing is, when I, I am desperate to get to sleep, cos then You can't. Because, because then you do, exactly, if they make any noise, I'd be like, will you shut up. And then that makes it even worse because you go round and round in circles, and you know and the more The more angry you get Exactly and I used to get really angry with Alison shuffling around, but they do it even, I mean, they've got to get their sofabed out every night, that sort of thing. Oh, right. And so, you can imagine the sort of noise they make, Lisa? people upstairs, cos they live in, they live in the space of our bedroom and bathroom. You're joking. No, My goodness. I know. What, and the, and Wh where the ceiling changes height. Yeah, where the ceiling goes up. There's from there back to the bathroom. From there to the bathroom. That is all they've got? That's all they've got. Oh, my life. That's just one room. I know. I mean, I don't how they put up with each other. So, when we, you can imagine the noise that they I mean, it's not their fault. It's not being any more noisy than we are here, but No, above you it seems more noisy. Exactly, and when they come in it's really loud. You know about it. And they're traipsing around the room, getting the bed out, doing this that and the other. We're amazed that we can hear the people downstairs, cos we can hear them like, you know, if you hear somebody above you, walking here dong dong dong dong, above, you can hear it for some reason, below on the ground floor. Even more, and it really, and if you are on your own, They must have a sprung floor, or something. it really sounds like someone's coming upstairs. Yeah. You think there's somebody on your level. Cos you didn't always hear it. It's only No. certain occasions. smelly substances as well. Yeah their illegal substances. Oh, no. Smoking illegal substances. They have, yeah. I coming up through the floorboards. Perhaps they're walking on the ceiling, that's why you can hear it. I wanna go now. You can really smell, can you smelt it, Claire I thought, I thought someone had been smoking in the toilets. Yeah. Is it? Smoking in the toilets, yeah. I didn't like to say anything,but Well, when I came in, I thought, somebody's Yeah, probably in the toilet area, kitchen toilet. Oh good, I'm glad we got that sorted out. I think, I think that, I don't think they smoke all the time upstairs, but like, in the summer, er, basically this place just had its windows and doors open all day long, every day. And erm, one day we had friends round, and I went into the loo it stinks of smoke in here, it was really bizarre, and I, I went, and sort of just thought oh, and then I went in again, and I really did smell, and I thought, this is really odd, and so when I came out here I said, did anyone else smell smoke in the ba in the bathroom, and they said oh yeah, I could smell cigarette smoke, and then, it must have just been upstairs, and it wafted down, and in through ours, cos there was no one else really around. It's just like really bizarre. Mm. Yeah, it was really strong in the loo, just around the loo. It was, really really strong. Especially in the toilet. That's why,and they were smoking out the window, er, up here. I don't know. Yeah. But I mean, sometimes our house does smell, friendly. And that's why Oh, that's a shame. Sometimes, I've never smelt it before, though, since Yeah, but I always remember in, in the lounge there was, always seemed to be weird smells. Oh, that's when they came to change the curtains. Mm. This place smells funny sometimes, and I really start getting paranoid, sort of, spraying air, air re actually. it's that kind of smell, he's into. No it does. You know when we came in the other day, you came to see the sofa? Mm. Didn't it smell odd? You don't remember? I don't think so, no. Maybe it's just me. You get paranoid, though, don't you? I don't like it being very stuffy. But because when you got the, you think you got the heating on and you're paying for the heating, and you open the windows. It's ridiculous. But I don't like it being stuffy, so this morning, I had all the windows open, cos it's nice and sunny and, erm, I had the windows open. But no, it's quiet, we can hear them down there can't we? Yeah, surprisingly. Oh, can you? But then again, we can only hear them at the moment, but there are six of them. Yeah, that's true. There's four. There's two underneath the two couples. Two living in their, our lounge equivalent, and two living in my bedroom, equivalent, and then I thought there was just of them downstairs There are, but they've got his brother, his, Sam's boyfriend's brother, and his girlfriend and then their friends as well and they're both, they're all Kiwis, they're, they're all over from It's really sweet. Yeah, but they're all over them. They're all gonna start to share, all gonna start sharing the place. They're all gonna start sharing the place together, cos it would be cheaper. Is that why they're moving out? Yeah, they're moving out at the end of this month. We've gotta have them round. Yeah. Really? Yeah. We feel really bad, we don't So they can leave us We haven't met any of the other people that live How many flats are there here? Thr four, including ou including ours. Well, we've met the guy who lives up above us, because he jumped out of bed, they've got french windows like we have, up above there, and he jumped out, and we were just sitting watching the telly or something, we heard these footsteps like going across the ceiling, it's as though we could see 'em, cos we could sort of hear it and feel it. Real weird. And we nipped out there, and sort of looked up at him, and it was like, oh hi, we like go, is it safe up there? Yeah. We had us some con weird conversations with this guy standing on our roof. Yeah, we hear this television is . Was it, yeah. Do you have to pay for your T V licence plus all the other flats separately? Don't know, We don't need to pay, it's per household, isn't it? We don't have to pay for ours. No. But I mean, per household, do you have to pay? Yeah, it's not is it? No. Individual. Bit of a shame. Mm. We think this is really disgusting, I don't know whether anybody noticed, but, on the back of the T V licence, we got our T V licence through, apparently if you are registered blind, you get one pound and twenty nine P off your off your T V licence. I know. Off, eighty three pound. Big, big deal it's disgusting, isn't it? What an insult, honestly. Couldn't believe it, could we? You'd think you'd get twenty five percent off, or something minimum. Get it free One pound, twenty five. credit. What, do they Do you get two pound fifty off if you're deaf and blind and blind. Feel the screen. Braille, braille television. horrible. Charlotte, you gonna have some I can't believe it. Sorry, I'm what, oh, didn't you know Erm, I was gonna say something. Erm, yeah, I was gonna say, it's not even just like listening to the radio, is it, because they're catering for the, for the sighted, they're not, you know, if it was on radio, they'd say more, but I mean, it's television, but Does it end up making sense No. television is a more visual thing You could listen to the news on the telly and it wouldn't make any difference, but if you're watching a programme, Yes. there's a lot of gesture Yes. and, and looks and things Yes. going on that you've missed. it would be a bit That's a new thing It's not as if they could read the Radio Times and see It's alright, leave it in the we need some time . Erm, I got interviewed on radio once, on, on television once with a friend and they asked, they asked us what we did, and this friend of mine said we were radio mime artists. Gee, thanks. Oh, no. Like we're really going to be taken seriously now. What was this for? That was with . What was it for? Don't ask who it was with, they asked you what it was for. It was erm, it was one of these sort of things, where you could go on and record your bit. If erm, if you got a thing that you're feeling uppity about. Oh, no. it makes on our W T coding thing. Yeah. The London Sport, or whatever it is. Mm. Yeah, but were you the sort of people that walk into hospitals and start praying for the sick to be healed. Really weird, honestly, when you, you really had the faith it would happen and it quite often Really? Yeah. But it's the fact that the guy gave erm, my friend Billy, erm, died a few years ago, erm, but they, they were like best mates and they used to ju just encourage each other to like, jump on a train and come up to London, and start going in all the hospitals and praying for the sick and things like that. Oh, they're really weird pe er not weird. That's down there in that photo with his wife. Oh, right. Actually, before he moved away, he, he gave up his designing job and he was working in for a bit. And erm, you don't know this, but when, when I used to go round there, he used to moan about all, no, he didn't moan, but Oh you did tell me. What about all the girls. The girls. The girls in campus, blinking heck Phil, they keep coming out in their underwear and saying, can you get me this size, or can you get me that size, you know, what am I supposed to do you know. Keep banging his head against the wall. He was a great guy. He phoned up, a guy erm, Head of er Air Canada. Top guy. He found out the guy's name, right, he First name. Yeah, first name. He phones up and he says, oh hello, can I speak to Tom, and then, and erm, this woman, receptionist, whatever, obviously thought oh well, he knows the guy Yes. so she him put him straight through and then goes, Mr Smith, erm, my name's Mike , er, you don't know me, but I'm a graphic designer and er, my wife and I are trying to emigrate to Canada, and erm, I'd like you to send me some business and give me two free tickets for it. Really? And the guy did it as well, sent him some business. He did a couple of hours' work, and he got two free tickets to Canada. Cos otherwise they'd never have been able to afford to go, so Wow. And it took him about twenty five minutes. How old is he now? He's now twenty eight. Oh, who was the one that died, then? Same age. No, that's his friend. Really? Yeah. Blimey. He was on a pushbike and he was sucked into the slip, into the strip blah, into the slipstream of a car lorry Ooh But he, he built up his own graphic design business, by designing something, say, Quality Street. He'd look at that and say, I think that's a really outdated adve erm, design. Mm. So he'd design a new one, and he'd write to the guy at Quality Street and say look, I think, I'm a graphic designer, I think your box is a load of rubbish, I've designed this, will you pay me for it? Really? And he built up a whole business just by picking famous names and saying, look I think your design is really outdated and it's not doing your image any good. How about this? Mm. I couldn't believe that he just about had the audacity to phone this guy up. Yeah, but that's how you get Yeah, exactly. I mean, that must be a thousand pounds' worth of air tickets. And they lost a fortune on their house, trying to sell it. And erm, It took him twenty five minutes on, on his computer, So he just and that was it. Fiddling around, yeah. He just gets Mm, if you don't know these things, if you don't try these things, you don't even you always do it, don't you Claire, you're quite happy to barter with people in these situations It's the way we got our house. I think, yeah, I think you need to be sometimes like that are awful. they saw our house Friday, and they rang me up, and I said look, you know, I've got, I've got my exams today and I really don't want to come up unless you see something, if you do, I will come up because they reckon it's a joint effort, if we're gonna live together, we've all got to see it and make a contribution to looking at the house. So anyway, they rang me up Friday night, and said, oh, seen this house, it's lovely and really nice. What's the arrangement? We'll meet you there at twelve o'clock Saturday, right. Right, I'll meet you at McDonald's blah blah blah. So anyway, we got down here, eaten sandwiches by then. and erm, Yeah. when we got down there, and erm, rang the bloke and he wasn't in and we kept ringing and he wasn't in. We just thought, they said, oh, we'll show you where it is, so we drove round there, and no, he wasn't there, and, so of course, we drove back there about four or five times during the day, and like we drove past there one time and there was a woman standing outside, she said like, oh what do you want, I was like, oh well, we've come to see the house . So by the end of the day, I was like, look I've come all this way, which wasn't totally true, but I said, look I've come all this way, the bloke arranged that he would meet us at this time, and he's not here, and like, you know, I've come two and a half hours in the car, and I've gotta drive home again, and we were gonna have a look at the house. So by the end of the day, we'd met Sam, we knew her, we'd been in her house, we'd looked around her house. We found out that the neighbours on the left hand side, who were in fact an elderly couple, and his son was working erm, and he had his own business working at home. Then we had erm, the other people next door, the woman erm, who was supposed to be a man-eater, we'd actually looked round her house and it was ident identical to ours and we looked, we looked all the way round her house and like, she said, oh yeah, all the building's the same but just in reverse and like, we met all the neighbours, plus the woman opposite hadn't seen the flat, I mean, what's wrong Of course you can. so anyway You can actually see but then, on the other hand, I'm not the sort of person who, I mean, if it's something like that I can ask people, but I've got friends who are quite cheeky, who will ask things, I mean, like if somebody does something for me, I'm like, are you sure, are you sure, you don't mind, and like, I'm like over the top the other way. But if you're just generally talking to people and not actually asking anything of them, Yeah. I'm very willing, but seeing as someone's doing something for me, I'm like you sure you don't mind? People get like actually annoyed and I just like what do you mean, I mean, you're doing it anyway, it's no problem. My mum's the sort of person who'll just argue with anything, if she thinks she'll argue with anybody, or anything if she thinks that she's being swindled, so like,she even went to the extent of having, they, we had an extension built, right, and she, we had it, only fair's fair, this one particular suite, we had erm, and they, they had this absolutely massive bathroom built,okay not specifically to have a nicer bathroom, but to have a very big room and erm, so they had two sinks, this sounds real extravagant, erm, Is there another glass out there? Where do you keep the glasses? Down, under There's one there. In the front of the bar cupboard. Yeah, it is yours. Erm, they've got two things, a bidet, a toilet, a corner bath and a corner shower on the other side, right? Is this in one room? In one room . Goodness. I know. It's, it's wider than this room, and it's easily from here to the end of the kitchen. Yeah, I see. No, it's not. What a load of rubbish. Philip, no, that's an exaggeration, come on, it's about as wide, it's as long as this room It's about that big it's about as long as this room, and probably a bit wider. But it just, because they had it, they had our, our double garage and that knocked down A quite big It is isn't it The bath must be the size of a sofa. Oh, yeah. Well, it's not that long, but it's in Yeah, well you know that sur with the surround and everything and if it's Oh, come on, let's not over exaggerate. Is this because they built onto the to have a big bathroom. Do you have to embarrass your parents bathroom. Well, what it was was, erm, cos my grandmother was very ill,granddad's sort of And they've got a, and they've got a sort of washstand in there. Can I. Oh , for goodness sake. How big's their Claire. They had a double garage knocked down, and built around the area, Right. so they just had building built on top of it, Right. and my parents had, Mm. because of that, they've got a very big bathroom and a very big bedroom, Right. because they just, two rooms, Right. put over the top of the, Yeah, yeah. yeah, garage. So erm, cos downstairs, we had it all extended, so we could have a disabled bathroom and that sort of thing and, Right. instead of going use the garage. I can't see the point of having a bathroom that doesn't work. What do you mean, a bathroom that doesn't work? Oh, sorry, sorry. Are you trying really to piss me off? No. Well, what do you mean? It was a joke. A disabled bathroom. Erm, Yes, it doesn't matter what I was saying, anyway. Is this, is this We know what you mean. Is it separate from the bedroom? It's not in the bedroom, it's Is the, the bathroom's not in the bedroom, is it? This is separate. Yes. A separate room. What I was saying was, just that like, they had all these pieces of furniture in there, it was supposed to be a suite, but my mum, my mum got round and tell you every single piece that was a different colour or the wrong shape, or didn't fit on the pedestal properly, or this and that, and she had the whole lot changed at least three times. Really? Yeah, and cos we had, we had the bathroom that was originally there, that they knocked through to build all this extension, was converted into a shower room, and she didn't think that the sink was right in that, and the disabled bathroom had at least two or three pieces that she thought bolshie in that as well, Really? and after just that they kept sending the wrong pieces, I mean, like they, they sent another piece to replace it, and it was it was just as bad, Yeah. my mum wasn't having it. Everyone else was just,everyone else could have all the faulty stuff, they may not complain, but I'm going to, Yeah, I have to stick to my guns, I'm paying a fortune for this stuff, why should I have faulty Exactly. furniture. Even if the whole lot's being processed like, perhaps it shouldn't be, and then of course your standards aren't good enough. So sh mum's had a my mother, but she's got what she wants. My friend had, they had er It's taken a year to get it all. What's that big kitchen fur is it Schr Schreiber? Schreiber. Yeah, they had them come and fit their kitchen and they really did pay thousands of pounds for it, and erm, there was a chip erm, one of the units on the top and they, they just fitted it like it, and my, their dad called them back and said, look you know, I'm paying thousands of pounds for this. That's got quite a lot of money off for it. They, they said well we can redo it for you, they said we can give you a reduction in it, and he sort of bartered with them, and I think he got, you know, a good couple of hundred pound off just for this little chip in the unit. I should think so. I mean, if you're paying for these things, and you know, fair enough. My parents had fitted cupboards and wardrobes, you know, fitted like throughout their room, it's like, the normal two cupboards on one side, the cupboards above, plus the extra fitting and like wall fittings and, then the back bits by the bed, and then they had stable door and the big long dressing table and the end unit, and they actually bought different side panels for different wardrobe fittings. Like they got, I don't know, something called Shadow, yeah. which was like sort of beige colour with gold erm, handles, and they sent a sort of bluey colour side rails and top, and thought they, they'd get away with it. I mean, they were actually looking at it and we were going, but it's not the same furniture. Yeah. No. And they were like, oh, oh well, what you mean, you, you're not prepared to have it. And like my parents sort of went, the thought that they gave them money that we had for it, yeah Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's like you could actually, I mean once my mum had pointed it out, I'd never had noticed, but you walked into the bathroom and you thought, yeah, Mm. they are different colours. But like, obviously the bath and shower, cos they're plastic, they're not going to be exactly the same colours, so that's quite good, you can get away with that. But the two sinks the bidet and the toilet, were all like different shades, and you just like, yes, but is this all supposed to be the same thing. yeah. And like, in the di in the disabled bathroom the, the er, it's not on a proper pedestal, so it's sitting on it Mm. it's just got a bit to cover the pipes, so it just like, sits on the wall, so that you can get a wheelchair underneath. Mm. and it's much lower down, and this thing, it's like a gap, it's like this big around the bottom of the sink, so like it wasn't even touching the sink, the, the pedestal bit under bits underneath, it's like, it had a sort of similar sort of shape, so it should fit, but it was like, a massive gap underneath, like no Yeah. I think a lot of people tend to put up with things, don't they? Well, they do, that's right. Don't like to complain. When you just think, the number of houses, not everybody can go through that, cos otherwise they would have done something about it. Yeah, that's true. Mm. In fact, to happen time and time again. Mm. It's like when we were in Cyprus, the amount of things that you can actually barter for. Do you know what I mean? Mm. And like, they'd say, this was so much money, and mum would say, any chance of a discount? And I think by the time she'd finished it would be half price, she'd walk out with the thing half price, and she'd say, well you know, it's just, they make up prices and you go to another shop and it would be the half price marked, and you go into another shop it would be, you know, over there. Yeah. That's what their, that's the whole way they trade. Over here you know, it's marked up that, and you just don't dare to But then the thing is that my mum comes back here, and she's buying and she's like, any chance of a discount, and I thought mum, because she's like so into that lifestyle, now, Yeah. like the culture, but it's amazing how many people, even in England, if you do have the audacity to ask Mm. they will say, oh, alright then. And they give a, though she's not being like, really cheeky, it's because she's been living in a culture for four years, where that's the way they, they sell and buy. Mm. But because she's back here, she still sometimes does it, and in fact they do do it for her. If I'm in a shop and I find something that's slightly faulty, and I think, well I could easily fix that. I go up to the counter say, erm, I'd like this please, but it's actually got this tear in it, or whatever's wrong with it, erm, can you give me some discount? But a lot of places say, well, is there another one that's alright. Yes. Mm. And so, you They'd rather sell you the full price, yeah. Yeah, exactly. say that about Some, some places say oh, yeah, alright then, I'll give you such and such off. It's the big warehouse places, you know, the big stores that aren't interested, if because Yeah. it's all mass produced and they might as well not sell it to you, and send it back to the manufacturers and get a full discount. True. Yeah. Sometimes if you offer to pay for things for cash, you get a discount, Mm. because they have to pay, sort of, two or three percent on Yeah, we did that, when you bought our erm, and things. when we bought our chest of drawers. Mm. We got twenty five off didn't we? Yeah. Really? Yeah. But I think that was I never ask, I mean, that's really stupid of me, which I, I wish I did, I just always just, I don't know, I'm really stupid like that. Never any harm in asking, though, is there, as you say You ask. Pardon? You ask. Haven't really You remember have you. Well, that's the thing, I think it's the English attitude, of It depends, it depends on what it is, doesn't it? oh don't, don't ask, because you don't want to look as if , Yeah. either you haven't got the money or you don't want to Yeah because people look at you, and just like, oh gosh how scummy. Well, it's just that, But it's not. I wouldn't I wouldn't even think of asking. Mm. The best thing to get richer is like, going round car boot sales, like my mum, she's so funny, dad said she's a different woman, she's just like, cos when Phil and I erm, were engaged, we were trying to save up money, so we, oh and like we'd sell off all our old stuff, so just give me of money, and then, we got these and my mum was pricing everything up, and she's going, if someone asks for a discount, don't, just don't give it to them, she said, everyone's going round pricing everything up and erm, when they come to you, they just, they just want things for nothing. She's going on and on about everybody wants something for nothing. And she's just like, this really officious and then, she just said, everybody goes round, and they try and get the cheapest price and they go back to the place that are giving the cheapest price, whatever. She'd say, stand your ground, don't, you know, sort of like, then she goes round to everybody else, trying to get everything for nothing. Yeah, exactly. Funny, though, watching people, Yeah. cos I mean, I had to help my dad with a car boot sale, this is a man who doesn't buy anything erm, secondhand People just turn vicious. Really? would only shop in Harrods. And there he was at a car boot sale, it was like Well, it's amazing what people will buy. I know. You get couples who shop together and then they get addicted to your car boot, and they want everything and it's quite amusing. I've had people, I've, I've driven up and it's in the pouring rain, and you've people just, they hoard round your car as you drive up. You can't actually get things out of your car. And you take out a box of stuff and they're sorting through the stuff and you're like, excuse me, and you're trying to get your tables out you know. and your things put on, Mm. and you know, all this sort of stuff, and they won't even let you get things out the car, I mean, they are in your car it's like And then you all go round the car boot and they have their own car and they'll be selling your stuff out of it. I've had people come up and buy records and tapes and things and they've gone back to their stall which is all they sell is records and tapes. Right. and they've priced them up. Honestly. They've bought them off yo them off you, say for three pound My gosh. and selling them at seven. Crikey. So you really have to keep an eye out. You gotta know what you're on about. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I got wise to it after a while. Yeah. I had some guys come up, and they were, they were really pissed off with me because, my mum sort of like, this guy just done this with th th the stall next door, but he left some stuff that he obviously already had things of, which he didn't think it was worth him buying, and this guy came round, and they were obviously from one of these, you know how you get erm, secondhand erm record stores yeah. yeah, actual, you know, shops that and erm, there's these two guys together and they were really trying to intimidate me, I mean like, big stuff. They, they priced everything up, and they said, right that's eleven pounds, what can you do me for. I said, I beg your pardon? Said, well what price would you give me? I said, the prices are marked on the thing That was provided by erm Oh yeah, it's really good. It really picks up things very well. Yeah. Yeah, it's excellent. Yes, they're really expensive to buy, they're about ninety quid to buy. You'll just have to what, those walkmans Yeah, 'cos that's got a radio you can use with it, as well. Mm. You can use it for an interview. They don't usually have record buttons, do they? No. Mm. Well, last night, I went through all the different topics, you know, the composer situation. And I went through them and I I narrowed it down to three things now. Task or topic What you were gonna Mm. do in your essay? Either that I thought you were reading the Alchemist or something. I was, but I erm, Well, I finished that. Oh, good. Finished it all, and then, I just decided then I sorted out my washing, and then I decided what part I was gonna do, I'd narrowed it down to either topic, task or topic erm, stable features, which are, sort of, erm, self confidence and things, and erm, how you you express yourself, and then a third one is like sex an and gender and age. Do you have to do all this from the tapes that have been recorded. Well. Yeah, you're meant to do your own recordings. If if not, you supposed to record, they're supposed to be, in fact, two minutes, and I couldn't read, 'cos two minutes is about half two sides of of transcript, so that's all we need really. So it's otherwise, it would be just too big to analyse. Plus, all us, we had to do erm, transcribe five minutes. Well do you know how long that would, Mm. can you imagine how long that would take, it would just be impossible. We were o on and I thought, no way, and then Marianne said, no, it's ju , she said, that's too much, we'll be, and like, erm,, we'll knock off er, five hundred words of your assignment, if you do five minutes of thing, and that's, no way. , really. you're gonna do well over five hundred words, bloody writing it out. so Marianne well, she said, she said, well okay then, do five hundred. Like both sides, to do like two and a half pages. Well, I don't mind doing that. Thing is, they say, take half an hour to transcribe two minutes, but that's probably by professionals anyway. It does, the thing is, if you've got a lot of speakers Mm. Becaus I mean, the the one I've got here,the one I've got, erm, er that I taped on Saturday night, there's seven people on it, and they all keep cutting across each other on it, it would just be impossible. Mm. Was it a good conversation, though? Bet that was good though The effects when listening back to it. How are you It was just like being at the cinema, but it's just like being, it's just like being in the room again, because of the conversation's back. Was this seven girls, or No, there's there's Phil, and erm, Nicole's erm, the girl she lived with last year, her and her boyfriend came. Oh. So there's two blokes and five girls. And we, it's really funny because of we started off the evening talking about leg waxing . The conversation keeps coming back to leg waxing at every quarter of an hour, it's really funny. Really. Yeah. Oh my God. No. Who does it then? And erm, I was telling my mum and dad about that, No, everyone was bringing it back, it was, Ben from bringing it back to it. And Claire did, and so did Charlotte, it was really oh. I I told my mum and dad about that on Sunday, that she's got a leg waxing machine. I said she had been trained properly, I was telling them just basically about Claire in general and just about the good of erm, things like things you like to talk about, and erm, so I just, I said, they cried poverty, I said, but you know, one minute she's driving her old banger, and the next minute she's got a K reg and outside the , And then I said, then she'd been bought a a hundred pound of leg waxing machine. Does it look good on. I hope She shares it with her mum. I don't think her mum uses it very much. 'Cos I imagine it to be really sort erm, medieval Hi. Hi yeah. really, really old. I don't know, I I d , they're very expensive, I should imagine. I wouldn't bother with one. Hi yeah. Have you seem them, then. Yeah. How are you? Fine. No. Arr. What is that? not the only one. That's nice. You got your tickets? Mm. Oh, that was quick So you've got to flog another one to someone. No, no, no, Kerry's coming, erm, Oh, that's good. she's in Northampton, she's Oh, right, that's good. And she said she'd come. I've just phoned her up just to tell her. Jolly gee. I'm gonna see on Thursday, Are you? afternoon. How much did it come to? Only five fifty, I think. Oh, really. Yeah. What is it? It's called Two Gentlemen of Veronna? Ohh. I don't know what it's about. I think, Is it good? Mm. It's meant to be really funny, Yeah. and it's meant to be a really good production. Is that the R S C? Mm. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Is it in the pit, or is it in the the theatre? I don't where it is, er Nicole just s said, do you want to come, and I said, oh yeah okay, it's only gonna cost a fiver. Yeah. lot of things, if they weren't erm, we're doing theatre and drama next term. Oh, right. so. Actually, I I want, don't know whether you want interested in coming, I'm not sure whether I wanna go, but either next week, it'll have to be next week, 'cos I think after I won't be here, I'm going home. There is a play showing at erm, The Orange Tree, it's by Faye Weldon. I don't know whether you Oh, yeah. She wrote, The Love and Lives of the She Devil, and she's written it, she wrote it especially for The Orange Tree Theatre about ten years ago, and now she's re-doing it, It's already recording, yeah. Now she's re-written it, and er, it's gonna be shown there, and it's only, seats gonna be about a fiver, if you go, er in the afternoons. If you were going. Mm. Where's that? The Orange Tree erm, Theatre. There's a play on by, it's called Mr Director. It's on by Faye, it's written by Faye Weldon. Oh. And erm, I want to go and see it Well, I'll go on my own, if need be. I'm just asking if anyone's interested Yeah, I'll go. I thought about going on Monday. Erm, the twenty-sixth, I think. Let's see if I go home, yet. Yeah, well, I I I might, it might not be definite, but I think they want to go and see it before it goes on, and it's only a fiver, and I'd really like to see it. How, how are those things made. It's got erm, it's with the same Sheba, Mm. Erm, I just went upstairs, to see if I've got a blank tape, and I haven't got a blank tape. How did er T V go this morning? Excellent. Yeah, what was you doing to him, Camera C. So was I, I was doing camera two. Excellent. It's brilliant, innit. Really, really enjoying it. Oh, that was erm. Turn it up. Oh it's not fair No, I love th , erm the acting was excellent this morning. Was it, oh good. Have you managed to get lots of volunteers to do your outing with Mary and Fiona. well,sort of, erm. nurses, yeah are you doing the same things. Yeah, the same thing. Erm, 'cos I I didn't put an at all, and like the three blokes, there were only three lads and us anyway. So, so they had to do it. What, that's a bit out of order, innit, poor sods. They sort of went mm alright. Yeah. So they did it, and erm Is it a play? Yeah, we did Yeah, we had to call it, Lear's Lily Lily And, her nurse. And I just kept quiet. And erm, I just sat there and thought, I'm not doing it, Yeah, if they ask me, I'm not doing it, I'm sorry. And erm, And I really like, really work psyched myself up for it. And who did it in the end, who's doing it? Erm, Alice said she would do Lily, So you had to ask actual Oh, yeah. erm, and Martin and Den had already volunteered to be in it, Yeah. and then, David, was so- sort of bludgeoned into doing it. oh. David Brush. David Brush, and we we're still wa we're waiting on a Lily, so I think we might be asking Naomi to do our Lily for u I mean nurse er, nurse for us, 'cos we haven't got a nurse. Well, there's so part, you know, what I thought, I really would like to do to camera, and I was a bit, thought, well, everyone's gonna want to do camera so That's what I thought, and nobody wants to do it. Nobody wants, no, and I I started our first one, and I said I would, normally I I put my hand up, 'cos I wanted to direct. I'll do it . Yeah, and erm,yeah. quite nice as well actually, because there's not that many shots, and there's a nice break between all of them, isn't there. Yeah, and there nice easy shots, really. Yeah. Yeah, and erm, Sounds cools, doesn't it. I wish I could have a go. It is really I loved it, I was really enjoying it. I thought, yeah, this is what I wanna do. Have you got erm, you know you have the screen, and the monitor screen, have you got s , you know like they have on T V, the the writing that comes on, sort of, like a telephone number comes on the bottom of it, is it, have you got that, special things like that. Yes, you can do that. What, what, You can do, you can put you can put like credits up and you can put, you could put Mm. a telephone number up, couldn't you? It's just superimposed on the bottom. At the bottom of it, yeah. It's amazing what they can do, innit. In a way, I wish I was doi I wish I could equal acting on T V. Do you? I really liked I liked to do T V, I'd like to do camera work. Yeah. Would you have to go to university. Yeah. or just six weeks. No, it's for, it carries on till the end of semester one. What's art and techniques, then? Living theatre. The living theatre takes up, it comes up in the living theatre. The living theatre, yeah. whatever it is And do we then stop our majors or what? I would imagine so, yeah, I think, then you pick them up in year three if you want to. Which meant if I did it in year three, which I'd liked to, then you'd obviously equal or went into drama.

Must be what. oh dear, they getting him christened already. Oh dear. No, I mean the traditional Isn't it horrible when you don't know what to pay for things. Mm. How is it. Your dad. Well, it must be pretty soon. They wouldn't have done Which erm, is being challenged, or would like to be challenged by the U K including European Court of Justice erm, and that will be heard in the timescale that these things take place. If it were to be erm, not annulled is it likely that the directive would affected from something like ninety, late nineteen-ninety-six. Paragraph four gives you this summary of the main provisions of this directive, and there they are, for your consideration or observation. Appendix B is rather one earlier in the process where the European Community have produced a green paper, on European Social Policy, which will have impact upon employment legislation later on in the process. This green paper is capable of being commented on, by this sub-committee through, our normal channel would be the A C C. It doesn't contain a lot of detail, it is a matter of principle, and er, hopes and aspirations. Where we think and I mentioned this in the conclusion, and indeed, in the recommendation, where we think as officers it rather falls short, is that, although it does mention in the text, equal opportunities in all our er, activities as we would understand it here. It fails to put forward any options for accept for erm, equal rights, for disability or race, and we think this is an omission, and if it were your intention to write a response, we would want to include that point in the response we make. Thank you, Chris. Can we look at Appendix A, first. The recommendation is simply that it be noted and I wondered if anybody wanted to make a contribution, or ask any questions, put anything forward, on Appendix A. Councillor Yes, thank you, Chairman. I would, I would hope that as erm, as a committee we can support all these objectives, er, it does give me some cause for concern, that our own government is objecting to these provisions. Erm, just to comment on, for example, maximum average erm, hourly week, forty-eight hours. Erm, only the other day in the Transportation Department we were talking about drivers hours and er, it's obvious implication there on road safety where the government are trying to relax the provisions, for what's the European committee are trying to tighten them up. And er, we see on the media, very often, the problems faced by doctors in hospitals working eighty hours. Once again a proper scandalous situation, that we we should be working to er relieve, but doesn't seem to be the way that the government's moving. I hope we can support this one. Thank you. Councillor Er, yes, Mr Chairman. It night-shift not to exceed eight hours. Quite a number of people on of twelve. Er, how's it going to affect them, they're quite happy to do it, and er. There won't be a deregulation, of course. Hang on, Jim,Ji Ji , I'll write your name down, all right. Right, hang on, right. Carry on. you see people of priority, that deliver employment, Mr Chairman. Whether they go on late at night, or, hair cut the next morning, it's not, it's not to the wall, but er, this would appear to cut right across the board. That they aren't going to be allowed to do that. Which means some changing at night, or doing a bit with the night, or other one. Right. How, how, how does that fit in to Right. That's that's part of, of presumably, one of the objections from the U K Government, erm, that essentially, it's saying that that these arguments can't be, justified on health and safety grounds and that that the approach, de-regulation and freedom in the market to al allow people to do what they want to do, which is the fact that they, if they want to work twelve hours, then presumably the Government and yourself are supporting that that freedom. On the other hand, one can argue that it's not about, necessarily, what individuals want to do, it's about providing a framework that is good in health and safety terms. Well, well, this this is what I'm getting at, Mr Chairman, Mr Chairman. Er quite a few, I know, in security work, they prepared to go on not later than eight o'clock at night. So they can stay on normally, in some part of the year it is dark, but yet there's other people around and about, and they get in situ before very late, so the twelve and twelve suits them, and it's better for health and safety, and erm, in other , Mr Chairman. Regulation tends, is intending Is what they want to do. Regulation is intended to protect everybody's interest. Councillor erm, I'm glad you said that, Chairman,I was I was just thinking erm, cut out the but, regarding on Equal Opportunities, erm, Policies, as we've been discussing already, I would have thought housewives would have been delighted to have conservative hours rest presumably I just thought I was The right contribution helps our meetings. Councillor Er, thank you, Chairman. Well, I give a vote that erm, because certainly not everybody's aware that er, this er Service director is merely a way to get round to payments that different people have opt out of the social chapter. Well, what people forget is that, if you put employers in a straight-jacket, the people who suffer first, are the employees, which as you appreciate will not take on the future. One of the reasons why er Kenneth has a respectable crippling this country, is because there is more flexibility over there to this country. advice is taking people off, with, in the knowledge that they will not necessarily, er, er, er put themselves in a straight-jacket. Er, we keep meaning look at certain things report a eight hour week, including overtime, have a record period of four months and then the filing industry take it away, the work is seasonal. That's the of con of considerable concern, and it will mean possibly that faith er farm workers who rely on overtime to increase it's wages will will suffer as a result. So I do hope er that we that we do not support this, er, we've got to remember, it's not, Europe, is not the end all and be all of the world, there is a there is a Far East out there, there's the Japans of the world, the Koreans. Their employee costs are much lower than ours, their social costs are much lower than ours and in and in the real world, we have to compete with them, and the boiling point will come from being competitive, supplying goods and services at a cost that the other countries will not by putting themselves in straight-jackets. Thanks. Councillor Oh yes, I've come to er just ask the advice on the officers on the Appendix A Six er, negotiations., i.e. flexibility clauses for certain circumstances, for certain mistakes. flexibility er in implementation, and I think that that is the necessary part of it. But what, I think we do need to have is quite a a a a a we've not a no solution body who would agree with me, er you know, some of the things that have gone on within the er er agricultural industry in terms of gang masters, which is if if surely if if if we had been more clearly defined if would enforce probably the whole industry into disrepute, and I feel that we do need a a a a a a a framework, with a with a supply into Europe, because in the end we will not just be competing against other European countries we will be competing against the third world and some producers that are producing very different situations, so, I I think er, and and I'm concerned that it is the, it is that delegation, and it is the interpretation that our own government will put on it, because there's been so much mythology surrounding Europe. I went to the er conference that we had at Stokewatchford, which together with er, John, er my Vice Chairman er on Europe, the other week, and there is so much mythology, er, that has been dispensed by people who are half-hearted towards Europe or got a vested interest in no has not been committed to Europe, and and they use this, and in fact the classic example was, that, one of our own Lincolnshire M P's claimed that he had saved , Lincolnshire's from the ravages of Europe. absolute nonsense and he took an accolade for that, when in fact, it was never under any threat from European legislation, it was our own British Food Act, and that, our own interpretation of European war, that has brought the threat to us. So I think that there's, I welcome, you know, the Social Chapter on that basis, but it does clearly say, and prescribe, er something that can only be universally applied, and if there are, there is need, there is need, er there is scope for that, with delegation through particular industries, particular circumstances. Thank you,thank you. Councillor and then Councillor and then we can take the recommendation. First of all, Councillor comments,erm, you know, there seems to be this this er conservative mentality, that is let's drive all our working conditions down to the level of the competition, which means, you know, we would have a a mining industry if we were prepared to put children in, like that do in Columbia. Now, now I, now I, personal arguments has always been that we raise people's standards, out there, throughout the world. Not not, bring people down to the worst conditions that we can find in the world to be competitive. This is, it it's not the attitude that we need to be taking, and there's no where else we'd be supporting in, in in this, er, opposition to this particular European Council of Directive. It, I mean, it disappoints me that we are the country in Europe that that's always dragged, kicking and screaming to the table, to discuss things like this, which are the benefit of the majority of the people in the in the European Community. It's just those few, committed capitalists that see profits as the only, the only motive to be on this earth, that seem to be, was was they seem to have the influence in this in this country, and and like er, I'm I'm hoping that this er, er British Government objection to the Court of Justice does fail, as as is er suggested it may do, erm, and let's let's hope it does, and let's hope that we get this er, implemented. Thank you, thank you. Councillor Yes, er thank you Chair. I can't see anyone can disagree with the objection Oh you can, I mean, we've just heard some. Yes, well probably, it's time for me to try and change his mind. Er, because er, we, do we want the rest of the world to follow us, not for us to follow the rest of the world. And he mentioned about both competing with China and er er the Third World Countries. Very recently, not so long ago, I saw on programme on India, in in one of the sweat-shops, you saw young children, boys and girls about twelve years old, on their hands and knees making matches, and a man walking down the centre with a stick. That was, that's the reality of cheap imports from the Third World. Now, the er, whilst we cannot expect them to adopt say our ideals, because we are er, you know, we're probably more modernised in lots of ways, but we can set a standard which they work towards, and er, he mentioned about the fact that people er, the unemployment's coming down a lot with the jobs, they're just part-time jobs, and they're very cheap paid jobs, and very er bad conditions for a lot of people as far as health and safety goes. Because we mustn't miss the point, it does say, it's er, the government is objecting be on the grounds of health and safety. Now this is leading towards that, to make people work too long, especially part-time jobs, come from one to another. They could be very tired, we've seen er, er the consequences of that and er, a lot of er these accidents happening on er, with the coaches and one thing and another. Because people have done one job, during the day, and then having to go on to another job at night, and make no mistake, that, you know, this is the sort of legislation that we need, to protect us, the public from what, you know, the consequences of somebody working Tape number three in conversation with Mr John . You were mentioning the the old coffin route from . Starting at , you said. Starting at a hundred and ninety. On the one inch, map. Hundred and ninety. Up by that loch. Now that's near Loch . That's it. Watch me now. Ah can you mark it in maybe? That's it. I see, up to the Glen . That's right, but it doesn't go as far as the Glen , Right. it keeps this side of the Glen , To the side. And then in like that. Mhm. Follow me? Yes. I'll just have a shot at pencilling that in. Yes it's a very Its near it anyway. a windy track. It's a, oh yes a windy track. Not the easiest ways. The people who undertook such a It's more or less the hard ground. Aha, the ground very much ? And there was and there was cairns where they used to rest the the coffin, cairns here and there along the route. Was there? Where they used to rest the the coffin for a m m and have a dram and a piece of cheese or some biscuits. I'd read about, I read erm read in erm some paper or other not so very long ago, about erm a funeral and the that was going along the road of course,and they came to a to a erm hotel and they were och, they were going for miles and miles and miles and they went into this hotel and the they party the funeral party went into the hotel and had a good few drinks and they were well away when they came out and they they they went away without the coffin, for two miles, two miles before they discovered that they didn't have the coffin. They had to go back ag go back again for the coffin. The people who undertook er following that route, through such a an entanglement of lochans and turns, would have had to have know their directions very well otherwise Yeah. they could have been lost quite easily. And do you know think that these cairns possibly were there to guide them as mu as much as anything? Oh well they they knew the road, these men knew knew the road very well, and er they knew the Area. area, they could tell by the hills, they could tell the way. I came from m my from , across the hill with my father when I was sixteen, at night. At night? At night. But it was a lovely moonlit night and we didn't leave , it was about eight o'clock at night when we left . We were at at there, and I went with er with my father er on a Friday and we came back that night. Now that must be a good, what would you say, seven miles at least in one direction? Well it it would be something like that,so something like At least. seven miles. Easily. And Well it would, it was two good hours, to walk across the erm . Take you two hours anyway. That was well it's wasn't quite a mile and a quarter. And this was just a beaten track? Oh just a beaten track. Whereas the other one in Glen was an actual made track? Well I'll tell you a good story about that, to s , to let you see that it was a well beaten track. And it was just the the the people were often walking along this track, anyway there was a man,there was erm,was a, there was a man and a woman walked over to and walked back again at night, well in the the even , evening anyway. And the woman lost her brooch on the way back and she saw this man next morning, he was a policeman in , and he he was too fond of the drink,a and he he was on, he was a railway policeman, and he fell onto the rails, when the train was coming, nobody knows how he how he how he er he lost one arm er about there and the other one about there, both arms but he he survived it. Nobody knows how he he how the how his head wasn't bashed. But anyway this woman that lost the brooch, she me she saw this man, without the hands going across the hill to , she asked him where he was going, and he said, I'm going to to , across the hill. Are you coming? No, she said, I've been there yesterday, but er I lost a brooch, and I wish you would be on the look out for it. Did you keep the track all the way? he said. Yes, all the way. Anyway this man without the arms, he went to and he had er he had er a pocket outside his jacket here, and he he erm got the brooch and he called on the at the house where this woman was and he says, Put your hand into that pocket, he said, and she puts her hand in, Oh, she say, she says, You've got the brooch. Yeah, yeah, he says, I think that'll be yours. But how did the, what was puzzling a lot of people how did he manage to get it off the ground and into his pocket. By his teeth? He must he must erm stooped down on his knees and caught it in his mouth and and got it into his pocket some way or another. Mm, but both these people came from ? Yes, both of them. And that's a, an incredible tale. It is, right enough . Because it it really bears out what you were saying that the there was a track which Well it it erm, it shows you that there was a track. Because no one could have found that brooch if it had just been a wilderness. No, no, no, no. If you had been any any where else on the hill you'd have, wouldn't have a chance cos you couldn't, you couldn't follow the track that they they di they followed the day before. And that was the lady's son involved who told you this? That's right. Roughly when do you think it happened, that incident with the brooch? Pardon? When in time did it occur? That's right. Aha, can you put a date on it though? Was it the, before the Great War, during the Oh yes I think so. Think before the I think it as before the War but I'm not quite sure mind either, could have been after the War. That's the first War? I know the lady, oh yes first War, I know the lady was going to after the War, the man could have been. Very possible. Do you have any reminiscences of the the Great War and the way it affected , were many of the men called up to to serve from the area? Well all the young they were, they were either called up or they vol volunteered. And did you see vessels in the area, because you yourself would be too young were you not? N well I was I was erm I would have been called up in another two months after the War was over, if the War had continued I would have been eighteen in in that in the following January. Do you recall seeing any ships that were involved in the War coming by,? Well the the some of the soldiers and sailors used to walk from all the way home to or or . The snow was that heavy that no traffic, nothing could move. They were walking Er about all that distance . And there weren't really proper roads? The road the roads were there alright but they were Snowed. covered over with sn with a few feet of snow. There was no snow ploughs in those days, it was all hand cut if they were cutting drifts it was manual labour. Spade? Spade. Were you badly affect in the, by winters? Well we had we had a lot of snow in those days, far more than than there's been since then. The seasons seem to have changed. Now, how did these people you mentioned before make this track at , it was a better made track, you said it wasn't just a beaten Well from inside the inside the forest fence Aha. it's there it started and the rest of it was all a beaten track like what was going to . If, so from the the with Loch down towards it was a beaten track? That's right. But from the towards it was a proper track? That's right, proper track. Now how did they in those days make the the track? Well there'd be be a squad of men working there, paid by the estate. And use any materials that were found near by . And they they wouldn't be getting the money they're getting today. Aha. If they they they would, if there was a gaffer there he would be getting a shilling a day and the labourers would be getting ninepence or something,n ninepence a day. and it would be hard work too. Perhaps perhaps a pound or two of . These were the conditions then. That's how they had so much money, all these landlords in those days. There were no taxing. And any servants they had were low low were very lowly paid. I'll tell you a story about erm erm a girl from , she was on service in with erm Sir John , Sir John and Lady . There was a lodge there in in the in the village. And this day Lady had some letters to post in the early morning, she wanted them away, on the mails in the early morning. And she told this maid to go with the letters to post them. And it was going, but she doing something and she the Lady seen her going through a corridor and she said to her, Run Annie run. No my lady I never run for d anybody and I'm not going to run for you. She was a good maid though. and she didn't get the sack. Well good evening and welcome to Central Weekend, our audience come from Birmingham. Thank you. We begin with the government agency which threatens to become poll tax. When the child support agency was set up it was greeted with almost universal approval, making runaway dads pay seemed the order of the day. But an avalanche of complaints has almost overwhelmed the C S A and it comes from dads already paying out agreed sums for their kids. So what's gone wrong? Tony you've been married before, you have three children, you know want to marry Alaina there. What's stopping you? I was getting married till the C S A stepped in. Now I can't afford to get married. I can't afford to work and I can't afford to see my children. What are you paying now for your children? Er thirty pound a week. How much do they want? Hundred and twelve. Thirty to a hundred and twelve. Yeah. In one swipe? Yeah. And you can't afford to get married? No. Alaina, how does it feel for you to be told by civil servants how to conduct your life? Well I actually rang them up to say, why why are you taking my wages into consideration, I didn't break up this marriage, I met him a long time afterwards an I was told by a C S A agent or clerk or whatever, that my wedding was nonessential spending. When I said I've got a wedding to pay for, they said to me, well can you think about cancelling it because it's nonessential spending, and I said Your wedding, hang on, your wedding was nonessential spending. You were told that? Yes I was. Nonessential spending. Mhm. Theresa Gorman, that's outrageous. A girl's wedding is nonessential spending. In my mind while you're talking is about these three children who presumably er this gentleman's wife was supposed to be looking after on thirty pounds a week. I think that's ridiculous. He didn't tell us how much money he earns and he didn't tell us how much money he gave his wife when he was married to her and was looking after his own children. That's the kind of information which I think is relevant, not whether he wishes to get married again, that is a separate issue. But has a clerk got the right to tell a couple that their wedding is nonessential spending? I rather think that they are concentrating on the main task which is to see that the children are properly provided for. Well but you What you want to do er what you want after that, including marrying again is a separate matter, his primary responsibility and I'm sure he would agree with this is to the wellbeing of those children Yes but the and that is what matters . L l l let Alaina respond er In saying that, at the end of the month if we do pay this amount of money, I only earn five hundred pounds a month, that's four hundred and forty eight pounds a month. Now like I said before, I didn't break up this marriage, so this is a witch hunt against people like myself, second wives, second partners. I can't even afford to have my own children. At the end of the month with our incomings and our outgoings we're going to be in debit of fifty seven pounds a month. And that doesn't include clothes or anything else. That is just the gas bill, Theresa the money tell me how tell me how to pay for my wedding. The agency's responsibility is to see that those children are properly paid for . No it's not, not it's not . Rubbish. And out of the money it's your Their responsibility is is to get five hundred and fifty million pounds, that's their responsibility. No no,bu but do Alright let me ask Lindsey. But you asked me, do you believe that your wife can look after children Ex-wife on thirty pounds? I pay thirty pounds Three children but I also I also buy school uniforms three children I also pay for school trips, I take them out every weekend, I give them pocket money Pocket money It costs me fifty five pounds But who do you think should pay to look after your children Pardon? if not yourself and your wife. Not on thirty pounds . I do look after them, I do look after them. What you're doing you're just penalizing a hundred a twelve pounds let let's get it right then. So this is the fifty per cent relationship. So that's a hundred and twelve he's expected to pay. Is she taking in a hundred and twelve somewhere? Is she? No. I'm earning it for her. I'm earning it for her, that's not fair. Let me ask Lindsey here, Lindsey how's your marriage going? What marriage? Well tell me about it. It's it's not worth a marriage no more because the C S A and because of people like them sat there that think they know it all. Well tell us erm tell us about the payment and tell us what's happening to you and what you're gonna have to do. Well my husband'll have to leave so I'll claim income support and be as well off as his ex-wife. And if he can't manage then then it's up to him what he does. So my marriage has fallen apart because of these people sat here that think they know everything. own kids have grown up so it doesn't matter to them,just live back in days and make you spend your money the way they tell you and live how you they tell you. Are you two talking about splitting up? Yeah. There's no other choice . Or at least dissolving the marriage? Well th we'll have to split up legally and then we'll still carry on seeing one another. But he we'll have to live apart, we'll have to make us try and make our marriage work by living apart. Is it really as dramatic as that? It is. Because what they left me, I cannot look after my wife and support my other two kids. Plus I can't buy my kids t the first wife, I can't buy them stuff now. Christmas presents Sir Ivan, is this is this sort of thing defensible? Well it's very sad when people have unhappy relationships as we've had described to us. I quite agree. But it wasn't But why should, why should millions Everything was okay till this happened this C S A why should millions of taxpayers pay for your happiness? Why should they have to pay We pay our taxes as well Why should millions of taxpayers pay for your pay rise ? for for your wedding? Yeah. Why should the millions of taxpayers This gentleman thinks that he can bring up a child on a ten pounds a week, it's nonsense . lot of money you can bring them on to bring up. Everybody thought he must think first about the bringing up of the children That's all I think about and this couple over there must think first about the children What about my children ? There is no reason why I or anybody else as taxpayers should pay five thousand million pounds that's every family in this country about three hundred pounds a year for lone parents who are not looking af being pa having the parents the father looking That's just rubbish after the children. We're gonna have far more lone parents Ex excuse me Hang on for a second please. One minute. Everybody thought Sir Ivan, that's where the disgrace is, that's where the disgrace is Sir Ivan please. Nobody the Conservative we government that's implementing this Child Support Act. That's right There's nothing wrong with the Child Support Act . Everybody thought Look can we do one show here we're doing two at the moment? Let's just do one. Sir Ivan. Everybody thought, please everybody thought Is the programme is f to hear you or to hear me? You asked me a question I gave an answer. It would be very it would be very considerate if you did try and answer a little bit briefer alright? a moment or two to answer a question not just five seconds Well it's only half an hour everybody thought that this agency was for runaway dads. Exactly. It appears that the dads who are already paying are the one's who are paying and nobody seems to chasing after the others. Now that's not true. Six per cent are errant fathers. There are te Six per cent are errant fathers. Th Now you tell me how that can be fair. Well let him answer the question. There are two kinds of non-payers. There are those who haven't been found and they are being chased and more of them will be chased Rubbish. two and a half thousand of them were chased and found last month alone so there are something like twenty thousand fathers who were errant and haven't been chased And what about the other eighty thousand who are paying it and you're making them pay more? And then there are thousands of other fathers who are paying ten pounds like this gentleman for a child which costs thirty or forty pounds a week to bring up. Now I hope that everybody here who has has a relationship, a marital relationship is happy . If it costs thirty or forty pounds why do you only fifteen pounds on income support for them? But they can't expect me Could you answer the question ? or the tens of millions of other other taxpayers Can I ask you please Andrew, how well has he worked out for you? It isn't working out for me, I've been told I've gotta increase my payments to a hundred and one pounds fifty two a week for my two children from my previous marriage, and I've been told by Social Security that the hundred and one pound fifty two a week will take my ex-wife and her husband off income support, so I will be keeping her family and their child. Not just my children. You will be keeping your children I would not. No that's not true. No that is rubbish. I have been told by Social Security would let me er excuse me talking to me. Just wait your Child Support Agency does not help does not help husbands. It helps children. turn, right? I was told a hundred and one pound fifty two would be to keep my two children, my ex-wife, her husband and their child, by a Social Security expert. Well they were wrong. That is not . Well they were not wrong. Because they told me that the assessment will be made by the Child Support Agency who would then pass it over to the Income Support Agency who would then take them off Income Support. I'm going to Councillor Lines here who's a Conservative Councillor, hang on Theresa, we have a Conservative Councillor let him answer the question. Er John it looks less defendable every time every time a real person opens their mouths John it becomes less and less defendable? Well who are the ones that are moaning and groaning about it? The ones that are ac actually having to pay for their children. They're not my children, they're their children . What a load of rubbish. Now the Chi the Child Support Agency is now can I speak please? talking rubbish The Child Support Agency is probably one of the few agency organizations within this country that actually that don't know what they're doing tells people what their responsibilities are, not just what their rights are. And I am not willing and the majority of the people are no in this country are not willing to pay for other people's children Well why don't I'm sorry about the individual circumstances , I don't know about the individual circumstances No you never and my children who go to work now have grown up, I've brought them up, I don't want them paying for someone else's children. Sitting in front of you is a gentleman who was paying what, about a hundred pound a week sir? Er a hundred pound a week or a month, a hundred pound a month. It's almost quadrupled to three hundred and fifty a month. That's right. How are you coping with that? Er I can't. Basically I'm er going to lose my job because I can't afford to go there. Erm this is gonna cost this government a fortune because I am a Crown officer, I'm a Crown prosecutor . How how many children? Two by my first marriage. Erm that er that marriage failed like most of these these have, erm what I want to know is er why, when I was disposed of as you like as a useless article, why I am suddenly called upon by this government to be one hundred per cent, not fifty per cent responsible, but one hundred per cent responsible, not only for my children which I'm quite happy to do, but one hundred per cent responsible to keep my wife off of benefit and one hundred per cent responsible if she should ever want one,t for her partner. This is happening in over ten per cent of all the cases that are coming up before your agency or your government's agency, whereby a working parent so-called absent according to you, is supporting not only his children, his ex-wife, or his e if it's if it's the husband supporting Mm. the other way round, supporting an ex-wife and supporting a partner th as well. Just the same as Andrew here is doing. That's a fact. It actually sounds, it actually sounds can I put this to you, it sounds less like a Child Support Agency and more like a Treasury support agency every day doesn't it ? Theresa. You can get a cheap clap for a remark like that. I'd like to hear what the mothers I would like to hear Thank you Mr , thank you I would like to hear thank you for the cheap put-down but would you answer the question ? I would but I would like to hear from some of the women the mothers who have been struggling to raise children with relatively small amounts of money, whilst the husband and they still are has having enough opportunity to go off and make a second marriage, which I don't deny them but they must accept their responsibilities. All the But the point is what are you gonna do when you get ten million shouting, in this country, in this country Hey one at a time, one at a time I want to go to Audrey Wise in a second. seventy per cent of more of fathers whose marriages broke up were not supporting their children. Either at all or Yeah well you should be chasing adequately and that is what the agency was set up to do to correct that situation. Please may I go to Audrey Wise. Audrey Wise shouldn't fathers pay their It's essential that parents are responsible. share? Let's pick out what's been said by our Conservative M Ps. Shouldn't fathers pay their share and not exc er expect the state to provide for their children? That's what's being said. Well yes, fathers should sh er shoulder their responsibility, but don't forget No clap for that . children children are also of concern to all of us they're not just the children of the parents, we depend on those children in our old age, who will nurse us, who will look after us, it's wrong to p behave as if children are simply the personal possession of the parents, personal possession of the parents Responsibility my dear, responsibility responsibility and if they were concerned about the children , the children would get the benefit, the Income Support is removed pound for pound, the women who bring up their children in poverty still bring up their children in poverty. And so hear hear so all they're doing is adding more families living in poverty . Quite right, quite right . Exactly. I believe, I believe in two parent families, there's nobody in my family that's in this situation. But we're lucky. Are they to make er second marriages a crime? They're getting fined more for marrying again er than they would if they'd committed a crime. And not to benefit the first marriage and not to benefit any of the children. Theresa. Can't can't we hear from some of the women in this audience who have benefited from this system? Well let's go to Kate. balanced view? Kate you have benefited haven't you? Yes my h my ex-husband was paying maintenance through a court order and his maintenance payments have increased er enormously under the Child Support Agency, the reason being erm under the old court system all his debts were taken into account. Every time we went to court he would erm take out a new loan, he took out a loan to take his wife to Bermuda, that was taken into account. He took out a life insurance policy for a hundred and twelve pounds three weeks before the last court appearance. I never had any money erm that would help me to get off benefit, I was caught in the benefit trap and now I've been able to get a part time job, my husba ex-husband's paying a reasonable amount and my children are better off. I'm better off. Everyone's saying How's your husband living? And how is your husband how is your husband coping with all that? Well I don't know really his children by his second wife, the ones that I would like to have, this lady would like to have, what happening to them ? Can I say please Why not let the lady answer ? L let her answer. My ex-husband if he can afford holidays in Bermuda I'm sure he can afford children. He's well paid. My children came second. I wish I wish I could afford a holiday in Bermuda. Yes well my husband . Scotland would do me . Let me ask er let me ask Robert over here now Robert, er I see here it tells me that you were separated from Alison, Alison your first wife, er let me get this microphone right, you were separated from your first wife, this is your second wife, you were separated from your first wife er and I understand it was a clean break, it was a clean break with a court settlement? Yes I did. So what's happened now with the C S A? Well the C S A have raised my er maintenance er from sixty seven pounds a month for one child to two hundred and eight pounds a month now. Erm I I I signed over I signed over a number of thousands of pounds erm n nine years ago, eight or nine years ago with regard to the matrimonial home which Alison still lives in with my son Ben today. That suited her at the time, it suited the law courts at the time who were the the adjudicators in the case. It also suited me. I started then from floor level. From nothing. Nothing, absolutely nothing. And I met my wife, present wife three months afterwards and we have worked damned hard to raise a family and a and a good family basis for two lovely children . Now le let me ask Alison And you you people are destroying that situation by taking away from us true family values. you're not only hurting me and my present wife and my two children, you are also hurting my ex-wife and my son. Well let me go to your ex-wife, Alison there was an amicable court settlement? Oh yes. Yes. Why did you change it? I didn't. I didn't. What happened I I had a booklet from the D S S as I get an Income Support benefit You're on Income Support are you ? Yes I am Yes. yes. Her choice, not mine. Her choice, we're nine years' on now. let it go. Erm I was sent a booklet from the D S S asking for various financial details, with the instructions that if I didn't complete the booklet and send it back to them to the D S S, my benefits would stop. So obviously I sent it back pretty quickly. The next I heard was when I had a complete breakdown of Robert and Janet's income erm with the breakdown of how a new settlement was was brought about . Yes. My argument is yes the maintenance has been increased, my Income Support hasn't been increased by a penny And my son has received none of the two hundred and eight nothing pounds that I'm pay . He doesn't even receive any of the sixty seven pounds that I'm paying . So so the money you're paying is not going to your son, it's going to the Treasury is that right ? I'm here, the money you're paying is going to the Treasury, not to your son? Absolutely yes. Theresa just how do we justify that and then I want to hear from a lawyer about this. Theresa. Because you see the Treasury it is who actually tries to see that other people don't have to pay for someone else's responsibilities if they're not justified. If this gentleman, if this gentleman has children which he has by his first wife, in my view and in the view of the great majority of people in this country I don't think it's the majority, you're wrong there . he should accept the responsibility for the cost of raising them. If his first wife cannot afford to live without benefit support from the rest of us, which is what state benefit is, the government has no money, it takes money out of other families who are struggling to bring their children up to give it to you. But your husband can afford to help you some more for the benefit agency . Theresa, let me go that's the whole point Theresa I've got commitments now, I've got commitments Russell, Russell we've had a good run. I want to go across to Susan , how can court decisions be overturned like this? Well they can. The Child Support er Act says that when a Child Support Assessment is carried out it supersedes an existing court order. Now I think that is a basic injustice that I'd like to hear you two address. Mm. What do you say to the fathers, and I have had dozens from up and down the country contacting me, what do you say to the fathers like that chap over there in th in the front row, who has handed over sometimes tens of thousands of pounds, he's done his bit, he's had it rubber stamped by the court, he's gone ahead in good faith and made his his his future, and then the Child Support Agency comes along and just without so much as a by your leave pulls the rug. Don't you think that's a basic injustice ? I can say that er that gentleman has been misled by his lawyers who called the arrangement who called the arrangement a clean break . But nine years ago they didn't know. But don't you think it would be fair Now a spouse can make a clean break agreement with a spouse, Yeah. er and that agreement is to look after the spouse, there is never and there has never been in our law, and there isn't now, a clean break as far as children are concerned. But don't you think it would be fair As children grow up they they become more expensive, as children as children Don't you think it would be fair the costs which the father has to pay rise and our law says that Yeah. there is no clean break as far as children are concerned. But don't you think it would be fair And for anybody to have told that gentleman that it was a clean break agreement No and that would look after children for ever Le let Susan come in is nonsense. I don't see why Excuse me Right well let's not do a filibuster let I le let Susan come in. Don't you think it would You were asking a question Yes I know but you we Susan please. Don't you think it would be fair if the assessment which the Child Support Agency carries out, took into account at the very least the fact that capital settlements have been made. Don't you think that they should at least nod in the direction ? N not at all, because the capital settlement Not at all? is nothing to do with the child. Its a capital settlement, it's an arrangement with the spouse. No Of course it is, it puts a roof over the child's head. not at all. What do you mean not at all of course it does . And if that gentleman wants to go off and have and and marry again and raise more children he should still not leave his What do you mean it's s wha what do you mean not at all? first wife on Income Support for tax payers Aren't there other way some of whom who are not very wealthy people, there are an awful lot of taxpayers who Thanks to you would like some of the benefits It We have a man, we have a man in the audience and they've got no right to do it we have a man in the audience, Gary, where are you Gary, give me a wave, Gary was actually told to default on his mortgage and pay up. Default on his mortgage, he was told that by an officer. That's right. Yeah. Th they told me to default on the mortgage that I'm paying for the property that my wife lives in, because the assessment doesn't take into account that I That's right. already pay four hundred pounds a month to my wife Yes you only g they expect me to pay another three hundred pounds a month out of seven hundred and twenty pounds net income, leaving me with twenty pounds a month to live on . You only get an allowance for the house you're living in. Audrey can I ask you Audrey can I can I just ask you to make this point about this. Why on earth should people here who do not have families pay for people who do have families? Because children are the future for all of us. And it's and it's Well then shouldn't fathers think about it before they produce the children ? You would think you would think from this that Tory MPs were all paragons of virtue. And they're not, they're not But the point is what we're being told is effectively that only the rich can have second marriages, that's what this Child Support Act brings about. Only the rich not the poor, they're increasing poverty and if it was anything to do with children and if it was reasonable, they would take into account things like the water rates, legal aid, cost of access. I can tell you of er of a man who's been told that he should see his children less Mm. because he won't be able to afford the access so the Child Support Officer said see them less . They don't want you to see your children . Theresa are we not are we not missing out with this legislation are we not missing out on a little thing called compassion? You see if you're Let her talk. if you're a member of parliament Let her talk. the kind of people that come to my surgery are genuinely and almost entirely women who are struggling to keep their children That's right because their husbands have made these settlements, often at very emotional times when the women were not really in a position to really make sure they and they come to MPs like me to try and find some way of helping themselves out of the dilemma. Usually what they come for is, can you have my children looked after right in some way so I can go to work. Yes why don't you Theresa, can I ask can I ask can I ask Susan Susan and that strain should not be put on them. Can we talk a little bit about numbers. Mm. How many cases do you as one barrister have to deal with at the moment? I have had dozens of people from up and down the country getting in touch with me. It's just astonishing. And that represents not one family but two family each one represents a number of children, the misery that this is causing absolutely immense. but the misery which stirred this act was also immense and it was quiet and covered up because these women had nowhere to turn to before and they struggled I think it would be I don't think there would be trouble Can we make, can we just please make make a final point. This was really sold to us. This was sold to us, please, this was sold to us on the basis that it was going to bring in the baddies and sort out the baddies, and we'd all live happily ever after. It was sold to us on a false premise. Mm. Because it's not the baddies we're getting at we're getting at a lot of the goodies and we're hurting them. Yes but you're getting at a you're going to get a lot of the baddies who've missed it, you are getting a lot of the baddies now, sh sh lot of the people who are complaining here are people who are complaining that their an assessment has been made which was very much lower than is necessary for bringing up children. This was an act of parliament, you'd never think twenty per cent so from Audrey Wise but it was an act of parliament which had the support the Labour Party as well because the purpose of it is is to help wives to help mothers Yes except you didn't, except parliament didn't see half of the effects of it Thatcher who have been receiving underpayments from their husbands when the courts maintenance agreements . Would you have the courtesy to let him finish. Sorry. And I agree with Theresa, all of my surgery cases in this matter have been from wives saying, I cannot live on the maintenance which my husband is not paying me I don't believe you, I don't believe you. he is breaking the court orders, I don't believe you. the amount of money I'm getting is inadequate, I'm not getting it made up in Income Support, please help. And that's why we brought in the Child Support Agency with the support of the Labour Party. You must be the only MP in the country that hasn't had fathers coming to you . Excuse me. Susan. Fascist. I think, I think the problem with this act in my view is that it would've been one thing to say to people, right from here on in, we're going to do it like this. But where the uproar has come from is from people who have thought that they had got binding court agreements. If you're gonna do something radical and change the way that we're going to look after children you've got to take the people with you. never had binding, never had binding court agreements because mothers could always go back to court and say this fifteen pounds isn't enough. I'm now having to to buy more uniform for my child and so there was never a binding court order . But don't you think that th don't you think that the fact that the father, I'm speaking don't you think that the fact that the father has made a capital settlement But Susan the people that that the people that are coming to you now that he's If we don't go one at a time nobody'll be heard. Now finish what you're saying. Don't you think that the fact that the father has made a capital settlement, that he has sometimes to travel to the other end of the country to see his child, don't you think that should be taken into account. Don't you think children Theresa, briefly, let her answer it Theresa briefly. need more than money? Hard cases do make bad law. But we had the situation where seventy per cent of not just fathers who were unemployed but fathers that were well off were not adequately and in some cases not supporting . That's an enforcement not an assessment. Seventy per cent of all women on their Theresa, the Prime Minister has promised own were not receiving support from their spouses. The Prime Minister has promised a review of this. The Prime Minister has promised a review . Yes, yes. Is it going to make a difference, is it going to change what is essentially not a particularly satisfactory law? Well I think what we want to do is to find out the truth from the hype and the emotion, that is what we want to establish and I'm sure we will correct it if there is any injustice . Can I just ask a question here? But all of the injustice until now has been with women inadequately supported and husbands and the inadequate levels of support and husbands who relied on the state to take over Can I just say something to you? responsibility . Let us see Theresa I'm going to have to stop you and I'm going to have stop you as well Sue and can I say that we're going to need to wait and see what the Prime Minister has to say. Can I thank you most sincerely, it's been a very emotive debate, a lot of people feel very strongly about this and of course they do, it affects their lives, their children, their existence, their relationships. And their pockets . But can I thank you all for taking part, thank you. Right well here are the phone calls, you'll be interested in these, er Ann from Birmingham says, my husband pays nothing but the Child Support Agency didn't want to know. Tony from Ladywood says the M Ps' pay rise should be classed as nonessential spending. Stewart from Tamworth says I'm on the dole and have to pay maintenance, Prince Charles should be doing the same. Mrs from Darlaston says, they are victimizing the men who are working erm need to chase those men who are doing nothing for their families. Paul from Tamworth says er I'm a single man looking after my children and I don't get a penny from my ex-wife. Stewart from Sparbrook says the C S A are men haters who try to get as much as possible out of them. Other ones here, an anonymous call from Birmingham, I have been beaten up weekly by my ex-husband because he's been told to pay more. And finally er a Shropshire caller says, if you have children then you should pay for them, not the state. So a range of views there. But still to come, should men wear wigs? Are they worth it? Can you spot the old Irish jigs a mile off? Should there, should men get hung up about their hair loss? Well here's one man who is very definitely erm upside down about the whole thing, if I can just er tip him over a little bit there, could you, no I'll try that one again will I it's er a a very delicate er gravitational exercise and this man, would you believe it, this man was er one of Britain's greatest ever Olympic athletes, gold medal winner for the U K, David Wilkie in the Montreal Olympic Games, ladies and gentlemen If I can er I can just sneak in he won some gold medal for Scotland as well but we'll just er But of course of course David what on earth are you doing? Well I'm hanging down like this to increase the circulation to my head saving in that Well that er But not saving to these that's if particular firms that that they want. that's if No. Mm. That is their own fault because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it Mm. they must be selling it Well they will do. them very cheap because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling No thanks. and it said about tin cans and aluminium and that and it was costing them less excuse me to use recycled you know er used aluminium Mm. and used steel cans and that it was costing them less to use that than it was to use Brand new stuff. yeah. Yeah. So, I mean to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but that my first thought is that they must be buying it very It's gotta be profitable they must be buying it very cheap then? Mm. Mm. So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it are selling it to them very cheap so it is their own fault! I think initially er It's only it's been cheaper to now has got a cost more in the initial Well it does stages until it's sort of, set up, until everyone is sort of you know geared into doing this kind of you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the goes there Well yes, because they're not and all the companies that are responsible for for re-using it and all the distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there you know, once that network is going then surely Oh yes! it's gotta be useful because instead of going you know from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being ever seen again it's going That's right! in a circle and, and surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up? And it's a, it's an ongoing thing Yeah! You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have three bins. Yeah. You have your paper you have your bottles you know alright initially as you say it take, it costs but To set it up it does , to set it up,yo you have you have, you'll have to have three, three what's his names? Three, three bin men to come and collect it. Mm. Or no, you have to have three containers. But they do it in Canada! Well this is what I'm saying! Yeah. But I mean Even even got one you see for plastic! but, but there well yo , you could have four, you could have as many as you like Mm. but I mean surely, in the long term Course! but that co idea he doesn't drink beer, so you can have his for Well no,but I mean like But that's the key word is the long term Ken! like you sell, you sell that back to them that that pays the man's wages that is doing it! Mm. Mm. But it's the short term isn't it, with them? They just thinking well we haven't got the machinery to cope with this! It's easier for us No the to buy the new raw material and process it Yeah I said and it ah Ah but but yeah, I know but the well this is the This is the way the government's gotta act now! Ah well, well this is it Well this is it it, it has to be done! They won't! Generated the This is the trouble It's a joke! this is the trouble with this country because it's has has I mean look at Germany! Yeah, but I mean they will make progress, I mean this colony And is would never Mm. advance! I mean that's why we lost our moto er motorcycle industry Yeah. it's why we've lost most of our industry because they won't, they won't invest in new machinery or mo , new methods! Modernisation. I mean they've Just won't look ahead! You see it's the same as they said on there we've had all these inventions and they get by our country. and they get, they get in this country and then they go and exploit them in another country! Mm. So where's the Computer's the finest example of that produced But in Manchester! Mm. This government says ooh we can't afford that, no, it's a it's a gimmick! The Yank says we will! Bingo! And look, this used to be We could of held them to ransom! one of the best education systems in the world! And I mean I know, it isn't now! won't be here now well you could sliding right I know! down the scale! Mm. We're terrible! We're way behind Germany, France you can only cut back Russia and prune back so much in the name of efficiency before sooner Well or later things su suffer! There was, there was a programme on Channel Four there to I was watching before I picked my book up and they had Conservative Labour bloke and the independent er Liberals and these were supposedly they have on on er Channel Four a a programme called Week in Politics anyway this night, this, tonight they were doing a a fu , they had a floating audience, supposedly a floating audience You mean, they were under water? flo ,fa floating vo er voters Oh! er until, until the end and they had a poll of er who who has been persuaded to vote for the three la , you know, what had they done to Oh they had to to say who they supported and vote for the three, that's right and there was one one put their hand up for he persuaded them that Ne , Neil Kinnock would be a good leader, that was it er so one put their hand up for him one put their hand up for Major and she had the cheek to say that that is only because I'm a Conservative! And it was supposed to be , if the audience was supposed to be voting and I mean but the quite the majority of them er put their hands up for Paddy Ashdown. Yeah he's a very persuasive character Well when and he wasn't on he wasn't on, but he he at the towards the end they gave the three of them thirty seconds to describe the go , you know, the qualities of of the Of a good leader. of of of er their leader Mm. and the one one for the Libs he only used twenty seconds, twenty two seconds! And he finished? And, you know he said I'm sure Paddy Ashdown would think that you could of found something else to use the other To say. eight seconds up ! But er but he ended up, you know as sure as they've asked er the something to say the show of hands, like he was er he was the one that the floating voters were Yeah. But I mean But only He, he looks a very persuasive kind of character doesn't he erm I mean he's, he's quite sort of erm well a nice person well he Yeah. seems to be! But er But you know Well see wha wha down there was a couple there in their leather jackets look, looked a cli couple you know, the boy and girl couple of yobbos! Looked a right couple of yobbos And er well what day is it like? Well he says er how could you vote for Kinnock he says because the press attacks him and he doesn't defend himself! But your dukes up Neil! You know! Yeah, well And this is the mentality of them! Childish! I mean ha when it comes down to it, at the end of the day today we we live in er a media orientated world don't we? We turn on the box Well and we we see what is fed to us there, we pick up , you pick up the you know, the comic strip papers you know,yo you see headlines there, most of it is is you know Tory sort of dominated. Orientated. But er that so it depends whether you, whether you actually think about what you're seeing and what you're reading and Well what you're hearing doesn't it? Well I mean, I I take the Express Mmmm. and they say that ad , it pays to advertise I mean, to me advertising has never done anything for me well I don't think it has anyway but if it pays to advertise and look at the number of people that read the Express What do you want Lucy? you know, the that would What? convert a lot of people if they Oh yes! definitely because it it is No! you know, I I I don't, I don't look at the first four pages in the Express cos that's No. all it is! It's running Labour down Yeah. Same old stuff! And yeah. Well in a and way how good John Major is and how good Mm. and the Tory, you know they're giving them victory because they they supposedly we're we're up to the, up to as many er we're level with the with the Labour party now. Mm. And they are, you know, this is a victory! Yeah it's pathetic! I I I think really they er they forget that that there's a quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not and aren't all that easy easily persuaded. But, having said that there is but there are, but there as well! No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see when you say they're not easily persuaded that are working class that are voting Tory and they're not easily persuaded they cha Well they did, I just changed their mind! Mm. Well having seen a little bit erm was on the other day and I I mean I I must admit I touch shut up you! Nothing to do with you! A lot of what's erm you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind. Yeah. I'm a loyal supporter! Well that's it! And that's it! But erm you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't either don't really care No! or they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about Yeah. every party! Yeah. And making sure I get the right one. But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch No. they've already made their minds up and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on on basically the choice On the spur of the mom on the spur Well of the moment, on the day think well they've had long enough now we'll we'll have a switch you know Or or the they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph and they'll go and vote for him! That's right. And I mean there's that been that much publicity about Neil Kinnock you know, or anti Neil Yeah. Kinnock publicity. But er, I mean a lot of people say ooh, you know, I wouldn't trust him with it! And they didn't really know anything about the blooming bloke you know! Well he's never been Of course not! in power before well It's only what they've read in the newspaper! Neither has blooming John Major you know! Neither has blooming Maggie Thatcher before she came in, you know! I mean it's Well I mean you've only got lo They'll be a first time for everything ! You've got to take the way her Wack her image changed Wack a wack a wack! over the years Mm, yeah. the voice the Mm. shape of the shape of her face and hair. In fact I think that Spitting Image dummy was more like her than she was! You you loo , you look Mhm. at the years how she changed, practically every year! Her image changed. Well it started to become like er A a little what do they call them? These dolls. Yeah. What do they call them? Barbie doll. Barbie doll and that's what she was. Well no, not as attractive as a Barbie doll! Well no, but But I'm but the style was there She,i it was it was becoming like a dictatorship! It was her at the helm Ooh well this is what it beca , it did And and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time you know i it really their voices on the, on the the cabinet you know, they were, they were just destroyed! Well, you said you know you, we were on about Germany and, and becoming you know could it happen again? If if she'd of had her way she would of been the dictator of this Yeah. country, and she would of been in power forever! Oh I know! You know that's, she would of been wanting to ma , make her life president or whatever it was! I think she would of done with the Que , er done away with the Queen to get Yes, I think there was a bit of competition on there wasn't Yeah. there? I'm convinced But she wouldould! Yeah, I mean If it meant her staying in power that, I mean she Well would of done it she would of got rid of them to make sure she she stayed there. Yes it came to er Are you tired? A fine state of affairs didn't it No, I'm alright Ken, yeah. with her even her own party giving Well her the heave-ho! Well this is it. You know, I mean tha She was they I mean she was go That's how it must be. she was going too far for them Well she must of been. well this is it I think she was beginning to endanger her chances of re-election and I think Yeah. they let her go on too long and it Well to be but er And er but they did let her go on too long! I mean it's turned into a bit of a joke now really Yes it has. hasn't it? You know, our policies are working, I mean after thirteen years Well they've had long enough to do it! And this recession that we've been coming out of for so many years now it's I mean it's just turned into a bit of a joke! They're all making money for themselves aren't they? That's why I'm suspicious Well of the Labour party! Well The Labour party? No, I don't The big shots you know! Money in the bank No I don't Well Whe whe when they're small they're Ken I, I but once they get a Well ah now what have I said to you ? Para power corrupts I know. Mm Mm, yes. And that's the way power corrupts. But, well it's what I've just said! Yeah but I mean That's true. you'd never agree with before! No you we , you was relating it to to power in this country to any country and saying Any country. it was exact, identical. Well it is. And that's what I disagreed with. It is. I I said It is you can't compare the ca , the power like just say in a place like Turkey which is absolutely rotten! They got no law at all, or very little with, with the Well it's corruption! Ooh yeah! I mean, if a little kid in the in the And that is, that is what in the in the playground er Well that's what it amounts to! You know It's corruption! coerces some kid into selling him his marbles, that's corruption isn't it? But there are levels aren't there? One one is more extreme than the other. So we've got corruption in us probably so it depends upon the degree Well, yes we have. but you don't expect to get out of the ruddy Aha. Socialist Party! Because Why not? Because I said to yo , I said to you that it was the same in Russia! And how much corruption have you discovered in the Socialist Party? The Labour Party? Have I discovered? You mean have I seen Well how much ? on the television Yeah. these people that Well what do you talk with two tongues and say Well what do you know about them that you say they've Yes. they've got er What do you base your i , your What happens when they retire? Well what happens when they retire? Do they end up working the way we've got to bloody work here on this tiny pension or the pension that they've earned as an MP Well have retired from the Labour Well alright Party. Harold Wilson, prime example Yeah. rich man! Lord Wilson Yeah. socialist, I mean Well how da , how do you know what ? They're supposed to be against all that aren't they? Wait a minute! How do you know he's a rich man and what do you class what do yo , what do you base in rich ? Well a man that's got more than one home for a start! Yeah. Well er Because that's erm You must have been rich then a couple of years ago? When you brought a second home! Now don't talk ru , you know what I'm on about! No, I don't, no! I don't mean a bloody home like that! No, Er, wait a minute Ray! He's he's, he's lead a public life Mm. so he can write he can write a few books, he can go out there and talk Mhm. So he earns money, is that a, is that a corruption of his job? No, well talking to earn money, no! Do you agree? Yo , I mean If he er, if he gets paid by It's the same the hour. It is the sa , it is the sa , it is the same as Maggie Thatcher going to America now Course it is! And she's Yeah. pa , and she's paid half a Well i million pounds for her Well tha that that is Yeah. worse isn't it? So I mean, er I dunno But it's it's the degree How can that how can that man as a socialist justify earning well I don't know what he gets, but we'll say he doesn't Well get as much as Thatcher, say he gets forty thousand Well no, I didn't know no you don't Oh, now wait a, wait a minute! Now I, I have said to, I have said to you He's a rich man that everybody and he shouldn't be! everybody should earn the same. Mm. But you all said that it depends on his skill or his what's his name Or how many kids he's got. If I've got twenty five kids and you've only got one yo , I need more than you! So how can you possibly all earn the same? Why not? Well you wouldn't have enough would you, to su sustain all those Yeah. kids? Why? You'd have to get enough to live on. I can't see that! I mean er No, I can't see the argument! Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway! Well that's dictatorship Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that! I mean that's, I would have Well that's, alright well well that's control of the world population, I se I would limit to two children. I would er, have control of the That's another argument! world population. Well fair enough! But Yeah. that is another argument! It is, we're on the road . That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority. Oh ! I thought your first one was everyone getting I'm not go the same pay! Yes, so everybody So would need the same pay. But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever No, but I mean I mean there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts because people would manage money differently Differently some would spend it Of course they would! as soon as they get it Oh yeah. some would go into hock and spend it before they get it before they got it yeah. some would save it, and be frugal! Alright, alright then Which is what the Tories want you see What I want I think the trouble is I want no, you're defending them! I won't give anybody any money you can go to the shop and buy what you basically need. You see yo No but we're devia your we're deviating on the subject well you did because your, straight away you go onto money which is our God isn't it? Well, no but you said it was corruption Yeah. and I've only yo mentioned, well you mentioned money because you mentioned Harold Wilson Mm. with two homes and you said the money they get! Yes. So you brought the subject of the money up! No, no Mm. but you're on about something else, you said the first thing I'd do, that's got nothing to do with Harold Wilson the first thing I if I were in power But there would which be like I Yeah. say, we're deviating on the Yeah. subject! no no no but I'm pa if So go on yo I were in power there wouldn't be any money no need for it! Then you Well I wouldn't have all I the arguments! I know that! So you wouldn't Yeah. say that at all! No. Yeah. And what would you do But in the case of these people that start off So why why should Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells what's his name? Beven miners Just for money! Well I won't say Beven because it's a bloody shame what happened to him! But never the less a lot of them started off like that didn't they? Another one is Foot. Ah but er he And as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree somebody has a talk with them so look here We know we know you're a socialist But you still earned a few bob to get on. But er, you you we're gonna make you a nice one and join the bloody club so you'll be an armchair socialist and we look after you and that's what they are! Callaghan is another example two or three homes big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people? And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them! I think he must be Bloody big cuffs!cufflinks! I think you I think you've been saying Ah well, no not Saville Row shirts! No, you're making him it's I think if you mistake, you're making a mistake there! as the leader of the Labour Party or the Liberal Party You have got to keep up with you've gotta keep up with to go image and how to be Yeah. a leader in this country! No, you haven't! You can't expect, yes you have! Foot never did! You have! Michael Foot? What did he, what where did it get him? Well you just said you just go you just said you've gotta give them a How long did it last? How long did it how long did it last? Are you, are telling are you telling me that you'd vote for somebody in rags on the television who promised you a better future? I did! What do you mean you did? Voted for Foot. Who did you sa , oh! You sod! You did not! And he was never in power anyway! He was, he was the Prime Minister! Oh he was Well! not! He was never the Prime He wasn't, Michael Foot? Oh I know he put in there. Oh no he He should of been. He's never been president of He was very outspoken he was a very outspoken He should of been! He was leader of the But the first bloody only the the way they should dress! Ah, yes well ah, that's got nothing to do with it! Oh! But now it has! I mean he's probably got more money than they've bloody got! The it's all a blind anyway those rags he goes round in! Duffel coat, he got he got censored There's because he wore a duffel coat instead Well it's like That man underneath a duffel coat What did Ken say about this chap from Vauxhalls? Convena did all his work and they asked him to go to London you know, there's some was on years ago so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said! Those lads down there they're fighting living on their ruddy strike pay and look at you lot! He said they were there the whisky was flowing you know hypocrites! And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good Well time you know. on your argument then anybody who who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top has gotta become corrupted! That's what you're saying, no ma Well if there i if there in a no matter who, no matter what ! If they're in a corrupt society and when they get to that position they they don't do anything about it and accept Well they it and take they don't the bribes, well yes I agree this is the Yeah. the Yeah. basis of the mafia isn't it? Ah, you see if if you don't, I mean it's not, it doesn't happen in, in every walk of life but in big business and in politics if you don't You have to modify your I'll tell you , I'll tell you how No, no if you don't tow the line Exactly! If you just don't if you'd be elected Yes and you don't modify you what happens? You don't get anywhere! You don't get elected which is what happened Well to the Labour government No last time! oh well, oh well apart apart from being No. elected fifty percent of the population apart from that wanted control on nuclear weapons, or wanted to abolish nuclear weapons but they the the Labour government didn't get in on that basis so they had to modify their and I mean as Well you can use that for any argument then But I mean but what what can't you? what I want Do everything the tories do because we're not gonna get in! Well Well well no I mean it's not Well that's what they've bloody done near enough! Well yeah! And another thing that I fifty thousand The, they it's a Mean time all the vil , all the mines are closing are they gonna say well yes well Well well we've gotta do that because be be being practical. Well I think it's a very being short sighted thing to do to erm Well I I think I think you'll find that well if Labour gets in I mean it's they will, they will scra , they would find that most of the I hope they'll rescind that. mos , they wo , they wouldn't rescind it. What the mines? Yes. They wouldn't close them. The closure of the mines. No! I think Well they can't close the ones that's already Don't you think so? gone in eight Oh! nineteen eighty one can they? They've Oh I know! gone! Closed! Well Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't Well some of them certainly And they closed one the other week that's flooded now will definitely so that's Yeah. I don't think that this They, they won't they they wouldn't can't rescind that! they wouldn't bring But I money on the mining And that goes for a lot of businesses! I mean, there's enough coal in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years! Yeah! And that could possibly be the only, and ah I mean it's it's a Ah but it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on Well I've no doubt in twenty I mean years time the tories will re-open them much it's it's far at at great cost to us! Ah but you see Nothing to stop them! that it's Well very short sighted to get rid of that now! I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up I know I know and we can't them any more? Well You know we , very well what'll but what happen happen! When, when that market's been pruned alright down and the only what happen place you can get it but the price is ! What happened in nineteen eighty one? They're so short sighted! What did Bob say about the miners? When, you know when that strike was on but it's like a lot of people What did he say about the Ooh that teachers? bloody lot of, bloody lot of clowns! Arthur Scargill bloody clown! Now Yeah. those fellers fought to keep those mines open and they got one of lot miners divided and said oh bugger them! The fellers in the Midlands was it? Yeah. Yo er Notin Yes. Nottingham round there? St. Helens Ooh bloody no Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa and they ploughed twenty five million into their mines and said your jobs are guaranteed now fore , forget it you know, you're alright for thirty years what . Now they're closing the bloody things! Now, you know we sho something should of happened then they should of prolonged that strike to destroy these buggers and said no you're not gonna close them! But the peop lot of people agreed with it! Well of course! They said they weren't being But realistic! what do they do, they divide and conquer Ray! Yeah but why should bloody intelligent people go along with it Ken? That's what gets my plate! Because they , because the intelligent people weren't involved! No I mean, I'm talking about the people who are not actually er, you know I i if concerned directly but give But their approval for these But they're people. they're not involved, the people the people that give their approval are the people that want it! And I mean er, and Yeah but I mean and also they, they get the masses on their side by the media! I know! The same as they're Exactly! doing now with the I mean what paper have you got? I know, well there you are! A Labour paper! This is what terrifies me! And what's, what's er what's your chance? The Mirror. Where's that ball gone? Yes. Bring that ball here! You got no bloody chance! But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel! And you never hear the Labour party criticising. You know, but they should be criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't! Well when when if if the Labour party criticised and they do criticise Oh they criticise Ken, yeah. The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on and you see it happening on the parliament and on your papers. Well you read your paper don't you? And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer We we'll watch which is, they get some they do some pretty good But how often do the I mean, they they don't give you they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week! Oh no they're or there's certain ar they only pick a certain subject or Yes. whatever that's been thrashed. As you say , we'll see. Well he's gone on seven days of the week complaining about so and so we'll just narrow that down to one article about his his complaint that they may just make a little note he's complained seven times about this! So you see a little article That's right. he's not complaining! Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example the low wages Yeah. we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France I in Yes. Italy. Well yes. Oh there we go, that was mistake number one George dear have you read the er holiday page at all? No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about Oh I'm not sure the Oh dear places you can go to Mm which is a fallacy I thought it was Barry there, he looked a bit like him. No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy. E T get down, down. Down there, there's a good boy If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are. in the U K mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping Joking aren't you camping? Well that's just what it looks like here you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night Oh we're back in France again are we? Mm Yes well Oh I see, yeah, yes it's Mm It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol Well for us I mean it's and then the ferry across it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast Yes but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel Oh yes I think so a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us? Yes I did mentioned it erm Did you to Ken? Well you were there weren't you too? I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether We didn't come into it Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details. Well this was erm Bulgaria Yes, yes Mm but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in. I certainly wouldn't coach it so I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days. Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you? Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time Yeah cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean I'm not particularly bothered whether comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he? But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming? Italy Did they? Yes Florentine or near Venice That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there Yes that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to What they got afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage Yes that's a point so, you know that's a point, yeah so unless erm even if we tell us we went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we? Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it? And it's only an hour or so away, so perhaps you should say that get a weekend in I wonder where there is a cheap place to where you can old furniture. Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture Oh no all furniture you've got no chance mm. No I mean, what is he, different in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is Oh there yes, no I meant in this country Not on par with ours is it? I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find. Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any A lot, yeah from southern Italy at all do you? Oh you see a lot of them from erm Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's paediatric coast don't you? farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them. You see them for Rome don't you? Not very often, not in here Is it tours? Not very often, not really Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm mm, what's the other one? Catonica Is it Rimini? Rimini, Catonica all on the coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it? yeah mm there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet. Oh yes the Erm the very big lady er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled Gosh Sounds drastic doesn't it? does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er But I still like either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight I still like to know how they staple it. Yeah yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er It must be an operation or Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it? Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples must be Mm she was, what, what are you doing? Stop it sounds a bit drastic Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a On the concept yep more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there? Yes it's er I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales Oh yes Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer? No They're not very flattering they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid I think er you tried to get away from the traditional type of Oh I see these one that they send in Mm Yes I er by the thousands I don't go a lot on them myself Oh poetry some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad. Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name about the gas and that Oh to be honest I can't remember the Mm, very poignant Mm, but er anti war what was the one about the erm oh it was about the assembling of the gun Oh yes, oh do you remember that? And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts That's right yes and er Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now Mm horrible. There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs Mm which are supposed to be erm Come here seventeenth century come here scallywag They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually Mm you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on and the guy that's faked it has done all this as he thought, authenticate it What, what they call it, stressing it don't they? Stressing it, yeah stressing it Mm and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable contortionist, it says here oh Mm but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish Yeah which it turned out to be wax Oh to simulate old varnish you see? Oh So then he started looking Yeah They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers Yeah I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that. I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's things that are in there, it's astronomical. Mm, quite expensive as you say Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right oh he said that heaven Mm yeah, you do huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?

I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well Mm. so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the Yes I thought he probably would. You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you? I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over. Mm, I don't think so but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all Nobody's interested no, it's a shame said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the Yes What is it? What do they call it that hall? Hawkesbury hall Hawkesbury hall, yes by the school, yeah but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe. Is it? Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it Oh oh they've just locked but er locked it up because er he said they've er So did she say she could get some? Or Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose Mm but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so it's a joke isn't it? you know Mm several of us at college oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call you would think tell me that much Which pub? at the college? well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there? Well that's the thing yeah You multiple that by getting in a little bit however many there are There's about six I think Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he? Even so, yeah So er Oh they've probably got this much you know mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that he, he got or are you Oh I just taken it in out of the book? No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us Oh said the stuff you're using is Rubbish old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off? Mm You know that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing? And that, and this, you kept getting this er Oh no you, you can use this, but you oil through don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that. Oh His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can Mm put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet So just use wax to build up the polish waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see Mm but you can that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in? That's already done innit? Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about He started just after me, yeah one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards that'll be each one of those holes, he He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the yes or well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand he will but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that Oh easily concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it? Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water And water erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole Yes so if you just put the well the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere Yeah I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it? Where's little tiddly gone? Where is he by the way? Erm I said to you he's on the settee Hello, hello, hello if he's on there just shout at him will you because oh he's in here he's by the radiator aren't you beaut? He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you? Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it. I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document Yeah to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along Personally I would of Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it? Well acetic acid is you know the chemical you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see Oh which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it? You're only, you only Well you only put putting that much in Oh in this, in like a pint Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you? That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon Mm and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon. Which chemist did you go to? Bob's Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see Aye get in your basket this minute I thought, I thought the other one had got it go on , go on. When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah you don't see erm doing this but, well after that, I mean and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or Mm bottles of already, ready mix There's a jar already done, you just pour it in Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they? You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it? Ninety percent probably The erm you get The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and Yeah which are all, er what they called? I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they? Oh their own, yes I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty so where you do it so well where you gonna go for that? Where else can you try? Er well I was gonna ask for when he comes, gonna ask or ask At the college do you mean? They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area and the chemist Mm he's an old fashioned type Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean He's bloody finished now Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than to get it, I mean he's very obliging. He lives over the shop still doesn't he? Or at the back of the shop. He's a proper character isn't he? Mm But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out Look in the pockets you great pi , oh I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you Oh jesus, Maggots I caught a few there might be a fiver in one of them You've got no chance of that Hey make a little date. Erm what about, when would be convenient for a quick tutorial? What about Thursday? Right. What about next week, what about Monday?

Right, that's two P M next Monday the first February, okay. See you then. As I said I didn't phone, I dunno who it was.

Now Mr 's philosophy Aha. has given you A for participation which is good, C for written work which is satisfactory and B minus for assessment, so it actively participates er gave a paper for the class, but no second essay. Does that mean you owe him an essay or something? No,essays, you got both you've got two essays. Well, right he's, this was probably written before he got the second one, because they would have done this last term They were handed in on time, handed in on time. Well, perhaps you ought to bring that He marked them both. I should raise that with him He's marked them both Has he? Yeah. Right. I mean I got pretty bad marks I find it difficult, find it very difficult. Really? Well, it's frustrating the hell out of me you know. Why's that? I've never done any ooh well.

Isle of Isle of oh Isle of and they sh what she went on to say is erm I hope to redress this in the shortly in other words she's shortly going to but I must say I like the expression long fingering you know bloody idle you know. Mm. So you haven't got it back? No, no she said she's gonna redress the balance very shortly. Erm when I find my glasses I Now I've got to leave at three thirty. Okay well we'll Okay Kath, right. Erm let me just see if I've got a I made a whole page of notes here dunno whether any of its important. Erm I've got the Observer Ghost Story winners we can leave that for another week. Erm the talks erm Gillian Thornton is gonna speak to us on the 23rd of February just to remind you and I've actually prepared some notes on play writing which we can fit in some time during this sort of session. Erm homework I'm Come and sit down Janet. Ann Hello, Well let me just say quickly we're being recorded there's there's someone er who's gotta er a project organisation by the Oxford University Press who's interested in our spoken word Right and he's going to ask each of us to sign a a permission form in the end, because we have our we all own the copy right you know our own spoken word and er in order that this man can use what we actually speak today, is showing to want us individually to sign a form. I don't think there's any sort of danger in it it's it's in fact for use in constructing a dictionary really. Erm so it's they're really interested in our use of language. Erm I told you about that chap Michael Bell who wrote to me about using my book as play, I'll read you his letter some other week. Erm John's Dream the National Playwright's Network actually wrote back to me and said they're quite happy to read your plays for a fee erm but I intend to re-write that before I put it in er for a reading erm Oh,I I sent a poem called Pleasure to Woman's Weekly in June last year and I suspect they were actually planning to use it but they've had a New Year's clear-out and I got it back yesterday. Erm Foxes in the Garden with the R S P C A photos I had rejected yesterday as well, so that was a good day. Erm I brought in the old flurry tape,I 've I've taped I taped our when you've read my play for me, I erm I taped it and I made a copy for Dave I you know, erm Cybil makes a good effort in that so eventually I'll lend you the tape. Yeah that's eventually I'll lend you the tape for that erm we can pass it round. Erm Mr. Parish I mentioned, sorry your name is Jim? Jim Jim did you say? Jim and he's proposing to listen to the group today with the views to joining. Jim has written, like myself his background is in technical writing for a living and he's gotta particular interest in American writers and the use of American language er I gather. Right well I'll start today if you don't mind and we'll go round in the normal way erm when we come to Pat. Pat has got five thousand odd words to read to us, so if we can scoot round fairly quickly today. Well we'll leave him till last if he's got Yeah well that's, what I was like that yeah In other words you know you What I was Pat is five thousand words is really too bit a bite you know if you really want people to criticism off it, you wanna break it down into sort of two thousand word chapters really. I couldn't get to the first part again and yeah that's right Even though you you feel it's off your back you've written, you can still read it out I could go er that wouldn't be a bad idea, because part of it would make sense to finish. Yeah well if you like. Yeah. You know five thousand It is quite a lot to read I mean I read a short story last week. Two seven . It was Two Seven and that even seems quite long you know to That's right It's quite long in the reading five thousand is as Yeah as Cybil mentioned you know I mean if if we want to criticise your first ten words it comes a bit hard up to five thousand you know. something that makes sense to carry on Mm Okay Can I just mention that nobody's read that but you'll see the last sentence says that whatever you put on that tape the dictionary keep the copyright you see and that's all right when you're on conversations, but if you were to to read in an and it was a short story, if that's you know i if they reserve Very observant yes, yes but Jim makes the point he said that if if if when you sign a declaration you say Er yeah exclude your short story, otherwise it could mean on you know it could be taken out and sold somewhere and then in interest you would sell your own for selling your own word you know that could be a possibility. Well nobody's really saying in case when any of us sign it, we must sign excluding the written work yes, yes, yeah read out and if you exclude it, I think if all us do that the best thing is to read something we've already had published. Well I think it's something like that Oh, the one that keeps up to date and updates the Oxford English Yeah, I think Even so, I think as David says, it would probably be wise to exclude your exclude your written work. I mean by the piece I'm reading you today, I've already submitted to the B B C and if I sell it if it's something that's If if they they take it, then I've sold the copyright to the B B C and I'm not in a position to offer it to anybody else anyway erm So will the tape last for the whole two hours? Yes, apparently. B B C. Yes. I don't want any of your bad language Janet . Right well let me just surely . This this is I I I'll start off as I say I've I've written a covering letter to Bank and Mitchell of the B B C and I I thought I'd read you the letter as well, because the letter does what we've often said about setting the block plan. Erm I say I enclose a short story for your consideration. In this story the principal character is a grumpy old house with a malevolent sense of humour. It is newly occupied by a young couple. In the first conflict situation the house launches a minor attack on the wife whilst possibly saving the husband from real harm. The couple settle in. Minor conflicts occur with the couple trying to pacify her, this continues up to a black moment when the house relents and saves them and then I say and this is important I think when you write for a radio, I have marked one paragraph with red brackets. This paragraph is optional depending on the reading speed. Without it, my version occupied a few seconds under fifteen minutes. The play is written for a Hertfordshire accent or similar and then you know I enclose and I say return if you don't like it. Incidentally Janet, did your piece ever come back or erm Yes Oh, it's come back. Came back. Oh. Oh Was it the Black Dog? No, that came back after all that time erm,no this this was the call called The Birthday it was about a split in the future where she erm Oh yes was a little girl on her fifteenth birthday and has it it's like an M O T Certificate, only it's an M O L Certificate for life that you have to do after your sixty five. Well I sent it to the B B C, I sent it to Duncan but I also sent it to the the Lady a shorter version to the Lady their competition and I said their competition was gonna be on the eighteenth in their issue they would give the names of the of the winners, but I had looked in the Lady yesterday in Smiths and there was none of nothing about it, but I don't think I've won anyway because it said you'd be notified by post so. that they run late on Yes it does. I've had one away five months to but I I I No, but this has been published It's been published December the fourteenth and I haven't had my copy yet which was in Central England. Oh,Central England. Yes Yours was sent to sent on to the charity work. Oh, you did do it and I didn't. Very important. Right I'll read you this piece and you'll have to forgive my facsimile of a Herts. accent. Home sweet home my Roy Ramsay. We fell in love with the cottage at first sight. It was snowing the January day we moved in. The cottage was old and grumpy, she didn't make us welcome. Cottage means small house. This house was large and had four bedrooms. She didn't like her name, she didn't like anything. I was a young man, I was virile and vigorous. She didn't like me . I well remember our first night with the aid of father-in-law we spent a long day moving ourselves in. He was in a van and two estate cars we made many short journeys. We'd loaded and unloaded furniture, tools, books and crockery, the contents of house and garage, greenhouse, garden and shed. The cottage had solid brick walls, none of your modern self-insulating cavities. The ancient boiler had sat in sullen silence for ten days, a drifting cave under a mountain would have offered more comfort. The rooms were too chilly for the youngsters, so we left with mother-in-law. I bought some coal and lit the sulky boiler. Four hours later the cottage had allowed the temperature to rise a degree above freezing. We made a last cup of tea on the camping stove and retired midnight. We lay awake all night startled by strange sounds. We was too cold to sleep, to exhausted to search out extra blankets from unlabelled tea chests. Holding each other close we wondered if this was a senseless move from a tiny cosy semi. In the morning the fire was cold and the cottage once more below freezing, she burst a boiler. While I was making some tea there was a tremendous crash. Me wife screamed. I flew up the stairs to find a huge hole in the ceiling, at the foot of the bed covered with plaster and ice. Water ran from the hole. Of course at that time we didn't realise she'd done it on purpose. We had just finished finding the wife some dry clothes when there was an explosion downstairs. The camping stove had blown up. At least I was upstairs when it happened, no-one was hurt. We waited, tea-less all day for the gas man to connect the cooker. We had fish and chips from the local chippy for lunch, dinner and supper. The fire had a good appetite too in the cold, we burnt exactly one ton of anthracite in that freezing January. Life got back to normal, we picked up our bearings. The back of the house faces south, an avenue of giant elms and a few old oaks lay over that way. The house on our western side had been empty for years. It's back garden was a jungle. Among lots of small trees was seven fifty foot black it's front garden held two mighty elms. I loved the trees, but having this forest next door, made sure our garden only saw the sun as he moves from east to west early in the morning. The rest of the day we never saw him. We loved our home in the woods down in the lane. She didn't love us. Outside, the cottage walls were a horrible battleship grey, the woodwork was depression brown. The interior was dull and decrepit with lots of layers of ancient wallpaper. My wife and I loved a challenge in those days and we could see what it might become with hard work, but it was a real challenge, no mistake. We tackled the house bravely enough, we started with the childrens bedrooms. Next we did the kitchen and breakfast room where we fits an efficient gas boiler. We battles on in dining and sitting rooms. We found out that the sitting room had a timber panelled ceiling which had been papered over and given lots of coats of whitewash. Father-in-law and me soldiered six weeks to restore it looks now. We papered and painted two big bedrooms, bathroom and toilet. We installed bigger radiators everywhere we went. We began to win the temperature battle. Lastly, worst of all the landing hall and stairs, all those doors, all that white paint. Several times the cottage tried to throw me from the scuffle boards, one night she succeeded, I got a badly twisted ankle. I told her you won't defeat me. Next year my wife starts in earnest on the gardens, driving back to Blackberry and Elver, while I experiments with the outside colour scheme. All the walls I gives three coats of brilliant white stone paint, easier to say than to do. Black and white seemed a suitable work, the front door was painted long yellow. As I say, the back of the house faces south, the summer sun was on the upper frames all the time. He soon blistered the glass in black. With a fight the frames were changed to white and yellow which reflects the heat rather than absorb it. Time passed, we improved the house. I hoped she'd begin to feel grateful. We fitted new carpets, lamps and staircase. One summer I changed both sets of French windows for doors with Georgian frames. I give myself one hundred and twenty new panes to varnish round, who says we grows wiser as we grows old. The house grinned. The owner of the near-ruined house next door came and had his forest felled to sell the property. We gained a sunny outlook and some neighbours to enjoy. The house smiled. The let in some afternoon sun which burnt the still black paint on the front paint work. I saw what she'd been smiling at. We settled for yellow and white all round. The two boys shared a bedroom, the spare room was our office, the boys were six years apart in age. In a few years their needs were very different, the young one needed to be in bed and the older one wanted to play music with his friends. Then my wife had her brain wave. There was a wide space beside the staircase, the stairs rose up to the boys' bedroom wall, then turned left to join the landing. On the landing the first door on the left opened up a walk-in cupboard. Why not, my wife says, knock a hole through the boys' bedroom wall, pinch a three foot six strip off it and make a new landing passage and extend the walk-in cupboard, forward to take up the old landing and sideways to build a space out to the main part of the stairs. It was brilliant. When the work started the house was furious, she put every possible obstacle in the way of the builders and arranged for it to rain as soon as the slates come off. She made sure all the plumbing and wiring was in the path of progress. Every hole drilled in the walls met a stone, she blunted every tool. When everything was finished, the younger boy moved in. For weeks we bumped into strange doors whilst making our way to bathroom and toilet in the dark. The house chuckled. At last, to pacify her, we fitted a new bathroom. That magnificent cottage suite with gold- plated fittings should have pleased her. She showed no sign. To prevent her playing nasty tricks on us we had all the old lead and iron pipes taken out and the rust galvanised tanks replaced with trusty burst-proof fibreglass. We thickened up the insulation in the loft to deaden the midnight sound of her dropping chips of toil on our bedroom ceiling. At last, I thinks I seeks her problem. In the dead of night I crept down to the breakfast room, the nerve centre. Listen house I says, you are not a small house, the cottage never was suitable. We are going to change your name, we are going to call you the Wallering Remember Christopher Robin, his wise old house spelt his name Wal We're going to name you for the elms at the foot of the garden. In a fit of temper she arranged for all the surrounding elms to catch Dutch Elm Disease and quickly died. This drove out the tawny owls. She could be a nasty devil in those days. Suddenly I was struck down by an illness. When I was at me lowest me wife beat me, she excelled herself and managed magnificently when the family's happiness depended on it. I went blind in me right eye overnight. At first I could find no cause, I panicked, if I could go blind in one eye without a cause, perhaps I could go blind in the other. I could become a burden to me wife and family, not only that, if I couldn't pay the mortgage they might throw us out of the cottage. I started two schemes, first I increases the monthly payment on the mortgage, then I starts a separate savings account. Gradually the mortgage comes down and the savings goes up, but there's still a gap. Then, bugger I down dead if she didn't get me. I was painting the back of the house one Saturday, when she shook me off the ladder, I got a compound fracture on me left leg. Well, I'd had so much time on the sick, they put me on half pay. I couldn't pay the mortgage. Things got very black indeed. The bank was hard, they said they would foreclose if things didn't improve shortly. At last the house relented. As I lay in me bed each night, I heard an eerie, moaning sound from overhead. On the third night I woke the wife, she couldn't hear it. The boys never heard it either. When they was all out at work on Monday, I could stand it no longer, I pulled down the loft ladder and dragged meself up it, plaster and all. On Thursday, my brother Dick the doctor visits me. We did ya this copper kettle he asked, I've not seen that before. Oh, I've been hearing strange noises up in the loft lately and I got up there to see what it was. Do you remember, Granny used say copper kettles was lucky. Well I found an old brown paper parcel tucked right away in the corner where the noise was a- coming from, but I couldn't find what was making the noise, I opened the parcel and found this old kettle. All black it was, I spent two days cleaning it up. See, the kettle is copper and the stand is brass. Look, it's got a lovely little spirit stove underneath, it's got a boar hunt engraved right round the middle. Let me have a close look at it says Dick, putting on his glasses. Dick is my next youngest brother, he's been the village doctor round her for twenty years and a keen collector of antiques since he was married. I passed the kettle to him. He removes the lid and examines the whole thing closely. He hangs and hoars a bit then studies the trivet the smooth stove with its little lid on a chain. You've got a fine here he says. Don't you know a list of every time is marked W F S in a diamond. Yes, I did see that, I says. Does it mean anything important? Yes, I think it does he says. If I'm not mistaken, it means it was made by W F Smith of Stockton in about seventeen hundred. It was always an ornament, it was never meant to be used as an every day kettle. It would pay you to run this up to Sotheby's for evaluation, they've got a man there who specialises in things like this. Thanks Dick I says to him, taking it from him and passing the bottle, perhaps I will, I'd no idea it might be valuable, I just like copper and brass bits and pieces. Well of course you can guess the rest, I took it up and had it valued and then put in an auction. We got nine thousand five hundred for it. I bought did Dick a bottle of and paid off the mortgage. We're sitting pretty now. At last the house has made our peace with us and hangs on to her slates in the gardens. Having got the kettle was certainly lucky for me. The funny thing is I never heard that noise again. Fred Thomson has been reading Home Sweet Home by Roy Ramsay. . Yes it's struggle in accent Yeah,I I wrote the thing as you remember about eighteen months ago, but it had no conflict in it you know we're all the same and stories must have conflict, so I got the house to burst the ceiling on the wife Yes and then while he was upstairs seeing and helping his wife, then the the stove blew up downstairs, now that might have been the house saving from a real disaster whilst attacking his wife in a minor way, or it might have been pure coincidence. But er Hertfordshire where they the other the black moment you know th the bit where I I put in the bit where the he broke his leg and the mortgage was gonna be foreclosed on him I mean that builds up to the black moment which is a necessary part of the story and then he got out of it erm because the house relented and showed him where the copper kettle was that was worth the money. use the word black seems to be getting very black. There is consensus out there of some people who their self politically correct and they do not like the word There was a man being interviewed on tele the other night he said that these people are trying to destroy the English language by their I won't be changing it. How many words does that write It's I've I was telling David outside that I've absolutely butchered it and I it's erm two thousand one hundred and sixty. As I Two thousand one hundred and sixty now? Yeah. Oh. Why does it seem longer? T frankly, yes it did, but I mean you were reading it pretty well correctly the way they read I mean most of us read things I know I do myself, one reads things quicker than perhaps some would if we were reading them on a radio or something. Well I've been practising this. and erm if you listen to things on the radio they they have at the end of a sentence or at the end of some sentence quite a pause for a second before they go on Well as I've taped that I taped it at home Mm. but as I wrote this and you know put in the acc th the conflict, it came up to two thousand five hundred words and I taped it and timed it and I've been butchering it and cutting out all the really nice little sentences and the nice sentences and I've got it down to two one sixty and now with that announcement on the end,as I've got it taped, it's fourteen minutes fifty-nine seconds for a fifteen minute slot, so it's about as precise as you're gonna get it. Yes. Erm and I may have slowed down a little today, I don't know I should have timed it again. What It's fiction Kath stop worrying. I know. A kettle. There was one though on the Antique Road Show where there's erm er girl brought in a kettle and they've been using it just every day and it was pottery and it was actually to buy her her own house. Showed it the following week. Yeah well we've got a little antique box a jewellery box and it's embossed the pattern round it, and the pattern round it is a boar hunt and it's beautiful, there's a little boar galloping his heart out with horsemen after him with spears and he's all the way round the box and I thought of adding him on to the copper kettle you know as engraved all round the outside. I've got no idea of what it might fetch, but as I say it is fiction Kath, don't worry about it. No, I was just enthralled Absolutely. Well I was watching one of those Antique Road Shows quite recently and I found a chap got one of those little sort of two inch diameter one inch high chamber pots and he said and where did you get this and she said er at a car boot sale and he said and how much did you pay and she said twenty five P. He said well you're very lucky he said by my estimation that's worth four thousand pounds I was, I was thinking cos I've got an old copper kettle Right, well the time's passing we will have to push on. Have you got anything Peter? Yes. A certain no dialogue today or anything like that. This is one of my film articles which I mean it's of the things that I've sent of and I know it will be published because I belong to the Cinema Veterans cinema and television veterans and they have this quarterly magazine and almost certainly you know it will be published in there, there's no There's confidence that's what I like to see. Well I mean you don't get paid for it or anything. Oh. there's no money in it Oh well that's a bit of a letdown Peter. Yeah, no well. Did you send your other one in Yes, I have I posted it off during the week to My Weekly, because I thought because the it was about a girl in all trouble, I think it You're telling avoid that like perhaps appeals to womens magazines more than the other stuff but I know that I mean it's not romantic in that way is it's not a romance No. Oh Yes. This is Right Peter This is called the Men Who Called Action. In the past the British Film Industry has produced many great directors, Sir Reed, Michael Powell, David Lee to name but three. These top directors will not be forgotten in the future, for apart from their films, much has also been about them. At the same time as these directors were making their classy films, there were many other directors churning out the cinema of workmanlike entertaining pictures. It is to these directors many of whom the industry forgot in their later years that I wish to pay tribute. One such director was Maclean Rogers who was born in 1899. In the early thirties he was employed as an editor for Herbert Wilcox at British and Dominion Films at Elstree. It was at B and D in 1932 that he directed his first film, the Mayor's Nest starring Sydney Howard. He continued throughout the thirties making mostly low budget productions that were made to fulfil exhibitors quotas requirements. During the 1940s he directed many films for and British National. I envisage and this is what I believe to be his last film Not a Hope in Hell early in 1960. Although mainly a director of low budget productions, he told me that before the war he concerned it a poor year if he did not earn six thousand pounds, quite a sum for those days. The last time I saw him was at Walton Studios a few months before they closed down and the was he was doing he said he was unable to get a film to direct, so he was going to be Herbert Wilcox first assistant director on his forthcoming production. Unfortunately, this film was never made. Another director also born just before the turn of the century was John Harlow. In his early years he appeared in concert parties. He was also a musical performer and also acted on the dramatic stage. He entered the film industry in 1927 as an assistant director. Spellbound was the first film he directed in 1940. It was a low budget production but drew a certain amount of attention as it attempted to explore spiritualism. Derek Fowler was the leading actor. John Harlow directed a series of films for British National, but probably his biggest success was While I Live which featured the very popular music the Dream of . In the 1950s he was finding work hard to come by. In 1955 he was employed for one week by Douglas Fairbanks Limited at Elstree as a cover director, British cover director on a T V film that was being directed by an American. He spent the week sitting in an office at the studio where in the past he had directed at least six feature films. Ernest Morris born 1950 started in the business as a trainee on the construction side at Gainsborough's Lime Grove Studios. He later transferred to the production department as an assistant director. His opportunity to direct came from the Danzega Brothers He directed many of their T V series and second feature films. In 1961 they made their last T V series, Richard the Lionheart. Ernie directed all the thirty-nine half-hour episodes, just two second features without a break. He continued to direct films for Geof Parsons and others, but when the market for supporting films came to an end, he found it hard going. He would have been quite happy to have been employed as a production manager an or as an assistant director of which he was first class but the work did not come his way. He ended his li his work in life as a postman. Robert Asher, brother of camera man Jack Asher, was born in 1916. He entered the industry as an assistant director in 1934. Over the years he became one of the top first assistant directors in the country. He began directing in 1959 with Follow a Star, a Norman Wisdom film. It was a success and he went on to direct five mor Wisdom comedies. He also directed a Morecambe and Wise film and co-produced and directed with his brother, She'll Have a Go. He also directed a number of episodes of various T V series, but then the same old story, little work. He would also have been happy to have found work as a production manager or an assistant director. The last time I saw him was at Pine er was at on the as T V series at Pinewood, where he was acting second unit director. He was a very dispirited man. I will mention two other directors who sometimes made slightly higher budget films, Lance Comfort 1908 to 1967 his many films included and Temptation Harbour and Lawrence Huntingdon 1900 to 1967. His films include the Upturned Glass and the Franchise Affair. Both these directors fared much better than the other I have mentioned insomuch as they were working right up until their death. The directors I have mentioned I knew personally. There were many others of equal merit who deserve to be remembered, perhaps someone else would care to write about. I mean it's you know, it's just to to people in the film industry and obviously it has little interest reading it to There was one which you said Ernest Morris was born in 1950. Fifteen. Oh, fifteen. Yes. I thought he said fifty as well. Oh no, fifteen. I was gonna say you you s I thought you said 1950 and you said he was directing in 1961, you know I The ordinary cinema goer sees a lot of glamour in directing and producing and God knows what else, but you you really postman No, well he was he I knew him quite well because I lived in at that time when I w was on that T V series, I lived at Pinner. He also lived at Pinner and erm then the work dried up and he first of all he did work was a postman at Christmas time, you know just as a thing and then he started you know then he became full time you know. Were there no jobs sort of in between the director and the Well there were the jobs tha that I mentioned really, production manager or assistant director and now he would have been quite happy I know to have done those, because I remember talking about it you know er and he would have been very good at either of them, but erm er he he didn't get well he was a slightly abrasive man,he he he his erm I I think in a way erm he was a director who could who was not really a very good film director, he he could get things done very quickly and that's why he worked for bash, bash, bash getting through everything quickly. He didn't have much finesse to do the things but erm and I think he used to sh he although I I got on all right with him, but some of the people working on the floor like the wardrobe people and that he used to they used to dislike him because he was but I would but you do find s I think perhaps he was a bit unsure of himself because I don't think he was somebody who'd had a had a tremendous education, otherwise he probably wouldn't have gone in on the on the construction side which was being a chippy or something at Shepherds Bush and so you know you often find people like that they have a bit of a chip on their shoulders don't they you know, you know. Plus I learned that you know from from our group reading of my play the other week, I learned what the function of a director was because you know obviously I shouldn't have given you all your parts to read for a week to sort of work out what the inflection should have been. Yeah, because They've just given you a first read. You don't realise how many inflections are possible in one word and every important word the wrong inflection was used you know. I thought ah, now that's what a director sorts out, you know I mean that was that was er very useful. That Castle was that the story by A J Yeah. Yeah, a really good book that, I've got that at home. Right, Janet, your go. Oh she's got a B B C letter. Refusal oh yes. Er do y it's er printed, it's nothing er I enjoyed reading your material this is B B C. Mm. or you won't. I enjoyed reading your material, but after consideration I'm afraid to say that I cannot make use of short stories. We receive up to a hundred and forty week Oh. and while we do consider each one, cannot offer individual reports or criticisms of every script that arrives. Many of the stories selected for short story are from published collections established authors some are commissioned specifically for the slot. We do use new writers, but they have to compete with these other sources. Briefly the requirements for short story are for fictional narrative based er narrative based scripts of two thousand one hundred to two thousand three hundred words do not use a factual accounts or anything longer or shorter on this, nor can we consider 60 Writers Monthly No, no. Well I get it but I don't read it. something about a novel you know. Janet,Not what you write what you said B B C Yeah. Well it's, it's very much an , but I mean it's my ambition to break into it. you know. Yeah, but you know I mean you gotta keep Thi this really everything in life doesn't it Yeah or nearly everything. Yes. I mean if you're Yes, if you've got the right name If you've got the right name, if you've a a number of or something coming in to for a part and of of them you've seen on television and done a lot equally or as good or better, but you're gonna be go for that one probably. That's right. An and everything they be be architects or something, you're gonna pick one who's who who said well I did that building at London Airport or something like that. Next thing, next one I'll send in I'm gonna sign it anonymous because my name may dissuade you. Oh it's a shame because that piece was brilliant, I'm surprised they didn't take that was very good Yeah , I'm very surprised about that, I really thought,I I'm or I was but I really thought particularly the length of time that was away I was really sure that had got on to incidentally it's worth saying that the B B C re they do they use professional readers who make a report on every piece they receive and they file them. So if ever you read work apiece, and re-submit it, you must change the title because if if you send it in, they look up to see if they've seen that title before, if it was rejected before it will be rejected automatically. So if we do a work you must change the title. Do magazines do they same? I don't know. but certainly the B B C do It was It was Ralph was it? Yeah,I I've well that makes a change you know I mean some of my stuff's come back from them and I've wondered whether they've read it. Yes, I've noticed that with magazines, but this was erm sort of er you know. No, it looks as though Do you think Janet should send it to one of the other regions like Manchester or somewhere Why don't you, why don't you send it to erm let me see what's her name erm Gilligan Hush Gill Gillian yeah Gilligan Hush of Radio Manchester. They're very keen on new playwrights. Yeah, but not cockney accents. Yeah, well give it a try, give it a try. She tries all sorts of accents. I mean th there's a competition for a monologue for Wales, but who wants I mean Ah well, give it a go understand All these Well give it a go, I mean a monologue is a monologue, they're not saying a Welsh monologue are they? No. Well give it I didn't know that, I'm er Yeah they assess in Writers Monthly Oh well that or was it in erm perhaps it was in the that you got. Yes, Variety. Variety. You see the piece I just read is a monologue and if I'd known there was a competition for it I'd have sent it there rather than to Yeah and this is Writers er erm Magazine. Magazine, Writing Magazine Oh I don't have that one. Which is part of Writers erm Writers Weekly I would have thought, Writers News. Well Writers News. Oh, Writers News Yeah, the other one. Writers News. Which I might do when this er present year runs out. Well I buy Writers Monthly, but I never read the damn thing, you know, so I Well this is and I noticed erm sort of do my in this particular one, she said she's interested in North American Indians Oh. Yeah. and and she said something about through her interest in North American Indians she'd written this novel. She didn't say what it was or who published it or anything, but it made me you know think you know, so I wrote to her care of Writers something and erm asked her what's the name of it I would like to read it because I had also written something about the er American Indians and erm er who's the publisher or what's it called, I'd like to read it. I mentioned just about, and I got this this erm letter from her. Oh, good. It's erm letter of passed on to me by . I am pleased you're enjoying my series of articles on writing a novel, hope you gained something from the rest there should be seven in all. My interest in North Plains people in 1750 to 1850 which is about the same period for the you know cowboys goes back many years to my pre- writing days. The novel mentioned in the second article is a Winter Man Mills and Boon masquerade Really? Mm Oh well you know where to try then. Well I've ordered it at the library because they didn't have, they used to, but it's gone. Erm and as you will probably be able to deduce from the publisher, is a an historical romance. It was published in eighty six eighty seven, although it's no longer available in shops, it can still be obtained through the library service if you care to request it, which I have . I'm afraid I haven't a spare copy to forward to you even on a loan basis, one never allows for the contingencies which arise. . Regarding your own story you state that this is a fantasy, but you don't give details market juvenile, adult,fantasy, supernatural, horror. As a publish writer yourself I told her I've been published articles you will understand the need for market targeting and as you mention at twenty thousand words is not full-length, though this could be if was aimed at children. If it is your first work of fiction of any great length, I think you are doing the right thing putting it forward for appraisal by the Eastern Arts Board, you are lucky in your part of the country to have this . comments you could consider entering it or part of it in one of the many fiction competitions or submitting it in total to a which takes fiction. If it is your first work of fiction, you should also look at it as part of your groundwork which although it may never see the light of publication, is of great benefit to you as a writer. A brickie does not college N B Qs he needs to build his first house and first novel and immediately becoming an international best seller. Okay occasionally it happens, but I for one am a and I have the unpublishable manuscript in a drawer to prove it. I wish you well with your writing, remember talent is very useful and perseverance is a necessity. That's very good. Mm. Isn't it? Yeah, yeah. That's very nice of her to write that. I think erm what she's really saying to you is that writing's not an art, writing is a science, bloody hard work. Yes. You know getting on with it. Yes. See I didn't write asking sort of advice telling her No, that's very nice of her No, that's very good. So er That's very nice of her to write Yes. And is there anywhere now. Oh yeah, I see it yeah. Well when you said something like that, it's not just one person who's gonna have a look is there? Is it? So I mean you have to send one copy, unless they take the bother of the copy they have received may gone to somebody else. No. Yes. I mean what really your hope in looking after that is is they will come up with some idea of publishing. Well if it's publishable, they Oh that was she was supposed to come today, but she phoned up last week erm she is gonna come but I don't think that a date has been arranged yet. These are some of the extras standing around on Middlemarch. Oh. It was on wasn't it? Yes. Yeah, it was repeated or something. Oh, it's brilliant you know I mean er, I've I've telling him what I've doing this week. Yeah. I've erm nice photographs They are letter and I've read I look at the first enjoyed it I mean what the strange thing is that I was reading about The writers is that Middlemarch at the beginning, she did it in class Well a word processor is much much better to use because it's so easy to you've gotta change everything that follows, whereas you know, with a with a word processor you can add paragraphs about words in change words. A word processor is so much more power than a typewriter you wouldn't believe it. physiotherapy sort of exercises and that. Yeah, you've got to go what time? Three thirty. Okay, well do you mind if we take Kath No not at all. You lost them? You can borrow mine. Try mine no it's all right You put them in you Right. Right now Kath, you can start us off. You wanna Okay Janet You're on. Am I? with the glasses It's not in there. Help. Nobody's Did you drop them on the floor? Put them in your pocket? You read that last piece without glasses thinking about it. No no, you did have them on, no you did have them. Yeah you did have them. There's a pair on there. They're mine. leave the room. Can we erm can we let Ann have a go then. The ashtray yes Because the recorder's on. Well I don't know whether it's good enough for a recorder, but erm I I the ends a little bit because I was rushed to get her so Is this your er chapter of your story? No, it's a short story really. Oh, fine, fine, fine, good but it's it's not brilliant, I mean Art to regain his breath as he stepped through hang on a second what's the title? I'm sorry I didn't actually give it one. Now Ann I keep telling you. Oh yes I know, I'm sorry. Well shall I call it. A short story. Works. Spring and Autumn or something like that Art to regain his breath as he stepped through the swing doors into the ordered gloom. Shutting his eyes, he stopped and was there the one he always remembered from his childhood polish, dust, though not so much now as the smell of books. He paused at the counter struggling with the straps of his shopping bag as he laid his self-regulated three weekly books on the counter. She was new medium height, dark with a shiny fringe and big brown eyes. He caught his breath. Mary, no it couldn't be. Good Morning. She looked straight into his faded blue eyes as he slid his books towards her. The smile was exactly the same, but the voice was different, it had a soft fur, Devonshire was it? He couldn't be sure. Thank you he said absent-mindedly and went through to the Natural History. From here he could get a good view of the counter desk. Yes, she looked almost exactly the same, unbelievable. He picked up a huge book h he picked up a large book with a huge green dinosaur on the front. Strange he thought, there seems to be a current fad around about dinosaurs, there was one on top of a bottle of bath oil one of his grandsons had given to him for Christmas and another was perched on the handle of a nail brush in the bathroom. Toby had a pencil with a blue one on the end it its scaly tail curled around the pencil and the head was spiked down the neck could be used as a rubber. Odd looking things he said himself quietly. It all happened years ago, can't understand why they brought them up again now. Mrs Blick moving carefully around Natural History in search of something to help an earnest nine year-old with his holidays. He's on a holiday project her talking to himself. She smiled, over here is her remarks and hoping all was well. Morning Mrs Dear how are you? Fine Mrs. Blick, and yourself? Art nodded politely. He liked Mrs. Blick one of the old school, always addressed by name, a caring sort Good Morning Mrs B. Over the years their relationship has developed so that Art now called her Mrs B. He had once served at a library committee but that was when her husband was alive many years ago. Didn't know you were interested in dinosaurs she smiled gently teasing him. Their seem to be a lot around at the moment. Really, she laughed. Well you know what I mean knew very well and nodded. Did you enjoy your holiday with the family she asked gently, knowing that Art lived alone now and welcomed the invitations from his eldest son Toby and his wife Lynn. Yes thank you, it's great fun there and the two rascals have got these things everywhere he indicated the dust jacket where a green scaly monster grinned devouringly at both of them. It's pointed teeth remind him of some giant cheese grater with a mind of it's own, face smiling ready to strike. They were on the mantelpiece in the garden even in the bathroom. It was yo-yo's in my time yo-yo's and parasols. I always think a woman looks pretty good under a parasol, even better under a pretty hat, his eyes looked distant. Daphne laughed, I'll see you in a moment she said kindly. Art raised his eyes to the receiving desk, she was standing she was standing talking to a young man. My how like is Mary she looked so very pretty. The dinosaurs were spying as he replaced the book. He hadn't wanted to learn more about them, not really, ugly things after all and it was a long time ago. He moved into Fiction, checking his favourite thriller author. He always put a very tiny pencil mark on the end papers at the back of every book he read, his very own secret sign. He knew he ought not to mark the books really, but it was only a tiny mark in pencil and no-one could accuse him of defacing library property, not really, it wouldn't do for an ex-library committee member to be caught defacing library property now would it. Art has served his country town well this country town well, he lived he all his life all in a small cottage down by the river. He'd won a bursary to a local grammar school when he was eleven and then gone on to an apprenticeship with an engineering firm which employed a quarter of the town's local inhabitants. That has sadly gone now, another victim of the recession. Art had always tried to give back what he had gained in life, he felt grateful for what he felt he had to be given, some said he'd achieved a great deal, but in his heart he felt fate had dealt him with him gently and you have to make the most of the lo of the card life deals you. He as content and his worry was his younger son, if only he would settle down like Toby and Lynn, find a nice girl, make a home. Art checked his books, there were a lot of little marks on the end papers, other readers marking their patch no doubt, defiling narrative as dinosaurs have devoured other less fortunate in the past no doubt . He thought of them, somehow communicating to ea to each of the boroughs through their own little secret signs and realising their flight of fancy. He moved to the counter, you're new aren't you he said. My son's looking for a wife. He stopped, it wasn't his normal behaviour to speak to the staff in so familiar a way, after all he had his dignity. The girl blushed slightly and then laughed, well we're a public library, not a marriage bureau. He paused still looking at her. How like Mary she was, incredible. Out through the swing doors he made to the Rendezvous Coffee House. Daphne was already there at her regular table. I like the new girl he observed conversationally. Daphne studied the menu a new one, a friendly dinosaur snaked down the side holding the printed menu between its paws. Damn things keep cropping up everywhere Art observed conversationally. She's right nice, just qualified now to college, from Taunton you know, Daphne says steering the conversation in the way she wanted it to go. It's only here temporarily she's only here temporarily she added. Why has she come here for goodness sake Ar Art barked mentally choosing mushed up mushroom omelette and a roll of butter. What are you having. Grill grilled plaice Daphne said and coffee. The waitress appeared for their order, jacket sir she enquired as Art placed the order for both of them. Jacket potatoes, yes please Art replied. How's Steve, Daphne well knew the heartache Art's younger son caused him. As well as I'll ever know he replied gruffly. I'm retiring in a few months Daphne said quietly. Retiring, shouldn't have thought you were old enough, Art was brought up with a jolt. What will you do? I've decided to move. Really? Art was surprised. Where are you going? Taunton. Art could not speak, he had become so used to meeting Daphne for lunch once a week, it was part of his life, he felt shocked, strange, bereft. Taunton was where Steven lived, where the lovely young girl in library He looked across at Daphne, she was looking at him searchingly her eyes questioning. I'll be sixty five in two months time Art, it's time for a move, they'll be a lot of time on my hands. Sixty five burst out Art, I didn't think you were anything near that anywhere near that age. Well I am. Daphne's look was indecipherable. But that's not so far off as I am, I thought you were much younger than I. Blushed and took her hand she did not take it away. It puts a different light on things. Does it Art? Toby and Lynn live in Taunton Art observed and Steven's nearby Daphne added. Suddenly the future looked very bright indeed. There there you go announced the waitress setting two hot plates before them. Art winced at the vocabulary, it was a current phrase me speak to these young men, and place a wrong construction on the nightly communication, for all the other inmates were in bed. So I failed to do right, lest I should be suspected of doing wrong. Afterwards, I thought that I might have closed the window with noise enough to warn them that some one was near, but without letting them know who it was. I took myself to task rather severely about this, but conscience cleared me so far. I really had not thought of the window until too late. That fair night was the least satisfactory I spent at Roundtree Farm, so far as sleep went. I passed the hours in a whirl of conflicting emotions. I was thankful for the good opinion of two such men as Mr. Marsden and Mr. Winn. Their words proved that they had judged me fairly. But my tell-tale heart was at first in a flutter of joy at the thought that the one who had stolen into it and taken the dearest place, had also given me the same in his. The joy, however, did not continue unalloyed. Much of it could never leave me. If I were never to see him again, if I were to spend my future life in loneliness, there would still be this memory; a good man thought me worthy of his love, and would have made me his wife, if he could. I am afraid I began to feel glad that I had not thought of closing the lattice until it was too late. It seems strange that after such thoughts I should have resolved not to see Mr. Marsden again. He had called me brave. I said to myself, "I will deserve his good opinion. He shall not have to take Mr. Winn's advice, and run away from me. I will run away from him. I will not bring him into a contest with his mother, or sow the seeds of trouble between them. If there is a trial to be borne, I will take the larger share. Besides, Lois Anstey is not quite without pride, or a sense of her own value. I do care for Mr. Marsden, but even he should seek me and take pains to win me; and into no family would I enter unless the mother could hold out motherly arms and bid me welcome as a daughter." Two circumstances enabled me to carry out my resolution without difficulty. Mr. Marsden and Mr. Winn had started on one of their usual expeditions before I was down in the morning, and the post brought me a letter from Mary Baxendell, in which she implored me to spend the rest of my holidays at High Lea. "We are at home," she wrote, "ten days sooner than was at first arranged. At least, my mother and I are here, and feeling rather dull, as my father is still away. If you will come to us, darling Miss Anstey, I shall be quite reconciled to our shortened tour. Do not trouble to write—come." Go I did, and on that very day. I told Mrs. Jennings that a friend wanted me, and must set out with as little delay as possible; that I was not going straight to Hillstowe, but should be there in due time to resume my teaching. I soon packed my belongings, which were placed in the farmer's trap amid many regrets and hopes that I would go to Roundtree Farm next summer. Then, having more than satisfied my kind landlady, I turned my back on Hailsby-le-Beck, and thus passed that fourth milestone out of the six I wish specially to remember. CHAPTER V. MARY BAXENDELL gave me a delightful welcome. She clung round my neck, kissed me, called me the best of darlings for coming so quickly, and then danced off to tell her mother of my arrival. Mrs. Baxendell, less demonstrative, was no less kind, and the remainder of my holidays sped very happily, in spite of memories of the kitchen at Roundtree Farm, and those who gathered round its hearth. Stop! I must be true. Was I quite happy? Did I rejoice in the thought that Mr. Marsden would have no means of tracing me if he wished to do so, and that under the circumstances I should soon be forgotten? Again, I must own that my happiness was not quite without alloy, and I wondered whether, if he cared so much for me, I had a right to risk his as well as my own. I was half tempted to send a line to Mrs. Jennings, "just to inform her of my arrival," I said to myself, and then I scouted the idea. If I had written, my letter would have been for no such purpose, but from a cowardly regret for having run away, and to give Mr. Marsden a chance of following and finding me. In my own mind I pictured the scene at the farm, when Mrs. Jennings delivered my farewell messages to them. I could imagine Mr. Marsden's dismay and his friend's sympathy, which would be half congratulatory. I seemed to hear inquiries after my destination, and Mrs. Jennings' reply that she did not know it. Then there would be a hunt for the letter I had written when seeking accommodation; but that would be vain, as I had myself twisted it up as a pipe-lighter for Mr. Jennings. There was little writing done at the farm. I had really answered my own note, for I had sent an addressed envelope, and told them just to write the word Yes' on a slip of paper if they could take me in, and I had been obeyed to the very letter. There would not be a scrap of writing which would guide Mr. Marsden either to High Lea or Hillstowe Vicarage. To the latter, Mary Baxendell and I returned in company. The girl was a sweet, sympathetic creature, to whom I spoke with much freedom on most subjects, but, it is needless to say, not on that nearest of all to my heart. I kept it to myself, and it was hard work, because human sympathy at such times is very precious. Only at mornings and nights, as I knelt in my quiet room, with no sound but Dot's gentle breathing to reach my ear, did I open my heart and pray, "Father, I do desire to be numbered amongst those that love and serve Thee. Do Thou make all things to work together for my good, and help me, at all cost to self, to do what is right." We had trouble at the vicarage that autumn. Good Mr. Barr became seriously ill, and Mrs. Barr was almost worn out with anxiety and nursing. I did my utmost to relieve her, but there were so many things in which only a wife or an elder nurse could be of use. I grieved to see her so overwrought. I knew what a terrible difference this illness would make on the wrong side in the income, all too little for the brightest days. Friends were kind, and many helps came from generous hands, but more were needed. I was afraid Mrs. Barr would break down, and then what would become of the vicar and the children? He began to mend at last, and then the patient wife's strength gave way to some extent. I well remember her making a great effort to get outside Mr. Barr's room door, and then sinking down in a faint on the landing. She had made it to save him the shock of seeing her fall. My heart ached for them all, and for the first time I grieved over my own poverty. Mrs. Barr said rest would put her all right again, but rest seemed as unattainable as many other things for the mother at Hillstowe Vicarage, though she took care that nothing should disturb her husband's quiet. "His life means the children's bread," she said. "It is of far more consequence than mine." To us who looked on, and mourned that we could do no more or better, it was hard to tell which life was more precious to all concerned. The vicar was gaining strength and talking of beginning his pastoral work again, though the doctor protested against it, and said Mr. Barr must go away for a time first. The vicar's doctor was not the only medical man who orders the unattainable for his patients, and knows he is doing it. But at this time, friends came forward and presented a well-lined purse to Mr. Barr, together with loving allusions to his past labours and hearty wishes for his future health. Then poor Mrs. Barr's face brightened, a temporary curate was engaged, husband and wife went to Devonshire for a month, and returned a fortnight before Christmas, with renewed strength and thankful hearts. They say that troubles never come-singly, and it happens now and then that the rule holds good with regard to blessings. A couple of years before that, the bishop had held a confirmation at Hillstowe, and, as his custom was, had preferred the simple hospitality of the vicar to that of a wealthy neighbour. Mr. and Mrs. Barr had not entertained their right reverend guest with stories of difficulties and trials, or complained of their many olive branches and few pounds per annum, or shown him long faces. On the contrary, they had just been their good, true selves, and had made him as comfortable as possible, without going out of their way. The bishop had departed with pleasant words of farewell and thanks for Mr. and Mrs. Barr's hospitality; and there, as was thought, the matter ended. It did not, however. The bishop remembered Hillstowe, made his calculations, and wished, vainly for the time, that he could give Mr. Barr a better living. Then he heard of his illness and recovery, and then, too, came the bishop's opportunity. Immediately after the vicar's return, a letter arrived in the diocesan's own handwriting, offering him a living, worth eight hundred a year, in another county. There was joy and sorrow, both in-doors and out, at the news. Joy for the vicar's sake, sorrow that he would be lost as the pastor of Hillstowe. I was nearly wild with delight. I did not know at first that this change would mean separation from the Barrs. So it proved, however. The beautiful little rectory to which they must remove with the new year had been built by a childless predecessor, and would be too small to hold the troop of juvenile Barrs, to say nothing or Mary Baxendell. Moreover, the Baxendells would not spare Mary to go any distance from High Lea. Until the rectory could be enlarged, it was settled that the elder girls should go to a boarding-school, and the twin boys should attend a good day-school, which was within an easy distance of their future home. My occupation was gone. My pupils were about to be scattered, I was to lose the precious little one that called herself Miss Anstey's baby, and whose curly head had so often rested on my breast in sleep, and enriched me by her sweet presence! I should lose the companionship of Mrs. Barr too, and more. I must begin to look round for some other work to do, some roof beneath which there would be room for Lois Anstey. I was very down-hearted, not because I had to work for my bread, but for fear I might not find the work to do, and at the thought of going out again into the wide world and all amongst strangers. It was in vain I took myself to task for selfishness. I did rejoice in the good which had come to these dear friends, but how could I wholly forget that the message which brought new life to them was almost like death to me? It had been previously settled that I was to spend Christmas with the Baxendells. I had half hoped that they might engage me as governess to Mary, but I found that Mr. Baxendell shrank from the idea of having a governess in the house. He seemed to think it would spoil its privacy, and prove a restraint to him and his wife. Mrs. Baxendell would have liked to engage me. Mary pleaded for this with her father. But though he rarely denied his pet anything, he would not yield in this matter. "My wife and I are a Darby and Joan couple," said Mr. Baxendell. "We are quiet, too, in our ways, and we would never condemn a young girl to the loneliness of a separate room, because we so often find two to be company enough. Mary, our own child, hardly counts as a third in the same sense." I could not plead for a corner, or say that I should be contented with solitude at High Lea; and so it was settled that music and other teachers should come from a neighbouring town to give Mary periodical lessons and complete her education at home. The girl displayed more temper about this matter than I had seen in her before. "As if I should ever do a morsel of good all by myself!" she said. "It is horrid to think of solitary lessons, and I know my teachers will get no credit out of me. I would rather have you than a whole townful of other people. I know I shall hate the very sight of them." She broke into a passion of tears, and I was obliged to look stern and say, "You will make your parents feel that I have taught you badly, Mary, if you rebel against their wishes, just because they do not agree with your own. Besides, they will not care to have me as a Christmas guest if my presence is to stir up a spirit of opposition in their only child." [Illustration] "Oh, dear! Miss Anstey," replied Mary, with a helpless gesture; "then I know not what to do. I must not vex my father and mother, though I so badly want you to stay at High Lea." Then, after a moment's abstraction, "I do wish my cousin Lawrence would marry you. He is very nice, and just the right age—twenty-five." What could I do but laugh at this absurd speech? "You dear, foolish child," I said, "you must have made up your mind to drive me from High Lea. If you wish to keep me for a little while, never allude again to my remaining beyond the holidays; and, above all, never couple my name with that of Mr. Lawrence, or any other gentleman. It would grieve me sadly; and, more than that, I should run away of my own accord." "I would not grieve you for the world," said the child, covering my face with kisses. Mary Baxendell was now fifteen, and a very child in frankness and innocence, though in some respects older than her age. I said to her now, "A year ago, when it pleased God that I should be left fatherless, I prayed to Him to direct me, and I did not ask in vain. I have had a great deal of happiness during the year, and I have more friends than I possessed twelve months ago, as well as more money in my pocket. I came to Hillstowe with just half-a-crown left. When I said good-bye to the Barrs I had six months' salary to begin the world with again. I am comparatively rich. If I could leave myself in God's hands immediately after my father's death, surely I may trust Him after an enlarged experience of His faithfulness." "Dear Miss Anstey, I know you are right," said Mary. "But you need never want for money, you know, because my father would give me anything I might ask in that way, though he will not have a resident governess for me. And, I had nearly forgotten, my cousin Lawrence and my aunt are expected before dinner-time." This announcement concerned me little, and I went leisurely on with my arrangements, only determining that I would not go to the drawing-room until just before the gong was sounded for dinner. CHAPTER VI. A FEW minutes before dinner-time, Mary Baxendell came for me, and we went down together. In the drawing-room were her father and mother, and an extremely handsome, stately-looking lady, in black velvet, and wearing some fine diamonds. I could not help noticing that her hair was whiter than her face would have led me to expect, for her complexion was fair, and the colour on her cheeks might have been envied by any girl. She looked still more remarkable from the fact that her eyes, eyelashes, and eyebrows were very dark. "Aunt," said Mary Baxendell, drawing me towards this lady, and doubtless considering that she had special vested rights in her governess, "this is Miss Anstey." A tall young man, who was looking out at a window, and whose back was towards us as we entered, started as Mary mentioned my name. Almost before the aunt and I had exchanged salutations, Mary cried, "Cousin Lawrence, let me see your face, please." The young man turned in compliance with this unceremonious request, and in the face thus presented I saw—Mr. Marsden! Which were playing me false? Eyes or ears? I understood how my bewilderment had been caused when Mary continued— "Miss Anstey, this is my cousin, Mr. Lawrence Marsden." I had only heard him called Mr. Marsden at the farm, Mrs. Jennings not being likely to mention his Christian name. He and his friend addressed each other as "Marsden" and "Winn," whilst Mary Baxendell invariably spoke of him as "Cousin Lawrence," and of his mother as "aunt." Mary opened her eyes very wide when she saw Cousin Lawrence's face light up with pleasure and my own flush crimson as we shook hands, and Mr. Marsden said, "Miss Anstey and I have met before, and I am very glad to meet her again." For myself, I hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry. I thought of the stately lady in velvet and diamonds with some trepidation; but when I turned my eyes in her direction, I saw that she was smiling benevolently, and that there was absolutely a gleam of half-suppressed amusement discernible about those fine eyes of hers. There were but the six of us, so Mrs. Marsden paired off with Mr. Baxendell, Lawrence took his aunt, and Mary and I linked arms and went together. I was, however, fated to sit next my acquaintance of the farm, for Mary was placed next her aunt on one side of the table, and I was between Mr. Baxendell and Mr. Marsden. My younger neighbour was very considerate. He made no allusion to our former meeting, and for this I was grateful. Being such a small party, the talk was general, and I soon felt quite at ease. I even lost my dread of Mrs. Marsden, and could hardly believe that this lady, of whom every one seemed so fond, could possibly be the mother of whom the two friends talked on that moonlight night in the porch at Roundtree Farm. That she doted on her Lawrence there could be no doubt, and in my eyes he had never looked so attractive as when paying those little tender attentions to Mrs. Marsden that every mother delights to receive from a stalwart son. We had yet two clear days before Christmas, and, to please Mary, Mrs. Baxendell had left the decorations to be prepared under her superintendence. Of course, my pupil and I worked together, and Mr. Marsden, while pleading want of skill, offered to do his best to assist us. "I am not sure that your best will be good enough, Lawrence," said Mary; "but we will give you a trial." Then he humbly suggested that he might save our fingers at the expense of his own, and he cut holly into suitable sprigs, fetched and carried and nailed devices and twisted wreaths until even Mary was fain to praise his willingness, if not his skill. This was at High Lea, the church work having been done by other hands, and more of them, mostly before we came. While the house decoration was in progress, Mr. Marsden made frequent sly allusions to "green stuff," and brought in many of the expressions Mrs. Jennings was accustomed to use in our hearing at the farm. Mary innocently attacked her cousin on this subject, and said she wondered where he had picked up such odd expressions, whereupon he demurely suggested that she should ask her favourite referee, Miss Anstey. "As if she would know!" replied Mary, contemptuously; and Lawrence rejoined, "Miss Anstey is such an encyclopaedia of knowledge according to you, Mary, that I quite thought she knew everything." Whilst the decorations were in progress, Mrs. Marsden saw how much we three young people were together, yet neither interfered nor frowned upon us. On the contrary, there was that humorous expression to be seen on her face at intervals, and I caught her exchanging looks of a highly significant character with her son. Sometimes I fancied these looks had reference to myself, and then I felt my face grow hot, and wondered if the mother and son could possibly be amusing themselves at my expense. I was angry at the thought almost as soon as it was conceived, and ashamed that it could have been allowed to enter my mind. Before Christmas Day came, however, I felt almost ready to run away a second time from Mr. Marsden. It was so hard to be constantly in this man's company, knowing as I did from his own lips how he once cared for me. And, alas! Knowing that each day he was taking more complete possession of my thoughts and affections. How was this state of things to end? Would he now be just the pleasant friend of another brief holiday, and then go his way and let me go mine, wherever this might lead? I think I would rather have died than let any human friend look into my heart then, and I kept up bravely whilst in company with others, though no more miserable coward than myself ever moistened a pillow with nightly tears, or dreaded the coming trial of a new day when alone. On Christmas morning I felt better than I had hoped to do. Every one was so kind. I had prepared some little gift for each of the family, the guests, and servants. They were simple matters, the work of my own hands; and I was truly thankful that no person in that home of wealth humiliated me by the bestowal of anything costly. A little purse, a letter-rack, a paperknife, and an ink-stand were given me by the three Baxendells and Lawrence Marsden. Mrs. Marsden actually bent her stately head and kissed me, after thanking me for a dainty woollen kerchief of my own work and design. Then she added, "I have something for you, my dear, if you care to accept it. Do not estimate its value by its size, for it is rather a ponderous article, and might be in everybody's way, if I gave it just now. You shall see it this evening. I have found a similar article valuable, and I hope you may, too." I thanked Mrs. Marsden for her kind intentions, and then we all went to church and knelt together at the Lord's table. This sweet service did me more good than can be told, and after joining in it, I was enabled to shut out determinedly all memories and thoughts that would have interfered with the joyous celebration of Christmas in the household. I returned to High Lea looking and feeling happy, in a renewed sense of God's great love in Christ Jesus, and of His unchanging faithfulness. There was much to occupy my attention. Children came for gifts, neighbours were entertained, and it was only after they all left, that Mrs. Marsden bestowed her Christmas gift, in this wise: she drew me into Mrs. Baxendell's boudoir, a charming little room off the large drawing-room, and bidding me sit by her, said: "Christmas is the time for a fireside tale, my dear, and I want you to listen patiently whilst I tell one. It is about a mother and son who tenderly loved each other, for the husband and father was gone, and these two were associated alike in thought and work. I suppose all mothers look with a jealous eye at their lads, even when there are several, but when there is but one, he is all in all to a widowed parent." "Well, this mother's great anxiety was that her son, when he grew to man's estate, should mate worthily, and perhaps she watched him too closely if his eyes wandered in the direction of any girl with whom he was in company. Perhaps, too, her very eagerness for his well-being was a little selfish, and stood in the way of his comfort. Only she did not know this at first." "Again and again the mother interfered, less by word than with a sort of management by which she contrived to carry him away from neighbourhoods which she thought dangerous. But I daresay the young man smiled as he yielded, knowing that he was heart-whole, and that the change mattered little to him." "You must not think that the mother wanted a rich or titled wife for her son. He had wealth enough for both. But she dreaded the thought of his being married for the sake of it, and not from the true love and esteem which alone can make marriage happy." "She saw, too—more's the pity that such should ever be—that girls showed themselves eager to attract the young man's notice, and practised little airs and graces, and threw themselves in his way, even mothers openly lending themselves to such scheming." "The young man saw these things too. He was not blind, and he kept aloof and never committed himself by word or deed. He was courteous to all, but waited until he should see the girl whom he might endow, not with his worldly goods alone, but with the richer gift of a whole, true, pure heart—such a girl as he could reverently take to his own heart and home, as a most precious gift from God." "He met this girl by a strange incident, in a far-away spot and at a farmhouse. Do not start, dear child; hear me out. He wished to tell her what was in his heart, but love for the old mother made him determine first to speak to her, and he hoped to go back to the farm carrying her consent and blessing along with his love story, to its object. He was half afraid, too, for you must know that he did not quite understand the old mother with whom he had passed his twenty-five years of life. He thought she might wish him to choose a girl who had riches as well as worth. Whereas, what the mother wanted was a girl of this kind: well-born and educated, pure-minded, modest, requiring to be sought before she was won, bright in temper, unselfish in disposition, brave where courage was needed, and yet thankful, as woman should be, to lean on a strong arm, if it pleased God to give her one in the shape of a good husband. And the mother thought that the girl could not be all these things unless she had the love of God in her heart, and thus shining out in her daily life." "Money immaterial, she wanted her son to have the fortune in his wife." "The son saw the girl I told you of, and took great pains to make himself acquainted with her life-history, both before and after she ran away from the farm." "For she did run away, and certain circumstances enabled him to guess why, but he knew her whereabouts, and bided his time. Dear me! I shall not be able to finish my story," said Mrs. Marsden—for, utterly broken down by emotion, I was sobbing audibly—"in fact, the last chapter has still to be written, and I must offer you my Christmas gift." Mrs. Marsden opened the door, and Lawrence entered. "Here it, or I should say 'he' is, my dear. I do hope you will take him with a mother's blessing, and when the last chapter of the story is completed, you must turn story-teller, and let me know it." Mrs. Marsden kissed me affectionately, put my trembling hand in the firm grasp of her son, left the room with less than her usual stateliness, and closed the door behind her. "Lois, my dear, will you accept the mother's Christmas gift, and will you let me keep the hand she has placed in mine? You are the one love of my whole heart, Lois. Can you give me what I ask, darling, your love in return?" So spoke Lawrence. No wonder I found it difficult to reply, but I did manage once to look up in his dear, honest face, and to tell him, though with trembling lips, that he was the one love of my life too. And he was content. This Christmas Day was my fifth milestone. My story has grown to a greater length than I intended, so I will finish it as briefly as possible. Lawrence told me that after I left the farm, he found out which room I had occupied, through seeing it undergoing the process of scouring and scrubbing, which invariably followed the departure of a visitor. He asked to see the room, in case he should bring another friend to Hailsby-le-Beck, and thus took the bearings of the porch. By putting two and two together, he judged that I must have heard the talk between him and Mr. Winn, and that my flight was the consequence of it. About my address at Hillstowe, he had no difficulty. People who write little, exercise their memories more than those who do, and both Mr. and Mrs. Jennings remembered the name of the vicarage under whose roof I lived. Then Lawrence knew that I must be his cousin's teacher, and having talked matters over with his mother, they joined in inquiries about my family and personal history, which satisfied them. The result was the little plot by which we all met at High Lea, and into which Mr. and Mrs. Baxendell had heartily entered, Mary Baxendell being the only member of the family who knew nothing of her aunt's intended Christmas gift. There was no question about my teaching again. When I left High Lea it was in Mrs. Marsden's company. I stayed with her at Nethercourt during her son's absence, for a previous arrangement took him—much against his will—to the Continent for a couple of months. In the summer, Lawrence and I met again at Mrs. Baxendell's, then I stayed for some weeks, first with my friend Mrs. Goulding, and lastly with the Barrs, their rectory having been enlarged in the meanwhile. I was not married until the following autumn, for I wanted Lawrence and his mother to be better acquainted with me before I became connected with them by the closest ties. During the interval, I paid many visits, including one to my old nurse at the lodge, and one, in Mrs. Marsden's company, to Roundtree Farm. I do not speak of Lawrence's companionship. It goes without saying that where I was, he was also to be found as often as possible, the maternal wing being extended over me in loving fashion. In this respect, Mrs. Marsden anticipated the relationship, and was as a true mother to me from the day she bestowed her Christmas gift in such a whimsical way. She always declares that it was my running away from her son that won her heart, and that if I had not shown Lawrence that I must be sought and wooed before I was won, he might not have been so eager to follow. We were married at Hillstowe Church, Mr. Barr officiating, and Dot, my erewhile baby, acting as the very smallest of a troop of young bridesmaids, led by Mary Baxendell. Mrs. Marsden herself gave me away, on the principle that by so doing she should give public effect to that which she did in private, when she bestowed Lawrence upon me. I could tell of many subsequent events—of continued friendship with the Barrs, of Mary Baxendell's wedding, five years ago, the bridegroom being Herbert Winn, Lawrence's best man at ours; of the fact that Lady Minshull and I have been on visiting terms for five-and-twenty years, and that dear Mrs. Marsden still lives, and is the most indulgent and handsomest of grandmammas and old ladies. But even these happy particulars do not stand out with the same prominence in my life's story as those I have already told about. And I think most girls will agree with me, that the day of days in my life was that which gave me him who has been the beloved husband of eight-and-twenty years. I reckon that on it, I passed my sixth milestone. FINISHED AT CHRISTMAS. CHAPTER I. A LITTLE love story! This is what I am going to tell. I hope no one who reads this plain statement of my intentions will be shocked thereat, and close the book as though the subject ought to be tabooed in these pages. Yet there are people, and good women amongst the number, who so little understand that love, if it be worthy of the name, means beauty and purity, and embraces the very holiest and best in our human nature, that they would banish the word from every story that is written for the young. They would bid an old wife and mother like me lay down her pen and refrain from using it on the sweetest theme that creation can furnish. Such readers as these would link the idea of love rather with the fallen and sinful state of humanity, forgetting that the first pair of lovers were also the first created of mankind, and were such before sin possessed a name, much less a place in Paradise. Would the silencing of tongues and the laying down of pens keep young hearts from throbbing, or silence the voice which God Himself has placed in every breast and endowed with eloquence? Far, far better for us older folk to treat the subject with tender reverence, and manifest our loving sympathy with our young ones who are just placing girlish feet on the enchanted ground which we trod in the far-away past. The subject is, perhaps, the only one which has an interest for people of every nation, age, and condition—which has in it the "touch of Nature that makes the whole world kin." It links the queen and her humblest waiting-damsel. It joins in its mysterious bonds the monarch who can bestow a crown, and the peasant who follows the plough and dreams of the day when he can call a tiny thatched cottage his home, and prepare it as a fitting nest for his village playmate who has just passed him, poising a well-filled pail upon her head. The glimpse of her bright young face and the kindly smile of her brown eyes have put new energy into the toiler, and he resumes his work, albeit a moment before he was watching the lengthening shadows, and longing for the moment when he should unyoke the weary horses and take the homeward way. No use trying to silence Nature's voice in the breast of the young. It may speak little and shyly. The fair cheek may flush and the head be bent, but thought will be the busier for the very reticence of the tongue. And we old folk, what can we do? If we have nothing but sweet memories of pure joys that were ours in the far-away past, let us at least thank God for these, and give our sympathy to the young. Will not those who have walked in love towards God and each other whilst on earth, look forward to a reunion which shall last whilst eternity endures, with the dear one who has gone before for a little while? Tell us what kind of life is looked upon as the hardest. Not one of poverty, labour, difficulty, or even of affliction. Poverty and labour are lightened, difficulties smoothed, trials more easily borne with love for a companion. Suffering is almost forgotten when the tender voice of sympathy is heard and the pillow smoothed by affection's hands. Unrest is easier to endure when kind eyes watch beside the sleepless, and become moist with tears because the power to aid falls so far short of the will. The loveless life is the only really hard life. He who is all Love has shown us that with it we feel rich, but having all beside, we are poor without it. If parents could but see this, they would realise that they are exercising one of the most delightful of their privileges when sympathising with their children. They live again the days of their own pure young love, in the happiness of their girls and boys. Once an excellent lady, who was neither wife nor mother, said, "If I could have my way, I would keep every word relating to love out of books and stories for girls." Ah, dear lady! Then you must take many a passage out of the "Book of books," and begin the excision with the very words of the Creator, "It is not good for man to be alone." But having indulged in this little introductory preach, I will begin my story. Mrs. Manning was perplexed. A glance at her comely face was sufficient to show this, for it usually wore such a different expression from the half-puzzled, half-troubled look which now overspread it. Surely worldly matters could not cause the perplexity, for everything around her indicated a fair measure of prosperity, from the handsomely furnished room in which she sat and pondered, to the dainty lace which dropped so softly over her well-shaped wrists. Mrs. Manning was abundantly satisfied with and thankful for her present position, though during her fifty years of life she had experienced many trials. Early married, and almost perfectly mated, her first great sorrow came when her husband's death left her a widow, and with five children to care for and start in life. No light charge for a woman to whom anxiety had hitherto been a stranger. Still, she thought that having experienced such a trial and lived through it, no other blow could inflict a wound worth thinking of; but she had to learn a still harder lesson. Widows who have children must be brave for their sakes. They must dry the tears, or drive them back and weep only at convenient seasons, and indulge in sweet memories when present work and plans for the future do not demand all their powers. And who does not know that there are sorrows, as well as joys, with which none may intermeddle, not even those of our own households, much less the mere acquaintance or the stranger? At first, no anxious thought about worldly matters entered into Mrs. Manning's mind. Her husband had been deemed a prosperous man, and she had never been required to count the cost of any reasonable indulgence. His illness had been too short to allow of any conversation on business matters, and when, after his death, these were looked into, all was in order. There was an apparently flourishing concern. There were no debts. Why should not all go on as before? Just because the clear head was not there to plan, the guiding hand to direct. There was no one to step into that place and keep the well-balanced machinery going. And so the business went down, and it became necessary to wind-up the concern in order to secure a pittance which would just keep mother and children above absolute want. Years of struggling followed. The widow kept a brave heart, cheered on her children, and the two eldest being boys, these soon began to help, instead of to require assistance. The worst of the fight was over, when an unexpected ally came forward in the shape of Uncle Edward, her late husband's half-brother. He had always been ready to help, both with his counsel and his purse, and perhaps the more so because the widow never sought the latter kind of assistance. Uncle Edward was the eldest son of a first marriage, and twenty years the senior of the widow's late husband. Having lost those who were nearest to him, he began to look round amongst his relatives for some who should cheer his lonely fireside, and selected his half-brother's widow and family. Once more, Mrs. Manning found herself the virtual mistress of a lovely home, and surrounded by all the comforts to which she had been accustomed during her happy married days. Her boys were getting on in the world, and had wives and homes of their own. Her eldest daughter was also married, and though she had not made a good match, as the world estimates marriages, she was happy in her country home, and the true helpmeet of her husband. Mrs. Manning had felt keenly disappointed when the Rev. Charles Peyton made his appearance and asked for her daughter. But what could she do? The look of happy confidence on his good, true face told her that he did not come to the mother without being pretty well assured of what the daughter would say on the subject. When she put him off for a little while, until she had talked with Mary herself, it was with little hope that the consent now deferred could be finally withheld. "It would be a great change for you, Mary. Now you have everything provided that heart need desire. And I have always counted on you girls doing so well," said the mother, with a sigh. Mrs. Manning looked regretfully into Mary's face, flushed with the sweet consciousness of being truly loved by the one whom she would have chosen from all the world. "Shall I not be doing well, mother?" she asked, very softly. "What higher lot need a woman desire than to be the wife of a good man—one whom she can reverence and look up to?" "But you will be poor, Mary. And lately you have known nothing of poverty, though you can remember those years of trial when every penny had to be counted. Ah! I thought you would all take warning by that season of adversity! I can hardly bear to look back upon it now." "I can," said Mary, "and thank God for it. But for having gone through some trouble, how should I be fitted to sympathise with others? That precious time—for it was precious, darling mother, though to you it seems sad as you look back on it—was just my training ground. But for it I should be frightened to share Charles's responsibilities. Mother, dear, do not say No. Charles seems sure of Uncle Edward's consent." "My dear child, just think how you will live on two hundred a year! How will you make ends meet?" "Did you ever hear a story of Uncle Edward's, about an old bachelor friend of his, who was inclined to marry?" "I cannot tell, Mary. Uncle Edward's stories are too frequent for me to know which of them you are alluding to. Go on. I see by your face that the moral of it will be an argument for marrying upon next to nothing a year." Truly, the rippling smile that crossed the young face was suggestive enough, and Mary lost no time in telling her story. "He was not quite an old bachelor at the time, but verging on it, and had been very careful and saving. I do not know how much the man had a year, but it was enough to set him considering as to whether what was enough for a single man would suffice for a married one. He tested the matter in this wise. He had a large pie made, and when it was placed on the table, he divided it equally, and surveying one half, said, 'Yes; there would be enough.' Then he cut the halves into quarters, having made the calculation that there might in time be more than two to provide for." "Very prudent, my dear. What was the result of the second calculation?" "That it would still do very well; but not contented, he divided the pieces again. Ah, mamma. How shall I tell you? He decided that such a division would not do at all. Placing his arms round the dish, he said, 'Come all to myself,' and from that time relinquished every thought of matrimony." "Do you call that an argument in favour of your marriage, Mary?" asked the mother, with a hearty laugh. "Yes, mother; because you have not yet heard the sequel. The man lived a lonely, loveless life; ever adding to his means, saving for those who were but far-away kinsfolk at the best, and whose chief thought was, 'How will the old man's money be divided at last? Into whose lap will the largest share fall, when he can hold it no longer?'" "He is dead now. He had no kind hand to minister to him in his last days; only paid nurses. No son or daughter to bring their little ones to make his home ring with childish laughter; no wife to mourn for him, or look forward to a meeting in the Better Land. But there are plenty to put on the semblance of grief, and first to squabble over, and then to scatter the money amassed in sheer selfishness, by the man who could not bear the prospect of sharing with others the good things that God had already given him, and determine to work and trust Him for more." Mrs. Manning's heart was that of a true mother, and she could not look on the sweet girl-face without longing to make the path smooth for her child. But she had set her mind on seeing her girls do well and marry well. She could not endure the thought of all the petty calculations and the incessant contrivances that would be needed by the wife of a poor rector in a country parish. She enumerated, one after another, the probable difficulties which would beset her, and bade her think well before coming to a decision. When did true love fail to discern a rift in the clouds, or to find at least a promise of sunshine, however heavy the sky might look at the time? The mother's prophecy had no terrors for Mary. "I have thought," she said, "and I have still so much to learn. But I have never cared for finery, and a worldly life has no attractions for me. I would rather pass my days as the wife of a good man, working with him and for him, than marry well according to the world's estimate. And if I make up my mind to a life of quiet usefulness in God's service, even if it should cost some self-denial, in His strength I shall be sure to succeed. We two, Charles and I, will work together and pray together, for we 'are agreed.'" No need to tell the issue; and seeing the happiness of her daughter, the mother was fain to be content. Still, in her heart she said, "I must be careful that Katie and Elsie do not follow Mary's example." CHAPTER II. WE found Mrs. Manning perplexed, and well she might be. Mary's story seemed likely to repeat itself, and she was, for the moment, feeling dissatisfied with everything and every person. Her son-in-law had obtained promotion, and now, with an improved income and a greater responsibility, was the rector of a town parish. "Just the man to work it well," was the verdict when he entered upon his new sphere of labour at St. James's, Rathbury. And the wife who had been "as good as a curate," and better than most, according to the verdict of the village folk, now owned that her husband would need other help, if the poor were to be visited, and a much-neglected district satisfactorily worked. When Mr. Peyton talked of his coming curate, Mrs. Manning took instant alarm. She lived outside the town, and fully three miles from her son-in-law's parish, and she was quite determined that for the future, the junior clergy should be kept at a distance. No amount of excellence should suffice as an excuse for an introduction. "Remember, Charles, no curates shall come here so long as Katie and Elsie are unmarried. Afterwards. I will manifest my hearty respect for the cloth by a double share of hospitality. But I have one parson, and a very good fellow, as a son-in-law, and I am resolved not to have another, if I can help it." "Well, mother, I will do my utmost to keep away or scare away all dangerous characters. Nevertheless, I stoutly affirm that you might do worse for Katie and Elsie than my Mary has done by her choice of a country parson. Ask her if she would change, could she undo the past!" "I know well enough she would not. But you know what a bitter disappointment it would be to me if Katie or Elsie were—" Mrs. Manning paused, for, after all, however well she and her son-in-law might understand each other, it is rather a difficult thing to look a man in the face and tell him what was on her mind at the moment. Mr. Peyton, however, took her words very good-humouredly, and went away with the laughing remark, "Whoever may be the means of bringing an enemy to besiege your citadel, the blame shall not rest on my head." So far, so good. The mother dreamed golden dreams for her gifted Katie, and for Elsie, with that lovely face and tender nature. She could hardly think who would be good enough for either, and with the goodness which must, after all, be the chief qualification in a candidate, there must be abundant means, so that no breath of adversity might blight her darlings. The mother was not worldly enough to make wealth and position the first things. The man who should ask for one of her girls must be good. But the refined gold of religious and moral excellence must be gilded by the baser metal which the world calls wealth, and generally values at the highest price. It was three months before our story begins when Mrs. Manning, thus indulging in a daydream, had her vision rudely disturbed by the sound of voices. She lifted her eyes, and there, sauntering along the path, came a group, the first glimpse of which filled her with dismay. The two grey-headed men, with linked arms, and deep in friendly talk, were Uncle Edward and their own clergyman, whose visits were eagerly welcomed by young and old at the Priory, Mrs. Manning's present home. They were deep in parish matters and plans for the benefit of their neighbours, and all unconscious of the trio behind, made up of Mrs. Manning's fair daughters, and, in her eyes, the most objectionable curate that ever wore the cloth. Objectionable, not because the cut of the aforesaid cloth indicated any extreme party, but because, as the mother instantly decided, he was one of the handsomest, and externally the most taking individuals that had ever donned it. The mother groaned in spirit. She had beaten back the enemy in one direction, with the certainty of no second advance from that quarter, and here was Uncle Edward calmly leading on a new attacking party. "Why did you bring Mr. Gilmour here?" she asked, after an evening during which the gentleman alluded to had made himself exceptionally agreeable. Uncle Edward opened his kindly eyes to their utmost width. "Surely you do not know anything bad about him!" he exclaimed, with a look of alarm. "I had no idea you knew him at all." "I do not. I never saw him before, and I heartily wish he had not come here now." "Why, my dear? We must see him now and then, for he will be our neighbour. The rector considers himself especially fortunate in having secured such a man. He has distinguished himself at Cambridge, has been three years in orders, bears a high character, and, Harvey tells me, takes a right view of the responsibilities before him. Fastidious as you are, you can find no fault with his manners, and even the girls must own that Nature has favoured him so far as externals go. He is a fine manly fellow, not ashamed of his own profession, but, I do believe, desirous of glorifying the Master in whose service he has enlisted. I was so pleased with the young man that, as I bade him good night, I said, 'Come when you like, you will find a welcome.' And he said, 'I shall be only too glad,' as if he meant it." No going back from this. No routing an enemy thus supported. Beside, Uncle Edward was the master of the house, and his sister-in-law the graceful stewardess, who assisted him in dispensing hospitality therein. He never, by word or act, hinted at her dependent condition; but she could not shut her eyes to it, or forget her indebtedness to the man whose roof sheltered her and hers. Three months passed, and Douglass Gilmour had won the good-will of high and low in the parish of St. James's, Rathbury. Even Mrs. Manning was won over to acknowledge that any mother might thank God for such a son, any girl be proud to possess the affection of so good a man. Looking from the window on this particular afternoon, she caught glimpses of a white dress flitting here and there among the trees. Beside it was a tall figure, "every inch a man," to guide, shield, and support the girl who should trust herself to him as a partner for life. A man and a Christian, bright, earnest, true! And the mother wished she could add "rich," for the sweet, shy face and tender grace of the girl formed so lovely a contrast to the partner of her walk that she owned to herself Nature had seldom formed two more fitted to walk together. "And that is the worst of it," thought she. "Elsie has such a good excuse for liking Mr. Gilmour. Twenty times more than ever Mary had for choosing Charles Peyton, and yet she found more to say than I could answer." Another glance out of the window. The wearer of the white dress was sauntering back alone, having parted with her companion. And the mother, looking back through the years, found in the memory of one short day in her own young life a key to the happy light which shed its radiance over the fair face of her youngest darling. Even that memory could not conquer the motherly ambition—she called it prudence—on behalf of her child, and she resolved to have a little talk with Elsie then and there. CHAPTER III. "ELSIE, dear, I thought Mr. Gilmour was coming in for a cup of tea, and to say 'Good-bye.' Is he coming?" "No, mother; he had to do some visiting, and could not stay. He asked me to say Good-bye, and he will endeavour to send you particulars to-morrow about that case he has been inquiring into for you." "Where did Mr. Gilmour leave you, Elsie?" "At the gate, mother dear. He asked me to see him safe off the premises." A little light laugh and a pretty blush followed this reply. "Elsie, dear, he comes here a great deal." "Yes, he seems to like us all very much. He is especially fond of—you and Uncle Edward. You ought to be much flattered, for everybody wants to see him often, and everybody cannot, though none of the poor people are ever forgotten in his round." "But, my dear, do you think you should have gone to the gate with Mr. Gilmour? You are very young, dear child, and very apt to do just what comes into your head." "Surely that was not wicked. Indeed, if it had been, Mr. Gilmour would never have asked me to do it; he is so good. Even old Miss Chatterton owns that, and is about to send for a niece to pay her a long visit, because she is pre-eminently fitted for a poor clergyman's wife. She can make sixpence go farther than anybody else's shilling, and has had enormous experience in district visiting and the management of a clothing club. Miss Chatterton thinks Mr. Gilmour should have a wife—in case he should be made a bishop, you know, dear." Elsie's face was brimming over with fun. All the softness had fled, and mischief was now written thereon in prominent characters. The mother pictured Miss Chatterton's niece as a youthful copy of her aunt, and thought how such a one would mate with Douglass Gilmour. The result was a hearty laugh, and Elsie's triumph. She liked to appeal to Mrs. Manning's strong sense of humour, and used it for her own ends. "But, Elsie darling, putting aside Miss Chatterton." "Most willingly, mother, and her plans for Mr. Gilmour, to which I really believe he would object, if he knew about them." "Do be serious, Elsie, I want to talk of yourself, not of Miss Chatterton." Elsie manifested immediate alacrity, and suggested that the change would be an improvement. "Dear, it is about Mr. Gilmour, also." "A further improvement, he being so much better than I am and feel I ought to be. He is always trying to influence me for good—I am afraid with but little success so far. You may trust him, mother." "I do, darling; but I want you to be a wise child, and give no one cause to say a harsh word of you. Remember, the eyes of the parish and congregation are always on a young clergyman. For his Master's sake, as well as for his own, he must give no occasion for fault-finding." "I know, mother, and so does Mr. Gilmour, and acts upon it." "Mind you do not let Miss Chatterton have cause to talk about any of your doings, my child. She represents a little world." "I only wish I could 'let or hinder' Miss Chatterton's tongue from running so fast about everything and everybody. She says it is because she 'feels such an interest in young people.' I wish she would manifest a higher principle instead of so much interest. However, if it will comfort you to know it, Miss Chatterton did not see me at the gate to-day." "Elsie, Elsie, you are incorrigible. You know what I mean. Dear love, do not allow Mr. Gilmour or any one to think you forward." "He does not, mother," and the soft pink deepened into an indignant flush on Elsie's cheek and brow. "It is for the man to seek—" "He does, mother." "For the girl to let herself be followed and—" "I do, dear," interrupted Elsie, and mischief had evidently resumed her reign and mastered the feeling which at first threatened rebellion. The girl laughed merrily after saying the brief monosyllables in a demure tone, and the mother recognised that the replies were only could see mother's face! If I only could see mother's face!" "And maybe you will some day, Willie," said Bessie; "so try to think about that, and how she loves you just the same even if you don't see her. And don't you like to know the blue sky is there, and that Jesus is behind it, looking at you and feeling sorry for you? None of us can see Jesus, but we know he sees us and loves us all the same; don't we? Couldn't you feel a little that way about your mother, Willie?" "I'll try," said Willie, with the old patient smile coming back again. Poor Willie! It was not usual for him to be impatient or fretful. But he had been sadly tried that day in the way he had spoken of, and the longing for his lost sight was almost too great to be borne. But now Mrs. Granby, suspecting something of what was going on on that side of the room, came bustling up to Willie and Bessie, bringing Maggie with her. Maggie had been making acquaintance with Jennie while Bessie was talking with the blind boy. "Willie," said Mrs. Granby, "here's just the prettiest little dog that ever lived, and he is as tame and gentle as can be. If Miss Maggie don't object, maybe he'd lie a bit on your knee, and let you feel his nice long ears and silken hair." "Yes, take him," said Maggie, putting her dog into Willie's arms. Flossy was not usually very willing to go to strangers; but now, perhaps, his doggish instinct told him that this poor boy had need of pity and kindness. However that was, he lay quietly in Willie's clasp, and looking wistfully into his sightless eyes, licked his hands and face. Maggie and Bessie were delighted, and began to tell Willie of Flossy's cunning ways. The other children gathered about to listen and admire too, and presently Willie laughed outright as they told of his cute trick with the crumpled paper. And now, whether Miss Kitty saw through the crack of the drawer that her young master was fondling a new pet, or whether she only guessed at it, or whether she thought it hard that fun should be going on in which she had no share, cannot be told; but just then there came from her prison-place such a hissing and sputtering and scratching that every one of the children set up a shout of laughter. Not since his blindness came upon him had his mother heard Willie's voice sound so gleeful, and now in her heart she blessed the dear little girl who she felt had done him good. Then as the children begged for her, kitty was released; but as she still showed much ill-temper, Mrs. Granby was obliged to put her in the other room. Soon after this our little girls, with their nurse, took leave, having presented Willie with a new book, and his mother with some useful things mamma had sent, and giving Willie and Jennie an invitation to come and see them. They did not go back as joyfully as they had come. Somehow, in spite of the good laugh they had had, the thought of blind Willie made them feel sad, and giving Jane their hooples to carry, they walked quietly by her side, hand in hand. Bessie was half heart-broken as she told her mamma of the blind boy's longing to see his mother's face, and neither she nor Maggie quite recovered their usual spirits for the remainder of the day. Mamma was almost sorry she had allowed them to go. "And what makes my princess so sad this evening?" asked Uncle Ruthven, lifting Bessie upon his knee. "Don't you think you'd be very sad, sir, if you were blind?" "Doubtless I should, dear. I think, of all my senses, my sight is the one I prize most, and for which I am most thankful. But you are not going to lose your sight; are you, Bessie?" "No," said Bessie; "but Willie Richards has lost his. He is quite, quite blind, uncle, and can't see his mother's face; and they can't let the doctor cure him, 'cause they are too poor. Maggie and I wished to help them very much, and we wanted to ask them to take all the glove-money we have,--that is what mamma lets us have to do charity with,--but mamma says it would not be much help, and she thinks we had better keep it to buy some little thing Willie may need. And we are very grieved for him." "Poor little princess!" said Mr. Stanton. "And why did you not come to me for help? What is the good of having an old uncle with plenty of money in his pockets, if you do not make him 'do charity' for you? Let me see. How comes on the history of the 'Complete Family,' Maggie?" "Oh! it's 'most finished," said Maggie. "At least, that book is; but we are going to have another volume. Mamma likes us to write it. She says it is good practice, and will make it easy for us to write compositions by and by." "Very sensible of mamma," said Mr. Stanton. "But I think you said you wished to sell it when it was finished, so that you might help the poor." "Yes, sir." "Well, you know I am going away to-morrow morning,--going to take Aunt Bessie to Baltimore to see her sister. We shall be gone about a week. If your book is finished when we come home, I shall see if I cannot find a purchaser for it. And you might use the money for the blind boy if you like." Just at this moment nurse put her head in at the door with "Come along, my honeys. Your mamma is waiting up-stairs for you, and it's your bed-time." "In one instant, mammy," said Mr. Stanton. "Is it a bargain, little ones? If I find a man to buy your book, will you have it ready, and trust it to me, when I come back?" The children were willing enough to agree to this; and Maggie only wished that it was not bed-time, so that she might finish the book that very night. Uncle Ruthven said they would talk more about it when he returned, and bade them "Good-night." "My darlings," said mamma, when they went up-stairs, "I do not want you to distress yourselves about blind Willie. When the time comes for the doctor to perform the operation on his eyes, I think the means will be found to pay him. But you are not to say anything about it at present. I only tell you because I do not like to see you unhappy." "Are you or papa going to do it, mamma?" asked Bessie. "We shall see," said Mrs. Bradford, with a smile. "Perhaps we can help you a little," said Maggie, joyfully; and she told her mother of her uncle's proposal about the book. [Illustration: Title decoration, chap. 12] XII. _MAGGIE'S BOOK._ Uncle Ruthven and Aunt Bessie went away the next morning, and were gone nearly a week, and very much did the children miss them, especially as the week proved one of storm and rain, and they were shut up in the house. During all this stormy weather Aunt Patty seemed very anxious to go out, watching for the first glimpse of sunshine. But none came, and at last, one morning when there was a fine, drizzling rain, she came down dressed for a walk. Mrs. Bradford was much astonished, for Mrs. Lawrence was subject to rheumatism, and it was very imprudent for her to go out in the damp. In vain did Mrs. Bradford offer to send a servant on any errand she might wish to have done. Aunt Patty would not listen to it for a moment, nor would she allow a carriage to be sent for, nor tell where she was going. She stayed a long time, and when the boys ran home from school in the midst of a hard shower, they were surprised to meet her just getting out of a carriage which had drawn up around the corner. Aunt Patty did not seem at all pleased to see them, and in answer to their astonished inquiries, "Why, Aunt Patty! where have you been?" and "Why don't you let the carriage leave you at the house?" answered, sharply, "When I was young, old people could mind their own affairs without help from school-boys." "Not without help from school-_girls_, when _she_ was around, I guess," whispered Fred to his brother, as they fell behind, and let the old lady march on. Nor was she more satisfactory when she reached home, and seemed only desirous to avoid Mrs. Bradford's kind inquiries and anxiety lest she should have taken cold. This was rather strange, for it was not Aunt Patty's way to be mysterious, and she was generally quite ready to let her actions be seen by the whole world. But certainly no one would have guessed from her manner that she had that morning been about her Master's work. Uncle Ruthven and Aunt Bessie came home that afternoon, and found no reason to doubt their welcome. "We're very glad to see you, Uncle Er-er _R_uthven," said Bessie, bringing out the _R_ quite clearly. "Hallo!" said her uncle, "so you have come to it at last; have you? You have been learning to talk English while I was away. Pretty well for my princess! What reward shall I give you for that _R_uthven?" "I don't want a reward," said the little princess, gayly. "I tried to learn it 'cause I thought you wanted me to; and you are so kind to us I wanted to please you. Besides, I am growing pretty old, and I ought to learn to talk plain. Why, Uncle Ruthven, I'll be six years old when I have a birthday in May, and the other day we saw a little girl,--she was blind Willie's sister,--and she couldn't say _th_, though she is 'most seven; and I thought it sounded pretty foolish; and then I thought maybe it sounded just as foolish for me not to say _r_, so I tried and tried, and Maggie helped me." "Uncle Ruthven," said Maggie, coming to his side, and putting her arm about his neck, she whispered in his ear, "did you ever find a man to buy my book?" "To be sure," said Mr. Stanton, "a first-rate fellow, who promised to take it at once. He would like to know how much you want for it?" "I don't know," said Maggie; "how much can he afford?" "Ah! you answer my question by another. Well, he is pretty well off, that fellow, and I think he will give you sufficient to help along that blind friend of yours a little. We will not talk of that just now, however, but when you go up-stairs, I will come up and see you, and we will settle it all then." "Here is a prize," said Mr. Stanton, coming into the parlor some hours later, when the children had all gone; and he held up Maggie's history of the "Complete Family." "What is that?" asked Colonel Rush, who with his wife had come to welcome his sister. Mr. Stanton told the story of the book. "But how came it into your hands?" asked Mr. Bradford. "Oh, Maggie and I struck a bargain to-night," said Mr. Stanton, laughing, "and the book is mine to do as I please with." "Oh, Ruthven, Ruthven!" said his sister, coming in as he spoke, and passing her hand affectionately through his thick, curly locks, "you have made two happy hearts to-night. Nor will the stream of joy you have set flowing stop with my little ones. That poor blind child and his parents--" "There, there, that will do," said Mr. Stanton, playfully putting his hand on Mrs. Bradford's lips. "Sit down here, Margaret. I shall give you all some passages from Maggie's book. If I am not mistaken, it will be a rich treat." Poor little Maggie! She did not dream, as she lay happy and contented on her pillow, how merry they were all making over her "Complete Family," as Uncle Ruthven read aloud from it such passages as these. "The Happy father and mother brought up their children in the way they should go, but sometimes the children went out of it, which was not the blame of their kind parents, for they knew better, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves, and it is a great blessing for children to have parents. "The colonel had a new leg, not a skin one, but a man made it, but you would not know it, it looks so real, and he can walk with it and need not take his crutches, and the souls of M. and B. Happy were very glad because this was a great rejoicing, and it is not a blessing to be lame, but to have two legs is, and when people have a great many blessings, they ought to 'praise God from whom all blessings flow;' but they don't always, which is very wicked. "This very Complete Family grew completer and completer, for the travelling uncle married Aunt Bessie, I mean he is going to marry her, so she will be our own aunt and not just a make b'lieve, and all the family are very glad and are very much obliged to him for being so kind, but I don't think he is a great sacrifice. "M. and B. Happy went to see the policeman's children. Blind Willie was sorrowful and can't see his mother, or anything, which is no consequence, if he could see his mother's face, for if M. Happy and B. Happy could not see dear mamma's face they would cry all the time. I mean M. would, but Bessie is better than me so maybe she would not, and Willie is very patient, and the cat was very abominable, and if Flossy did so, Bessie and I would be disgraced of him. She humped up her back and was cross, so Mrs. Granby put her in the drawer, but she put a paw out of the crack and spit and scratched and did 'most everything. Oh! such a bad cat!!!!!! Jennie she cannot say th, and afterwards I laughed about it, but Bessie said I ought not, because she cannot say r and that was 'most the same. And she is going to try and say Uncle Ruthven's name quite plain and hard, he is so very good to us, and he promised to find a man to buy this book, and we hope the man will give five dollars to be a great help for blind Willie's doctor. I suppose he will ask everybody in the cars if they want to buy a book to print, that somebody of his wrote, but he is not going to tell our name because I asked him not to." The book ended in this way:-- "These are not all the acts of the Complete Family, but there will be another book with some more. Adieu. And if you don't know French, that means good-by. The end of the book!" "Pretty well for seven years old, I think," said Mr. Bradford. "Mamma, did you lend a helping hand?" "Only to correct the spelling," said Mrs. Bradford; "the composition and ideas are entirely Maggie's own, with a little help from Bessie. I have not interfered save once or twice when she has chosen some subject I did not think it best she should write on. Both she and Bessie have taken so much pleasure in it that I think it would have been a real trial to part with the book except for some such object as they have gained." "And what is that?" asked Colonel Rush. "The sum Dr. Dawson asks for the cure of Willie Richards," answered Mrs. Bradford, "which sum this dear brother of mine is allowing to pass through the hands of these babies of mine, as their gift to the blind child." "Aunt Patty," said Bessie at the breakfast-table the next morning,--"Aunt Patty, did you hear what Uncle Ruthven did for us?" "Yes, I heard," said the old lady, shortly. "And don't you feel very happy with us?" asked the little darling, who was anxious that every one should rejoice with herself and Maggie; but she spoke more timidly than she had done at first, and something of her old fear of Aunt Patty seemed to come over her. "I do not think it at all proper that children should be allowed to have such large sums of money," said Mrs. Lawrence, speaking not to Bessie, but to Mrs. Bradford. "I thought your brother a more sensible man, Margaret. Such an ill-judged thing!" Mrs. Bradford was vexed, as she saw the bright face of her little daughter become overcast, still she tried to speak pleasantly. Something had evidently gone wrong with Aunt Patty. "I do not think you will find Ruthven wanting in sense or judgment, Aunt Patty," she said, gently. "And the sum you speak of is for a settled purpose. It only passes through my children's hands, and is not theirs to waste or spend as they may please." "And if it was, we would rather give it to blind Willie, mamma," said Bessie, in a grieved and half-angry voice. "I am sure of it, my darling," said mamma, with a nod and smile which brought comfort to the disappointed little heart. Ah, the dear mamma! they were all sure of sympathy from her whether in joy or sorrow. Aunt Patty's want of it had been particularly hard on Bessie, for the dear child saw the old lady did not look half pleased that morning, and she had spoken as much from a wish to cheer her as for her own sake and Maggie's. "It is all wrong, decidedly wrong!" continued Mrs. Lawrence. "In my young days things were very different. Children were not then allowed to take the lead in every way, and to think they could do it as well or better than their elders. The proper thing for you to do, Margaret, is to put by that money till your children are older and better able to judge what they are doing." "I think they understand that now, Aunt Patty," said Mrs. Bradford, quietly, but firmly; "and if they should not, I suppose you will allow that their parents are able to judge for them. Henry and I understand all the merits of the present case." Aunt Patty was not to be convinced, and she talked for some time, growing more and more vexed as she saw her words had no effect. Mr. and Mrs. Bradford were silent, for they knew it was of no use to argue with the old lady when she was in one of these moods; but they wished that the meal was at an end, and the children were out of hearing. And there sat Miss Rush, too, wondering and indignant, and only kept from replying to Aunt Patty by Mrs. Bradford's beseeching look. But at last Mr. Bradford's patience was at an end, and in a firm, decided manner, he requested the old lady to say nothing more on the subject, but to leave it to be settled by his wife and himself. If there was any person in the world of whom Mrs. Lawrence stood in awe, it was her nephew; and she knew when he spoke in that tone, he meant to be obeyed. Therefore, she was silent, but sat through the remainder of breakfast with a dark and angry face. "Papa," said Maggie, as her father rose from the table, "do you think there is the least, least hope that it will clear to-day?" "Well, I see some signs of it, dear; but these April days are very uncertain. Of one thing be sure, if the weather be at all fit, I will come home and take you where you want to go." "Are you tired of being shut up in the house so long, dear Midget?" asked Aunt Bessie, putting her arm about Maggie, and drawing her to her side. "Yes, pretty tired, Aunt Bessie; but that is not the reason why Bessie and I wish so very much to have it clear. Papa told us, if the weather was pleasant, he would take us to the policeman's, and let us give the money ourselves. But he says, if it keeps on raining, he thinks it would be better to send it, because it is not kind to keep them waiting when they feel so badly about Willie, and this will make them so glad. I suppose it is not very kind, but we want very much to take it, and see Mrs. Richards how pleased she will be." "We will hope for the best," said Mr. Bradford, cheerfully; "and I think it may turn out a pleasant day. But my little daughters must not be too much disappointed if the rain keeps on. And now that I may be ready for clear skies and dry pavements, I must go down town at once." No sooner had the door closed after Mr. Bradford than Aunt Patty broke forth again. "Margaret," she said, severely, "it is not possible that you mean to add to your folly by letting your children go to that low place, after such weather as we have had! You don't know what you may expose them to, especially that delicate child, whom you can never expect to be strong while you are so shamefully careless of her;" and she looked at Bessie, who felt very angry. "That will be as their father thinks best," answered Mrs. Bradford, quietly. "He will not take them unless the weather is suitable; and the policeman's house is neat and comfortable, and in a decent neighborhood. The children will come to no harm there." "And it is certainly going to clear," said Harry. "See there, mamma, how it is brightening overhead." "It will not clear for some hours at least," persisted the old lady; "and then the ground will be extremely damp after this week of rain, especially among those narrow streets. Do be persuaded, Margaret, and say, at least, that the children must wait till to-morrow." "Bessie shall not go unless it is quite safe for her," answered Mrs. Bradford, "and she will not ask it unless mamma thinks it best; will you, my darling?" Bessie only replied with a smile, and a very feeble smile at that; and her mother saw by the crimson spot in each cheek, and the little hand pressed tightly upon her lips, how hard the dear child was struggling with herself. It was so. Bessie was hurt at what she thought Aunt Patty's unkindness in trying to deprive her of the pleasure on which she counted, and she had hard work to keep down the rising passion. Aunt Patty argued, persisted, and persuaded; but she could gain from Mrs. Bradford nothing more than she had said before, and at last she left the room in high displeasure. "Mamma," said Harry, indignantly, "what do you stand it for? How dare she talk so to you? Your folly, indeed! I wish papa had been here!" "I wish you'd let me hush her up," said Fred. "It's rather hard for a fellow to stand by and have his mother spoken to that way. Now is she not a meddling, aggravating old coon, Aunt Bessie? No, you need not shake your head in that grave, reproving way. I know you think so; and you, too, you dear, patient little mamma;" and here Fred gave his mother such a squeeze and kiss as would have made any one else cry out for mercy. "I sha'n't try to bear Aunt Patty's burden this day, I know," said Maggie. "She is _too_ mean not to want blind Willie cured, and it is not any of hers to talk about, either. Her corners are awful to-day! Just trying to make mamma say Bessie couldn't go to the policeman's house!" Bessie said nothing, but her mamma saw she was trying to keep down her angry feelings. "I suppose she is tired of the 'new leaf' she pretended to have turned over, and don't mean to play good girl any more," said Fred. "She has been worrying papa too," said Harry. "There is never any knowing what she'll be at. There was a grove which used to belong to her father, and which had been sold by one of her brothers after he died. It was a favorite place with our great-grandfather, and Aunt Patty wanted it back very much, but she never could persuade the man who had bought it to give it up. A few years ago he died, and his son offered to sell it to her. She could not afford it then, for she had lost a great deal of property, and the mean chap asked a very large sum for it because he knew she wanted it so much. But she was determined to have it, and for several years she has been putting by little by little till she should have enough. She told Fred and me all about it, one evening when papa and mamma were out, and we felt so sorry for her when she told how her father had loved the place, and how she could die contented if she only had it back once more after all these years, that we asked papa if he could not help her. Papa said he would willingly do so, but she would not be pleased if he offered, though she had so set her heart on it that she was denying herself everything she could possibly do without; for she is not well off now, and is too proud to let her friends help her Well, it seems she had enough laid by at last,--a thousand dollars,--and she asked papa to settle it all for her. He wrote to the man, and had a lot of fuss and bother with him; but it was all fixed at last, and the papers drawn up, when what does she do a week ago, but tell papa she had changed her mind, and should not buy the grove at present." "Harry, my boy," said Mrs. Bradford, "this is all so, but how do you happen to know so much about it?" "Why, she talked to me several times about it, mamma. She was quite chipper with Fred and me now and then, when no grown people were around, and used to tell us stories of things which happened at the old homestead by the hour. The other day when you were out, and Mag and Bess had gone to the policeman's, she told me it was all settled that she was to have the grove; and she seemed so happy over it. But only two days after, when I said something about it, she took me up quite short, and told me that affair was all over, and no more to be said. I didn't dare to ask any more questions of her, but I thought it no harm to ask papa, and he told me he knew no more than I did, for Aunt Patty would give him no reason. He was dreadfully annoyed by it, I could see, although he did not say much; he never does, you know, when he is vexed." "Quite true," said his mother; "and let him be an example to the rest of us. We have all forgotten ourselves a little in the vexations of the morning. You have been saying that which was better left unsaid, and your mother has done wrong in listening to you." "No, indeed, you have not," said Fred, again clutching his mother violently about the neck; "you never do wrong, you dear, precious mamma, and I'll stand up for you against all the cross old Aunt Pattys in creation." "My dear boy," gasped his mother, "if you could leave my head on, it would be a greater convenience than fighting on my account with Aunt Patty. And your mother must be very much on her guard, Fred, if a thing is to be judged right by you because she does it. But, dearest children, did we not all determine not to allow ourselves to be irritated and vexed by such things as have taken place this morning? This is almost the first trial of the kind we have had. Let us be patient and forgiving, and try to think no more of it." But it was in vain that Mrs. Bradford coaxed and persuaded, and even reproved. Her children obeyed, and were silent when she forbade any more to be said on the subject; but she could not do away with the impression which Aunt Patty's ill-temper and interference had made. Poor Aunt Patty! She had practised a great piece of self-denial, had given up a long-cherished hope, that she might have the means of doing a very kind action; but she did not choose to have it known by her friends. And having made up her mind to this, and given up so much to bring it about, it did seem hard that her arrangements should be interfered with, as they seemed likely to be by this new plan which had come to her ears the night before. But now as she stood alone in her own room, taking herself to task for the ill-temper she had just shown, she felt that it would be still harder for the children; she could not allow them to be disappointed if it were still possible to prevent it; that would be too cruel now that she saw so plainly how much they had set their hearts upon this thing. At first it had seemed to her, as she said, much better that they should put by the money until they were older, but now she saw it was the desire to carry out her own will which had led her to think this. But Aunt Patty was learning to give up her own will, slowly and with difficulty it might be, with many a struggle, many a failure, as had been shown this morning; but still, thanks to the whispers of the better spirit by whose teachings she had lately been led, she was taking to heart the lesson so hard to learn because so late begun. And now how was she to undo what she had done, so that Maggie and Bessie might still keep this matter in their own hands? For Aunt Patty, hearing the little ones talk so much of the blind boy and his parents, had become quite interested in the policeman's family. She did not know them, it was true, had never seen one of them, but the children's sympathy had awakened hers, and she felt a wish to do something to help them; but to do this to much purpose was not very easy for Mrs. Lawrence. She was not rich, and what she gave to others she must take from her own comforts and pleasures. What a good thing it would be to pay Dr. Dawson and free the policeman from debt! What happiness this would bring to those poor people! What pleasure it would give little Maggie and Bessie! But how could she do it? She had not the means at present, unless, indeed, she put off the purchase of the grove for a year or two, and took part of the sum she had so carefully laid by for that purpose, and if she did so, she might never have back the grove. She was very old, had not probably many years to live, and she might pass away before the wished-for prize was her own. And these people were nothing to her; why should she make such a sacrifice for them? So thought Aunt Patty, and then said to herself, if she had but a short time upon earth, was there not more reason that she should spend it in doing all she could for her Master's service, in helping those of his children on whom he had laid pain and sorrows? She had been wishing that she might be able to prove her love and gratitude for the great mercy that had been shown to her, that she might yet redeem the wasted years, the misspent life which lay behind her, and now when the Lord had given her the opportunity for which she had been longing, should she turn her back upon it, should she shut her ear to the cry of the needy, because to answer it would cost a sacrifice of her own wishes? Should she bear the burdens of others only when they did not weigh heavily on herself? And so the old lady had gone to Dr. Dawson and paid him the sum he asked for curing Willie's eyes. What more she had done will be shown hereafter. If the children had known this, perhaps they could have guessed why she would not buy the grove after all papa's trouble. There were several reasons why Mrs. Lawrence had chosen to keep all this a secret; partly from a really honest desire not to parade her generosity in the eyes of men, partly because she thought that Mr. Bradford might oppose it, and fearing the strength of her own resolution, she did not care to have it shaken by any persuasions to the contrary, and partly because she had always rather prided herself on carrying out her own plans without help or advice from others. This fear that she might be tempted to change her purpose had also made Aunt Patty so anxious to bring it to an end at once, and had taken her out in the rain on the day before this. And now it seemed that her trouble so far as regarded Dr. Dawson was all thrown away. But the question was, how should she get the money back from the doctor without betraying herself to him or some of the family? for this Aunt Patty was quite determined not to do. It was not a pleasant task to ask him to return the money she had once given, and that without offering any reason save that she had changed her mind. Every limb was aching with the cold taken from her exposure of yesterday, and now if she was to be in time, she must go out again in the damp. True, it was not raining now, but there was another heavy cloud coming up in the south; she should surely be caught in a fresh shower. If she could have persuaded Mrs. Bradford to keep the children at home until the next day, she could go to Dr. Dawson that afternoon if the weather were clear, and so escape another wetting. For the doctor had told her he did not think he could see the policeman before the evening of that day. But Margaret was "obstinate," said the old lady, forgetting that she herself was a little obstinate in keeping all this a secret. So there was nothing for it but to go at once. Poor old lady! Perhaps it was not to be wondered at that, as she moved about the room, making ready to go out, she should again feel irritable and out of humor. She was in much pain. The plans which had cost her so much, and which she had thought would give such satisfaction, were all disarranged. She was vexed at being misjudged by those from whom she had so carefully concealed what she had done, for she saw plainly enough that they all thought her opposition of the morning was owing to the spirit of contradiction she had so often shown. She was vexed at herself, vexed with Mrs. Bradford, vexed even with the little ones whom she could not allow to be disappointed, and just for the moment she could not make up her mind to be reasonable and look at things in their right light. Nor were her troubles yet at an end. As she left the room, she met Mrs. Bradford, who, seeing that she was going out again, once more tried to dissuade her from such imprudence, but all to no purpose. Aunt Patty was very determined and rather short, and went on her way down-stairs. As Mrs. Bradford entered her nursery, mammy, who had heard all that had passed, said, with the freedom of an old and privileged servant,-- "Eh, my dear, but she's contrary. She's just hunting up a fit of rheumatics, that you may have the trouble of nursing her through it." Mrs. Lawrence heard the old woman's improper speech, but did not hear Mrs. Bradford's gently spoken reproof, and we may be sure the first did not help to restore her good-humor. [Illustration: decoration, end of chap. 12] [Illustration: Title decoration, chap. 13] XIII. _DISAPPOINTMENT._ Bessie's high spirits had all flown away. The scene with Aunt Patty, and the fear that the weather would not allow Maggie and herself to carry Uncle Ruthven's gift to blind Willie, on which pleasure, in spite of her father's warning, she had quite set her mind, were enough to sadden that sensitive little heart. More than this, she was very much hurt at what Aunt Patty had said of her mother. _She_, that dear, precious mamma, always so tender and devoted, so careful of her by night and day, to be so spoken of! No one else had ever dared to speak so to mamma in her hearing, and she did not feel as if she could forgive it. Poor little soul! she was very indignant, but she kept down her anger, and all she had allowed herself to say had been, "She would not like to be blind herself a whole year; but she has not a bit of _symphethy_." At which long word mamma could not help smiling; but as she looked at the grieved face, she felt as if she could scarcely keep her own patience. "Come here, Bessie," said Miss Rush, who was sitting by the window, "I have something to show you; see there," as Bessie climbed upon her lap. "A few moments since I saw a break in the clouds, and a bit of blue sky peeping out. I did not call you right away, lest you should be disappointed again; but the blue is spreading and spreading, so I think we may hope for a fine day, after all. And see, there is the sun struggling through. Ah, I think you will have your walk with papa." Yes, there came the sun shining quite brightly now, and the pools of water on the sidewalk began to dance in his beams as if they were saying, "How do you do, Mr. Sun? We are glad to see you after a week's absence, even though you do mean to make us disappear beneath your warm rays." Bessie watched for a few moments, and then ran to find Maggie, who had gone up-stairs with mamma for a new story-book which Aunt Bessie had promised to read for them. "Maggie, Maggie!" she called from the foot of the stairs, "come and see how the blue sky is coming out and how the sun is shining;" and as she spoke, Maggie ran along the upper hall, and came down, saying, dolefully,-- "Oh, Bessie! I saw it up-stairs, and I went to the window to look, and there's a great cloud coming over the sun. There, see! he's all gone now. I just believe it is going to rain again." It was too true, and as the little girls ran to the front-door, and Maggie drew aside the lace which covered the large panes of glass in the upper part, so that they might peep out, they saw that the blue sky had disappeared, and a moment later, down splashed the heavy drops of rain. Bessie felt a great choking in her throat, and Maggie said, impatiently, "It is _never_ going to clear up; I know it. It just rains this way to provoke poor children who want to go out." "Maggie, darling, who sends the rain?" came in Aunt Bessie's gentle tone through the open parlor-door, and at the same moment a stern voice behind the children said,-- "You are very naughty, child. Do you remember that God hears you when you say such wicked words?" Both children turned with a start to see Mrs. Lawrence in hat and cloak, and with an enormous umbrella in her hand. "No," she said, severely, as poor frightened Maggie shrank before the glance of her eye, "you will not go out to-day, nor do you deserve it." Then Bessie's anger broke forth. "You are bad, you're cruel!" she said, stamping her foot, and with her face crimson with passion. "You want poor Willie to be blind all his life. You don't want him to be well, even when our Father--" What more she would have said will never be known, save by Him who reads all hearts; for as these last two words passed her lips, she checked herself, and rushing to Aunt Bessie, who had gone to the parlor-door at the sound of Mrs. Lawrence's voice, buried her face in the folds of her dress. "Our Father!" Was she his little child now when in her fury and passion she had forgotten that his holy eye rested upon her, when she was grieving and offending him? Such was the thought that had stopped her, even as she poured forth those angry words. For one moment she stood with her face hidden, sending up a silent, hurried prayer to the Great Helper, then turning to Aunt Patty, she said, with a touching meekness,-- "Please forgive me, Aunt Patty. I didn't try hard enough that time; but I'll try not to do so again. The wicked passion came so quick;" and then she hid her face once more against Miss Rush. Yes, the passion had come quickly, but it had been quickly conquered, and as Aunt Patty looked at her, these words came to her mind: "Greater is he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city;" and she stood humbled before this little child. Turning away without a word, she opened the front-door and passed out, while Miss Rush led the children back to the parlor. Aunt Bessie's own eyes glistened as she lifted the sobbing child upon her lap, while Maggie stood beside her, holding Bessie's hand in one of her own, and with her pocket-handkerchief wiping the tears that streamed from her little sister's eyes. "Oh, it has been such a bad day, and we thought it was going to be such a nice one, didn't we?" said Bessie. "We were so very glad when we woke up this morning, and we have had such very _misable_ times all day, and now I was so naughty. And I did ask for help to be good, too, this morning. Aunt Bessie, why didn't it come?" "I think it did come, darling," said Aunt Bessie. "If it had not, you could not have conquered yourself as you did the moment you remembered you were displeasing your heavenly Father. If you forgot for a moment, and your temper overcame you, I think he knew how you had struggled with it this morning, and so pitied and forgave, sending the grace and strength you needed as soon as you saw your own want of it." "It's all Aunt Patty's fault, anyhow," said Maggie. "She provoked us, hateful old thing! I know I ought not to say that about the rain, Aunt Bessie, 'cause it's God's rain, and he can send it if he chooses; but it was not her business to meddle about, and I am a great deal more sorry for your speaking so kind than for all the scolding. I just wish--I wish--" "I would not wish any bad wishes for Aunt Patty, dear," said Miss Rush. "That will not help any of us to feel better." "I don't know about that," said Maggie, gravely shaking her head. "I think I'd feel more comfortable in my mind if I wished something about her. I think I'll have to do it, Aunt Bessie." "Then wish only that she were a little more amiable, or did not speak quite so sharply," said Miss Rush, smiling at Maggie's earnestness. "Oh, pooh! that's no good," said Maggie. "She never will learn to behave herself. I'll tell you, I just wish she was a Lot's wife." "Lot's wife?" said Miss Rush. "I mean Lot's wife after she 'came a pillar of salt, and then maybe she'd be all soaked away in this pouring rain, and no more left of her to come back again and bother us." There was never any telling where Maggie's ideas would carry her, and at the thought of the droll fate she had imagined for Aunt Patty, Miss Rush fairly laughed outright, and even Bessie smiled, after which she said she would go up-stairs and talk a little to her mother, which always did her good when she was in trouble. This shower proved the last of the rain for that day, and by twelve o'clock the clouds had all rolled away and the pavements were drying rapidly, giving fresh hope to Maggie and Bessie that they would be able to go over to the policeman's house; but before that Aunt Patty had returned. She was very silent, almost sad, and the many troubled looks she cast towards the little girls made Mrs. Bradford think that she was sorry for her unkindness of the morning. This was so, but there was more than that to trouble the old lady, for her errand to Dr. Dawson had been fruitless. When she reached his house, he was out, but she sat down to wait for him. He soon came in and without waiting for her to speak, told her that, having an hour to spare, he had just been up to the police-station to give Richards the good news. So it was too late after all, for now that the policeman knew of her gift, Mrs. Lawrence could not make up her mind to ask it back. Then the doctor asked her if she had any further business with him, to which she answered "No," and walked away, leaving him to think what a very odd old lady she was, and to say indignantly that he believed "she had not trusted him, and had come to see that he kept faith with her." "Bradford," said Mr. Stanton, as he stood in his brother-in-law's office that morning, "those dear little girls of yours have put me to shame with their lively, earnest desire to do good to others. Here have I been leading this lazy, useless life ever since I came home, looking only to my own comfort and happiness; and in my want of thought for others scarcely deserving the overflowing share of both which has fallen to me. Your little ones have given me a lesson in their innocent wish to extend to others the benefits which God has heaped upon them; now cannot you help me to put it into practice? I am still so much of a stranger in my own city that I should scarcely know where to begin the task of carrying help to those who need it; but you were always a hand to know the claims and deserts of the poor. I have, thank God, the means and the time; can you show me where I can best spend them?" "Doubtless, my dear fellow," answered Mr. Bradford. "I think you are rather hard upon yourself; but I can show you where both time and money can be laid out with a certainty of doing good and bringing happiness to those who deserve them. Just now--But how far do your benevolent intentions go?" "Tell me the necessities of your _protegée_ or _protegées_," said Mr. Stanton, smiling, "and I will tell you how far I am inclined to satisfy them. I had not thought much about it, having just been roused to a sense that it was time I was doing somewhat for the welfare of those who are not as well off as myself." "I was about to say," continued Mr. Bradford, "that at present I know of no more worthy case than that of the father of the blind boy in whom my children are so much interested. If an honest, God-fearing heart, a trusting, cheerful, yet submissive spirit, can give him a claim upon our help and sympathy, he certainly possesses it. I have watched him and talked to him during the last few months with considerable interest, and I honestly believe his troubles have not arisen through any fault of his own, but through the dealings of Providence. He has been sorely tried, poor fellow, and I should like to see him set right once more with the world, free from the pressure of debt, and able to save his earnings for the comfort of his family. I had intended to undertake the payment of Dr. Dawson for the treatment of Willie's eyes, but since you have done this, I shall hand to Richards the sum I had intended for that purpose. Whatever you may choose to add to this, will be so much towards relieving him from his debt to this Schwitz." "And how much is that?" asked Mr. Stanton. Mr. Bradford named the sum, and after hearing all the circumstances, Mr. Stanton drew a check for the amount needed to pay the rest of the debt to Dr. Schwitz, and gave it to his brother-in-law, asking him to hand it to the policeman with his own gift. "You had better come with us this afternoon, and see for yourself," said Mr. Bradford. "It is going to be fine, and I have promised those dear little things that they shall carry their prize to the blind boy's home. I believe we are likely to find Richards there about three o'clock, and I should like you to know him." So Mr. Stanton was persuaded; and as Maggie and Bessie were watching eagerly from the window for the first glimpse of papa, they saw him coming up the street with Uncle Ruthven. When they were ready to go, those three precious notes, the price of Willie's sight, were brought by Maggie to her father, with many prayers that he would take the best of care of them. She was not satisfied till she had seen them in his pocket-book, where she herself squeezed them into the smallest possible corner, next thrusting the pocket-book into the very depths of his pockets, and ramming in his handkerchief on top of that, "to be sure to keep it all safe." But there was a sore disappointment in store for these poor children. As they were leaving the house, and before Mr. Bradford had closed the door behind them, who should appear at the foot of the steps but Sergeant Richards himself, with his broad, honest face in a glow of happiness and content. "Ah! Richards, how are you?" said Mr. Bradford. "At your service, sir," answered the policeman, politely touching his cap. "I just came round to say a word to you, but I see you are going out. I sha'n't detain you two moments, though, if you could spare me that." "Willingly," said Mr. Bradford. "We were on our way to your house, but our errand will keep;" and he led the way back to the parlor, followed by the whole party. Mrs. Bradford and Miss Rush were there also, just ready to go out; while Aunt Patty sat in the library, where every word that passed in the front room must reach her ears. "No, I'll not sit down, thank you, sir," said the policeman, "and I'll not keep you long. You have been so kind to me, and taken such an interest in all my difficulties, that I felt as if I must come right up and tell you of the good fortune, or, I should say, the kind Providence, which has fallen to me. I have been furnished with the means to pay my debt to Dr. Schwitz; and more, thank God! more than this, Dr. Dawson has received the amount of his charge for the operation on Willie's eyes. I shall be able to hold up my head once more, and that with the chance of my boy having his sight again." "And how has this come about?" asked Mr. Bradford. "I cannot say, sir. Some unknown friend has done it all; but who, I know no more than yourself, perhaps not so much;" and the policeman looked searchingly into Mr. Bradford's face. "And I know absolutely nothing," said the gentleman, smiling. "I see, Richards, you thought I had some hand in it, and expected to find me out; but I assure you, it is not my doing. These little girls of mine had, through the kindness of their uncle, hoped to place in your hands the sum needed for Dr. Dawson, and it was for this purpose that we were on our way to your house; but you say some one has been beforehand with us." "That's so, sir," said Richards; "but none the less am I most grateful to you and the little ladies and this kind gentleman for your generous intentions. I am sure I don't know what I have done that the Lord should raise me up such friends. But it is most strange as to who could have done this, sir, and about that old lady." "What old lady?" asked Mr. Bradford. "Why, sir, she who either has done this or has been sent by some one else. If I don't keep you too long, I should just like to tell you what I know." "Not at all," said Mr. Bradford. "Let us have the story." "Yesterday morning," said the policeman, "Mrs. Granby was sitting by the window, when she saw an old lady going to 'most all the houses, and seeming to be asking her way or inquiring for some one. So Mrs. Granby puts out her head and asks if she was looking for any one. 'I want Mrs. Richards, the policeman's wife,' says the old lady. Mrs. Granby told her that was the place and opens the door for her. Well, she walked in, but a stranger she was, to be sure; neither my wife nor Mrs. Granby ever set eyes on her before, and they did not know what to make of her. All sorts of questions she asked, and in a way Mary did not like at all, never telling who she was or what she came for. Well, after a while she went away, but never letting on what she had come for, and Mrs. Granby and Mary set it down that it was only for spying and meddling. But last night when I took up the Bible to read a chapter before we went to bed, out drops a sealed packet with my name printed on it. I opened it, and there, will you believe it, sir, were two one hundred dollar bills, and around them a slip of paper with the words, printed, too, 'Pay your debts.' No more, no less. You may know if we were astonished, and as for my wife, she was even a bit frightened. After talking it over, we were sure it could have been no one but the old lady that had put it there. But who was she, and how did she know so much of my affairs? Mrs. Granby said she remembered to have seen her fussing with the leaves of the Bible, sort of careless like, as it lay upon the table, and she must have slipped it in then. But whether it was her own gift, or whether she was sent by some one else, who does not care to be seen in the matter, I don't know. The women will have it that it was the last, and that she did not like her errand, and so eased her mind by a bit of fault-finding and meddling, and I must say it looks like it." "And you have no possible clew to who this person was, Richards?" asked Mr. Bradford. "None, sir. I might track her easy, I suppose, but since she didn't seem to wish it to be known who she was or where she came from, I wouldn't feel it was showing my gratitude for the obligations she's laid me under, and you see by the printing she don't wish to be tracked even by her handwriting. Nor was this all. Early this morning, round comes Dr. Dawson to the station, asking for me; and he told me that an old lady had been to his house yesterday, and after asking a lot of questions, had paid him a hundred and fifty dollars for undertaking the operation on Willie's eyes, and took a receipted bill from him. By all accounts, she must be the same person who was at my place yesterday, and if ever a man was as mad as a hornet, he's the one. When he asked if he might take the liberty of inquiring what interest she had in my family, she asked if it was necessary to Willie's cure that he should know that; and when he said, 'No, of course not,' she said it _was_ a great liberty, and as good as told him to mind his own affairs. He quite agrees with my wife and Mrs. Granby that she was only a messenger from some unknown friend, and that she was not pleased with the business she had in hand. The doctor is very much occupied just now, and told her he could not well see me before this evening; but he found he could make time to run over and tell me this morning, and kindly did so. So, you see, sir, I do not rightly know what to do, joyful and grateful as I feel; and I thought I would just run over and tell you the story at once, and ask if you thought I might safely use this money without fear of getting into any difficulty. You see it's such a strange and mysterious way of doing things that I won't say but I would think it odd myself if I heard another person had come by such a sum in such a way." "I see no possible objection to your using the money," said Mr. Bradford. "It certainly has been intended for you, however singular the way in which it has been conveyed to you, or however disagreeable the manner of the messenger. It has probably been the work of some eccentric, but kind-hearted person who does not choose to have his good deeds known." "I can't say but I would feel better to know whom it came from, Mr. Bradford, grateful from my very soul as I am. I shouldn't have been too proud to take such a favor from one who I knew was a friend to me, with the hope, maybe, of one day making it up, but it's not so comfortable to have it done in this secret sort of way, and as if it were something to be ashamed of." "Do during the last few minutes, for she had taken no notice of what was said, but she roused up now, and answered:— “A vegetable out of its place.” “A _vegetable_,” repeated No. 5, “why we don’t eat them, Aunt Judy.” “You kitchen-garden interpreter, who said we did?” replied she. “All green herbs are _vegetables_, let me tell you, whether we eat them or not.” “Oh, I see,” mused No. 5, quietly enough, but in another instant he broke out again. “I’ll tell you what though, some of them are real vegetables, I mean kitchen-garden vegetables, to other creatures, and that’s why they’re wanted. Groundsel’s a vegetable, it’s the canary’s vegetable. I mean his kitchen-garden vegetable, and if he had a kitchen-garden of his own, he would grow it as we do peas. So I was right after all, No. 6!” That _twit_ at the end spoilt everything, otherwise this was really a bright idea of No. 5’s. “Aunt Judy, do begin to talk yourself,” entreated No. 6. “I wish No. 5 would be quiet, and not teaze.” “And he wishes the same of you,” replied Aunt Judy, “and I wish the same of you all. What is to be done? Come, I will tell you a story, on one positive understanding, namely, that whoever teazes, or even _twits_, shall be turned out of the company.” No. 5 sat up in his chair like a dart in an instant, and vowed that he would be the best of the good, till Aunt Judy had finished her story. “After which—” concluded he, with a wink and another grin. “After which, I shall expect you to be better still,” was Aunt Judy’s emphatic rejoinder. And peace being now completely established, she commenced: “There was once upon a time—what do you think?”—here she paused and looked round in the children’s faces. “A giant!” exclaimed No. 8. “A beautiful princess!” suggested No. 6. “_Something_,” said Aunt Judy, “but I am not going to tell you what at present. You must find out for yourselves. Meantime I shall call it _something_, or merely make a grunting—hm—when I allude to it, as people do to express a blank.” The little ones shuffled about in delighted impatience at the notion of the mysterious “something” which they were to find out, and Aunt Judy proceeded:— “This—hm—then, lived in a large meadow field, where it was the delight of all beholders. The owner of the property was constantly boasting about it to his friends, for he maintained that it was the richest, and most beautiful, and most valuable—hm—in all the country round. Surely no other thing in this world ever found itself more admired or prized than this _something_ did. The commonest passer-by would notice it, and say all manner of fine things in its praise, whether in the early spring, the full summer, or the autumn, for at each of these seasons it put on a fresh charm, and formed a subject of conversation. ‘Only look at that lovely—hm—’ was quite a common exclamation at the sight of it. ‘What a colour it has! How fresh and healthy it looks! How invaluable it must be! Why, it must be worth at least—’ and then the speaker would go calculating away at the number of pounds, shillings, and pence, the—hm—would fetch, if put into the money-market, which is, I am sorry to say, a very usual, although very degrading way of estimating worth. “To conclude, the mild-eyed Alderney cow, who pastured in the field during the autumn months, would chew the cud of approbation over the—hm—for hours together, and people said it was no wonder at all that she gave such delicious milk and cream.” Here a shout of supposed discovery broke from No. 5. “I’ve guessed, I know it!” But a “hush” from Aunt Judy stopped him short. “No. 5, nobody asked your opinion, keep it to yourself, if you please.” No. 5 was silenced, but rubbed his hands nevertheless. “Well,” continued Aunt Judy, “that ‘_something_’ ought surely to have been the most contented thing in the world. Its merits were acknowledged; its usefulness was undoubted; its beauty was the theme of constant admiration; what had it left to wish for? Really nothing; but by an unlucky accident it became dissatisfied with its situation in a meadow field, and wished to get into a higher position in life, which, it took for granted, would be more suited to its many exalted qualities. The ‘_something_’ of the field wanted to inhabit a garden. The unlucky accident that gave rise to this foolish idea, was as follows:— “A little boy was running across the beautiful meadow one morning, with a tin-pot full of fishing bait in his hand, when suddenly he stumbled and fell down. “The bait in the tin-pot was some lob-worms, which the little boy had collected out of the garden adjoining the field, and they were spilt and scattered about by his fall. “He picked up as many as he could find, however, and ran off again; but one escaped his notice and was left behind. “This gentleman was insensible for a few seconds; but as soon as he came to himself, and discovered that he was in a strange place, he began to grumble and find fault. “‘What an uncouth neighbourhood!’ Such were his exclamations. ‘What rough impracticable roads! Was ever lob-worm so unlucky before!’ It was impossible to move an inch without bumping his sides against some piece of uncultivated ground. “Judge for yourselves, my dears,” continued Aunt Judy, pathetically, “what must have been the feelings of the ‘_something_’ which had lived proudly and happily in the meadow field for so long, on hearing such offensive remarks. “Its spirit was up in a minute, just as yours would have been, and it did not hesitate to inform the intruder that travellers who find fault with a country before they have taken the trouble to inquire into its merits, are very ignorant and impertinent people. “This was blow for blow, as you perceive; and the _teaze-and-twit_ system was now continued with great animation on both sides. “The lob-worm inquired, with a conceited wriggle, what could be the merits of a country, where gentlemanly, gliding, thin-skinned creatures like himself were unable to move about without personal annoyance? Whereupon the amiable ‘_something_’ made no scruple of telling the lob-worm that his _betters_ found no fault with the place, and instanced its friend and admirer the Alderney cow. “On which the lob-worm affected forgetfulness, and exclaimed, ‘Cow? cow? do I know the creature? Ah! Yes, I recollect now; clumsy legs, horny feet, and that sort of thing,’ proceeding to hint that what was good enough for a cow, might yet not be refined enough for his own more delicate habits. “‘It is my misfortune, perhaps,’ concluded he, with mock humility, ‘to have been accustomed to higher associations; but really, situated as I am here, I could almost feel disposed to—why, positively, to wish myself a cow, with clumsy legs and horny feet. What one may live to come to, to be sure!’ “Well,” Aunt Judy proceeded, “will you believe it, the lob-worm went on boasting till the poor deluded ‘_something_’ believed every word he said, and at last ventured to ask in what favoured spot he had acquired his superior tastes and knowledge. “And then, of course, the lob-worm had the opportunity of opening out in a very magnificent bit of brag, and did not fail to do so. “Travellers can always boast with impunity to stationary folk, and the lob-worm had no conscience about speaking the truth. “So on he chattered, giving the most splendid account of the garden in which he lived. Gorgeous flowers, velvet lawns, polished gravel-walks, along which he was wont to take his early morning stroll, before the ruder creatures of the neighbourhood, such as dogs, cats, &c. were up and about, were all his discourse; and he spoke of them as if they were his own, and told of the nursing and tending of every plant in the lovely spot, as if the gardeners did it all for his convenience and pleasure. “Of the little accidents to which he and his race have from time immemorial been liable from awkward spades, or those very early birds, by whom he ran a risk of being snapped up every time he emerged out of the velvet lawns for the morning strolls, he said just nothing at all. “All was unmixed delight (according to his account) in the garden, and having actually boasted himself into good humour with himself, and therefore with everybody else, he concluded by expressing the condescending wish, that the ‘_something_’ in the field should get itself removed to the garden, to enjoy the life of which he spoke. “‘Undeniably beautiful as you are here,’ cried he, ‘your beauty will increase a thousand fold, under the gardener’s fostering care. Appreciated as you are now in your rustic life, the most prominent place will be assigned to you when you get into more distinguished society; so that everybody who passes by and sees you, will exclaim in delight, ‘Behold this exquisite—hm—!’” “Oh dear, Aunt Judy,” cried No. 6, “was the ‘hum,’ as you will call it, so silly as to believe what he said?” “How could the poor simple-minded thing be expected to resist such elegant compliments, my dear No. 6?” answered Aunt Judy. “But then came the difficulty. The ‘_something_’ which lived in the field had no more legs than the lob-worm himself, and, in fact, was incapable of locomotion.” “Of course it was!” ejaculated No. 5. “Order!” cried Aunt Judy, and proceeded:— “So the—hm—hung down its graceful head in despair, but suddenly a bright and loving thought struck it. It could not change its place and rise in life itself, but its children might, and that would be some consolation. It opened its heart on this point to the lob-worm, and although the lob-worm had no heart to be touched, he had still a tongue to talk. “If the—hm—would send its children to the garden at the first opportunity, he would be delighted, absolutely charmed, to introduce them in the world. He would put them in the way of everything, and see that they were properly attended to. There was nothing he couldn’t or wouldn’t do. “This last pretentious brag seemed to have exhausted even the lob-worm’s ingenuity, for, soon after he had uttered it, he shuffled away out of the meadow in the best fashion that he could, leaving the ‘_something_’ in the field in a state of wondering regret. But it recovered its spirits again when the time came for sending its children to the favoured garden abode. “‘My dears,’ it said, ‘you will soon have to begin life for yourselves, and I hope you will do so with credit to your bringing up. I hope you are now ambitious enough to despise the dull old plan of dropping contentedly down, just where you happen to be, or waiting for some chance traveller (who may never come) to give you a lift elsewhere. That paradise of happiness, of which the lob-worm told us, is close at hand. Come! it only wants a little extra exertion on your part, and you will be carried thither by the wind, as easily as the wandering Dandelion himself. Courage, my dears! nothing out of the common is ever gained without an effort. See now! as soon as ever a strong breeze blows the proper way, I shall shake my heads as hard as ever I can, that you may be off. All the doors and windows are open now, you know, and you must throw yourselves out upon the wind. Only remember one thing, when you are settled down in the beautiful garden, mind you hold up your heads, and do yourselves justice, my dears.’ “The children gave a ready assent, of course, as proud as possible at the notion; and when the favourable breeze came, and the maternal heads were shaken, out they all flew, and trusted themselves to its guidance, and in a few minutes settled down all over the beautiful garden, some on the beds, some on the lawn, some on the polished gravel-walks. And all I can say is, happiest those who were least seen!” “Grass weeds! grass weeds!” shouted the incorrigible No. 5, jumping up from his seat and performing two or three Dervish-like turns. “Oh, it’s too bad, isn’t it, Aunt Judy,” cried No. 6, “to stop your story in the middle?” Whereupon Aunt Judy answered that he had not stopped the story in the middle, but at the end, and she was glad he had found out the meaning of her—_hm_—! But No. 6 would not be satisfied, she liked to hear the complete finish up of everything. “Did the ‘_hum’s_’ children ever grow up in the garden, and did they ever see the lob-worm again?” “The—hm’s—children did _spring_ up in the garden,” answered Aunt Judy, “and did their best to exhibit their beauty on the polished gravel-walks, where they were particularly delighted with their own appearance one May morning after a shower of rain, which had made them more prominent than usual. ‘Remember our mother’s advice,’ cried they to each other. ‘This is the happy moment! Let us hold up our heads, and do ourselves justice, my dears.’ “Scarcely were the words spoken, when a troop of rude creatures came scampering into the walk, and a particularly unfeeling monster in curls, pointed to the beautiful up-standing little—hms—and shouted, ‘Aunt Judy, look at these _horrible weeds_!’ “I needn’t say any more,” concluded Aunt Judy. “You know how you’ve used them; you know what you’ve done to them; you know how you’ve even wished there were _no such things in the world_!” “Oh, Aunt Judy, how capital!” ejaculated No. 6, with a sigh, the sigh of exhausted amusement. “‘The _hum_ was a weed too, then, was it?” said No. 8. He did not quite see his way through the tale. “It was not a weed in the meadow,” answered Aunt Judy, “where it was useful, and fed the Alderney cow. It was beautiful Grass there, and was counted as such, because that was its proper place. But when it put its nose into garden-walks, where it was not wanted, and had no business, then everybody called the beautiful Grass a weed.” “So a weed is a vegetable out of its place, you see,” subjoined No. 5, who felt the idea to be half his own, “and it won’t do to wish there were none in the world.” “And a vegetable out of its place being nothing better than a weed, Mr. No. 5,” added Aunt Judy, “it won’t do to be too anxious about what is so often falsely called, bettering your condition in life. Come, the story is done, and now we’ll go home, and all the patient listeners and weeders may reckon upon getting one or more farthings apiece from mamma. And as No. 6’s wish is not realized, and there are still weeds {47} in the world, and among them Grass weeds, _I_ shall hope to have some cream to my tea.” COOK STORIES. “Down too, down at your own fireside, With the evil tongue and the evil ear, For each is at war with mankind.” TENNYSON’S _Maud_. AUNT JUDY had gone to the nursery wardrobe to look over some clothes, and the little ones were having a play to themselves. As she opened the door, they were just coming to the end of an explosive burst of laughter, in which all the five appeared to have joined, and which they had some difficulty in stopping. No. 4, who was a biggish girl, had giggled till the tears were running over her cheeks; and No. 8, in sympathy, was leaning back in his tiny chair in a sort of ecstasy of amusement. The five little ones had certainly hit upon some very entertaining game. They were all (boys and girls alike) dressed up as elderly ladies, with bits of rubbishy finery on their heads and round their shoulders, to imitate caps and scarfs; the boys’ hair being neatly parted and brushed down the middle; and they were seated in form round what was called “the Doll’s Table,” a concern just large enough to allow of a small crockery tea-service, with cups and saucers and little plates, being set out upon it. “What have you got there?” was all Aunt Judy asked, as she went up to the table to look at them. “Cowslip-tea,” was No. 4’s answer, laying her hand on the fat pink tea-pot; and thereupon the laughing explosion went off nearly as loudly as before, though for no accountable reason that Aunt Judy could divine. “It’s _so_ good, Aunt Judy, do taste it!” exclaimed No. 8, jumping up in a great fuss, and holding up his little cup, full of a pale-buff fluid, to Aunt Judy. “You’ll have everything over,” cried No. 4, calling him to order; and in truth the table was not the steadiest in the world. So No. 8 sat down again, calling out, in an almost stuttering hurry, “You may keep it all, Aunt Judy, I don’t want any more.” But neither did Aunt Judy, after she had given it one taste; so she put the cup down, thanking No. 8 very much, but pulling such a funny face, that it set the laugh going once more; in the middle of which No. 4 dropped an additional lump of sugar into the rejected buff-coloured mixture, a proceeding which evidently gave No. 8 a new relish for the beverage. Aunt Judy had got beyond the age when cowslip-tea was looked upon as one of the treats of life; and she had not, on the other hand, lived long enough to love the taste of it for the memory’s sake of the enjoyment it once afforded. Not but what we are obliged to admit that cowslip-tea is one of those things which, even in the most enthusiastic days of youth, just falls short of the absolute perfection one expects from it. Even under those most favourable circumstances of having had the delightful gathering of the flowers in the sweet sunny fields—the picking of them in the happy holiday afternoon—the permission to use the best doll’s tea-service for the feast—the loan of a nice white table-cloth—and the present of half-a-dozen pewter knives and forks to fancy-cut the biscuits with—nay, even in spite of the addition of well-filled doll’s sugar-pots and cream-jugs—cowslip-tea always seems to want either a leetle more or a leetle less sugar—or a leetle more or a leetle less cream—or to be a leetle more or a leetle less strong—to turn it into that complete nectar which, of course, it really _is_. On the present occasion, however, the children had clearly got hold of some other source of enjoyment over the annual cowslip-tea feast, besides the beverage itself; and Aunt Judy, glad to see them so safely happy, went off to her business at the wardrobe, while the little ones resumed their game. “Very extraordinary, indeed, ma’am!” began one of the fancy old ladies, in a completely fancy voice, a little affected, or so. “_Most_ extraordinary, ma’am, I may say!” (Here there was a renewed giggle from No. 4, which she carefully smothered in her handkerchief.) “But still I think I can tell you of something more extraordinary still!” The speaker having at this point refreshed his ideas by a sip of the pale-coloured tea, and the other ladies having laughed heartily in anticipation of the fun that was coming, one of them observed:— “You don’t _say_ so, ma’am—” then clicked astonishment with her tongue against the roof of her mouth several times, and added impressively, “_Pray_ let us hear!” “I shall be most happy, ma’am,” resumed the first speaker, with a graceful inclination forwards. “Well!—you see—it was a party. I had invited some of my most distinguished friends—really, ma’am, _fashionable_ friends, I may say, to dinner; and, ahem! you see—some little anxiety always attends such affairs—even—in the best regulated families!” Here the speaker winked considerably at No. 4, and laughed very loudly himself at his own joke. “Dear me, you must excuse me, ma’am,” he proceeded. “So, you see, I felt a little fatigued by my morning’s exertions, (to tell you the truth, there had been no end of bother about everything!) and I retired quietly up-stairs to take a short nap before the dressing-bell rang. But I had not been laid down quite half an hour, when there was a loud knock at the door. Really, ma’am, I felt quite alarmed, but was just able to ask, ‘Who’s there?’ Before I had time to get an answer, however, the door was burst open by the housemaid. Her face was absolute scarlet, and she sobbed out:— “‘Oh, ma’am, what shall we do?’ “‘Good gracious, Hannah,’ cried I, ‘what can be the matter? Has the soot come down the chimney? Speak!’ “‘It’s nothing of that sort, ma’am,’ answered Hannah, ‘it’s the cook!’ “‘The cook!’ I shouted. ‘I wish you would not be so foolish, Hannah, but speak out at once. What about Cook?’ “‘Please, m’m, the cook’s lost!’ says Hannah. ‘We can’t find her!’ “‘Your wits are lost, Hannah, _I_ think,’ cried I, and sent her to tidy the rooms while I slipt downstairs to look for the cook. “Fancy a lost cook, ma’am! Was there ever such a ridiculous idea? And on the day of a dinner-party too! Did you ever hear of such a trial to a lady’s feelings before?” “Never, I am sure,” responded the lady opposite. “Did _you_, ma’am?” turning to her neighbour. But the other three ladies all shook their heads, bit their lips, and declared that they “Never had, they were sure!” “I thought not!” ejaculated the narrator. “Well, ma’am, I went into the kitchens, the larder, the pantries, the cellars, and all sorts of places, and still no cook! Do you know, she really was nowhere! Actually, ma’am, the cook was lost!” Shouts of laughter burst forth here; but the lady (who was No. 5) put up his hand, and called out in his own natural tones:— “Stop! I haven’t got to the end yet!” “Order!” proclaimed No. 4 immediately, in a very commanding voice, and thumping the table with the head of an old wooden doll to enforce obedience. And then the sham lady proceeded in the same mincing voice as before:— “Well!—dear me, I’m quite put out. But however, you see—what was to be done, that was the thing. It wanted only half an hour to dinner-time, and there was the meat roasting away by itself, and the potatoe-pan boiling over. You never heard such a fizzling as it made in your life—in short, everything was in a mess, and there was no cook. “Well! I basted the meat for a few minutes, took the potatoe-pan off the fire, and then ran up-stairs to put on my bonnet. Thought I, the best thing I can do is to send somebody for the policeman, and let _him_ find the cook. But while I was tying the strings of my bonnet, I fancied I heard a mysterious noise coming out of the bottom drawer of my wardrobe. Fancy that, ma’am, with my nerves in such a state from the cook being lost!” No. 5 paused, and looked round for sympathy, which was most freely given by the other ladies, in the shape of sighs and exclamations. “The drawer was a very deep drawer, ma’am, so I thought perhaps the cat had crept in,” continued No. 5. “Well, I went to it to see, and there it was, partly open, with a cotton gown in it that didn’t belong to me. Imagine my feelings at _that_, ma’am! So I pulled at the handles to get the drawer quite open, but it wouldn’t come, it was as heavy as lead. It was really very alarming—one doesn’t like such odd things happening—but at last I got it open, though I tumbled backwards as I did so; and what do you think, ma’am—ladies—what _do_ you think was in it?” “The cook!” shrieked No. 4, convulsed with laughter; and the whole party clapped their hands and roared applause. “The cook, ma’am, actually the cook!” pursued No. 5, “one of the fattest, most _poonchy_ little women you ever saw. And what do you think was the history of it? I kept my up-stairs Pickwick in the corner of that bottom drawer. She had seen it there that very morning, when she was helping to dust the room, and took the opportunity of a spare half-hour to slip up and rest herself by reading it in the drawer. Unluckily, however, she had fallen asleep, and when I got the drawer out, there she lay, and I actually heard her snore. A shocking thing this education, ma’am, you see, and teaching people to read. All the cooks in the country are spoilt!” Peals of laughter greeted this wonderfully witty concoction of No. 5’s, and the lemon-coloured tea and biscuits were partaken of during the pause which followed. Aunt Judy meanwhile, who had been quite unable to resist joining in the laugh herself, was seated on the floor, behind the open door of the wardrobe, thinking to herself of certain passages in Wordsworth’s most beautiful ode, in which he has described the play of children, “As if their whole vocation Were endless imitation.” Truly they had got hold here of strange “Fragments from their dream of human life.” Where _could_ the children have picked up the original of such absurd nonsense? Aunt Judy had no time to make it out, for now the mincing voices began again, and she sat listening. “Have _you_ had no curious adventures with your maids, ma’am?” inquires No. 5 of No. 4. No. 5 makes an attempt at a bewitching grin as he speaks, fanning himself with a fan which he has had in his hand all the time he was telling his story. “Well, ladies,” replied No. 4, only just able to compose herself to talk, “I don’t think I _have_ been quite as fortunate as yourselves in having so many extraordinary things to tell. My servants have been sadly common-place, and done just as they ought. But still, _once_, ladies—once, a curious little incident did occur to me.” “Oh, ma’am, I entreat you—pray let us hear it!” burst from all the ladies at once. No. 4 had to bite her lip to preserve her gravity, and then she turned to No. 5— “The fan, if you please, ma’am!” The rule was, that the one fan was placed at the disposal of the story-teller for the time, so No. 5 handed it to No. 4, with a graceful bow; and No. 4 waffed it to and fro immediately, and began her account:— “People are so unscrupulous you see, ladies, about giving characters. It’s really shocking. For my part, I don’t know what the world will come to at last. We shall all have to be our own servants, I suppose. People say anything about anything, that’s the fact! Only fancy, ma’am, three different ladies once recommended a cook to me as the best soup-maker in the country. Now that sounded a very high recommendation, for, of course, if a cook can make soups, she can do anything—sweetmeats and those kind of things follow of themselves. So, ma am, I took her, and had a dinner-party, and ordered two soups, entirely that I might show off what a good cook I had got. Think what a compliment to her, and how much obliged she ought to have been! Well, ma’am, I ordered the two soups, as I said, one white, and the other brown; and everything appeared to be going on in the best possible manner, when, as I was sitting in the drawing-room entertaining the company, I was told I was wanted. [Picture: Playing at ladies] “When I got out of the room, there was the man I had hired to wait, and says he:— “‘If you please, ma’am where are the knives? I can’t find any at all!’ “‘No knives!’ says I. ‘Dear me, don’t come to me about the knives. Ask the cook, of course.’ “‘Please, ma’am, I have asked her, and she only laughed.’ “‘Then,’ said I, ‘ask the housemaid. It’s impossible for me to come out and look for the knives.’ “Well, ladies,” continued No. 4, “would you believe it?—could anyone believe it?—when I sat down to dinner, and began to help the soup, no sooner had the silver ladle (_my_ ladle is silver, ladies) been plunged into the tureen, than a most singular rattling was heard. “‘William,’ cried I, half in a whisper, to the waiter who was holding the plate, ‘what in the world is this? Surely Cook has not left the bones in?’ “‘Please, ma’am, I don’t know,’ was all the man could say. “Well—there was no remedy now, so I dipped the ladle in again, and lifted out—oh! ma’am, I know if it was anybody but myself who told you, you wouldn’t believe it—a ladleful of the lost knives! There they were, my best beautiful ivory handles, all in the white soup! And while I was discovering them, the gentleman at the other end of the table had found all the kitchen-knives, with black handles, in the brown soup! “There never was anything so mortifying before. And what do you think was Cook’s excuse, when I reproached her? “‘Please, ma’am,’ said she, ‘I read in the _Young Woman’s Vademecum of Instructive Information_, page 150, that there was nothing in the world so strengthening and wholesome as dissolved bones, and ivory-dust; and so, ma’am, I always make a point of throwing in a few knives into every soup I have the charge of, for the sake of the handles—ivory-handles for white soups, ma’am, and black-handles for the browns!’” Thunders of applause interrupted Cook’s excuse at this point, and No. 7 was so overcome that he pushed his chair back, and performed three distinct somersets on the floor, to the complete disorganization of his head-dress, which consisted of a turban, from beneath which hung a cluster of false curls. Turban and wig being replaced, however, and No. 7 reseated and composed, No. 4 proceeded:— “Cook generally takes them out, she informed me, ladies, before the tureens come to table; ‘but,’ said she, ‘my back was turned for a minute here, ma’am, and that stupid William carried them off without asking if they were ready. It’s all William’s fault, ma’am; and I don’t mean to stay, for I don’t like a place where the man who waits has no tact!’ “Now, ladies,” continued No. 4, “what do you think of that by way of a speech from a cook? And I assure you that a medical man’s wife, to whom I mentioned in the course of the evening what Cook had said about dissolved bones, told me that her husband had only laughed, and said Cook was quite right. So she hired the woman that night herself, and I have been told in confidence since—you’ll not repeat it, therefore, of course, ladies?” “Of course not!” came from all sides. “Well, then, I was told that, before the year was out, the family hadn’t a knife that would cut anything, they were so cankered with rust. So much for education and learning to read, as you justly observed, ma’am, before!” When the emotions produced by this tale had a little subsided, No. 7 was called upon for his experience of maids. No. 7, with the turban on his head, and a fine red necklace round his throat, said he took very little notice of the maids, but that he once had had a very tiresome little boy in buttons, who was extremely fond of sugar, and always carried the sugar-shaker in his pocket, and ate up the sugar that was in it, and when it was empty, filled it up with magnesia. “But _once_,” he added, “ladies, he actually put some soda in. It was at a party, and we had our first rhubarb tart for the season, and the company sprinkled it all over with the soda and began to eat, but they were too polite to say how nasty it was. But, of course, when I was helped I called out. And what do you think the boy in buttons said?” Nobody could guess, so No. 7 had to tell them. “He said he had put it in on purpose, because he thought it would correct the acid of the pie. So I said he had best be apprenticed to a doctor; so he went—I dare say, ma’am, it was the same doctor who took your cook—but I never heard of him any more, and I’ve never dared to have a boy in buttons again.” “A very wise decision, ma’am, I’m sure!” cried Aunt Judy, who came up to the wonderful tea-table in the midst of the last mound of applause. “And now may I ask what game this is that you are playing at?” “Oh, we’re telling _Cook Stories_, Aunt Judy,” cried No. 6, seizing her by the arm; “they’re such capital fun! I wish you had heard mine; they were laughing at it when you first came in!” “It must have been delicious, to judge by the delight it gave,” replied Aunt Judy, smiling, and kissing No. 6’s oddly bedizened up-turned face. “But what I want to know is, what put Cook Stories, as you call them, into your head?” “Oh! don’t you remember—” and here followed a long account from No. 6 of how, about a week before, the little ones had gone somewhere to spend the day, and how it had turned out a very rainy day, so that they could not have games out of doors with their young friends, as had been expected, but were obliged to sit a great part of the time in the drawing-room, putting Chinese puzzles together into stupid patterns, and playing at fox-and-goose, while the ladies were talking “grown-up conversation,” as No. 6 worded it, among themselves; and, of course, being on their own good behaviour, and very quiet, they could not help hearing what was said. “And, oh dear, Aunt Judy,” continued No. 6, now with both her arms holding Aunt Judy, of whom she was very fond, (except at lesson times!) round the waist, “it was so odd! No. 7 and I did nothing at last but listen and watch them; for little Miss, who sat with us, was shy, and wouldn’t talk, and it was so very funny to see the ladies nodding and making faces at each other, and whispering, and exclaiming, how shocking! how abominable! you don’t say so! and all that kind of thing!” “Well, but what was shocking, and abominable, and all that kind of thing?” inquired Aunt Judy. “Oh, I don’t know—things the nurses, and cooks, and boys in buttons did. Almost all the ladies had some story to tell—all the servants had done something or other queer—but especially the cooks, Aunt Judy, there was no end to the cooks. So one day after we came back, and we didn’t know what to play at, I said: ‘Do let us play at telling Cook Stories, like the ladies at —.’ So we’ve dressed up, and played at Cook Stories, ever since. Dear Aunt Judy, I wish you would invent a Cook Story yourself!” was the conclusion of No. 6’s account. So then the mystery was out. Aunt Judy’s wonderings were cut short. Out of the real life of civilized intelligent society had come those “Fragments from their dream of human life,” which Aunt Judy had called absurd nonsense. And absurd nonsense, indeed, it was; but Aunt Judy was seized by the idea that some good might be got out of it. So, in answer to No. 6’s wish, she said, with a shy smile:— “I don’t think I could tell Cook Stories half as well as yourself. But if, by way of a change, you would like a _Lady_ Story instead, perhaps I might be able to accomplish that.” “A _Lady_ Story! Oh, but that would be so dull, wouldn’t it?” inquired No. 6. “You can’t make anything funny out of them, surely! Surely they never do half such odd things as cooks, and boys in buttons!” “The ladies themselves think not, of course,” was Aunt Judy’s reply. “Well, but what do you think, Aunt Judy?” “Oh, I don’t think it matters what I think. The question is, what do cooks and boys in buttons think?” “But, Aunt Judy, ladies are never tiresome, and idle, and impertinent, like cooks and boys in buttons. Oh! if you had but heard the _real_ Cook Stories those ladies told! I say, let me tell you one or two—I do think I can remember them, if I try.” “Then don’t try on any account, dear No. 6,” exclaimed Aunt Judy. “I like make-believe Cook Stories much better than real ones.” “So do I!” cried No. 7, “they’re so much the more entertaining.” “And not a bit less useful,” subjoined Aunt Judy, with a sly smile. “Well, I didn’t see much good in the real ones,” pursued No. 7, in a sort of muse. “Let us tell you another make-believe one, then,” cried No. 6, who saw that Aunt Judy was moving off, and wanted to detain her. “Then it’s _my_ turn!” shouted No. 8, jumping up, and stretching out his arm and hand like a young orator flushed to his work. And actually, before the rest of the little ones could put him down or stop him, No. 8 contrived to tumble out the Cook Story idea, which had probably been brewing in his head all the time of Aunt Judy’s talk. It was very brief, and this was it, delivered in much haste, and with all the earnestness of a maiden speech. “_I_ had a button boy too, and he was a—what d’ye call it—oh, a _rascal_, that was it;—he was a rascal, and liked the currants in mince-pies, so he took them all out, and ate them up, and put in glass beads instead. So when the people began to ear, their teeth crunched against the beads! Ah! bah! how nasty it was!” No. 8 accompanied this remark with a corresponding grimace of disgust, and then observed in conclusion:— “Perhaps he found it in a book, but I don’t know where,” after which he lowered his outstretched arm, smiled, and sat down. The company clapped applause, and No. 4 especially must have been very fond of laughing, for the glass-bead anecdote set her off again as heartily as ever, and the rest followed in her wake, and while so doing, never noticed that Aunt Judy had slipped away. They soon discovered it, however, when their mirth began to subside; but before they had time to wonder much, there appeared from behind the door of the wardrobe a figure, which in their secret souls they knew to be Aunt Judy herself, although it looked a great deal stouter, and had a thick-filled cap on its head, a white linen apron over its gown, and a pair of spectacles on its nose. At sight of it they showed signs of clapping again, but stopped short when it spoke to them as a stranger, and willingly received it as such. Ah! it is one of the sweet features of childhood that it yields itself up so readily to any little surprise or delusion that is prepared for its amusement. No nasty pride, no disinclination to be carried away, no affected indifference, interfere with young children’s enjoyment of what is offered them. They will even help themselves into the pleasant visions by an effort of will; and perhaps, now and then, end by partly believing what they at first received voluntarily as an agreeable make-believe. If, therefore, after the cook figure of Aunt Judy had seated itself by the doll’s table, and the little ones had looked and grinned at it for some time, hazy sensations began to steal over one or two minds, that this _was_ somehow really a cook, it was all in the natural course of things, and nobody resisted the feeling. Aunt Judy’s altered voice, and odd, assumed manner, contributed, no doubt, a good deal to the impression. “Dear, dear! what pretty little darlings you all are!” she began, looking at them one after another. “As sweet as sugar-plums, when you have your own way, and are pleased. Eh, dears? But you don’t think you can take old Cooky in, do you? No, no, I know what ladies and gentlemen, and ladies’ and gentlemen’s _young_ ladies and _young_ gentlemen are, pretty well, dears, I can tell you! Don’t I know all about the shiny hair and smiling faces of the little pets in the parlour, and how they leave parlour-manners behind them sometimes, when they run to the kitchen to Cook, and order her here and there, and want half-a-dozen things at once, and must and will have what they want, and are for popping their fingers into every pie! “Well, well,” she proceeded, “the parlour’s the parlour, and the kitchen’s the kitchen, and I’m only a cook. But then I conduct myself _as_ Cook, even when I’m in the scullery, and I only wish ladies, and ladies’ _young_ ladies too, would conduct themselves as ladies, even when they come into the kitchen; that’s what I call being honourable and upright. Well, dears, I’ll tell you how I came to know all about it. You see, I lived once in a family where there were no less than eight of those precious little pets, and a precious time I had of it with them. But, to be sure, now it’s past and gone—I can make plenty of excuses for them, poor things! They were so coaxed and flattered, and made so much of, what could be expected from them but tiresome, wilful ways, without any sense? “‘If your mamma would but put _you_ into the scullery, young miss, to learn to wash plates and scour the pans out, she’d make a woman of you,’ used I to think to myself when a silly child, who thought itself very clever to hinder other people’s work, would come hanging about in the kitchen, doing nothing but teaze and find fault, for that’s what a girl can always do. “It was very aggravating, you may be sure, dears, (you see I can talk to you quite reasonably, because you’re so nicely behaved;)—it was very aggravating, of course; but I used to make allowances for them. Says I to myself, ‘Cook, you’ve had the blessing of being brought up to hard work ever since you were a babby. You’ve had to earn your daily bread. Nobody knows how that brings people to their senses till they’ve tried; so don’t you go and be cocky, because ladies and gentlemen, and ladies’ and gentlemen’s _young_ ladies and _young_ gentlemen, are not quite so sensible as you are. Who knows but what, if you’d been born to do nothing, you might have been no wiser than them! It’s lucky for you you’re only a cook; but don’t you go and be cocky, that’s all! Make allowances; it’s the secret of life!’ “So you see, dears, I _did_ make allowances; and after the eight little pets was safe in bed till next morning, I used to feel quite composed, and pitiful-like towards them, poor little dears! But certainly, when morning came, and the oldest young master was home for the holidays, it was a trying time for me, and I couldn’t think of the allowances any longer. Either he wouldn’t get up and come down till everyone else had had their breakfast, and so he wanted fresh water boiled, and fresh tea made, and another muffin toasted, and more bacon fried; or else he was up so outrageous early, that he was scolding because there was no hot water before the fire was lit—bless you, he hadn’t a bit of sense in his head, poor boy, not a bit! And how should he? Why, he went to school as soon as he was out of petticoats, and was set to all that Latin and Greek stuff that never puts anything useful into folks’ heads, but so much more chatter and talk; so he came back as silly as he went, poor thing! Dear me, on a wet day, after lesson-time, those boys were like so many crazy creatures. ‘Cook, I must make a pie,’ says one. ‘There’s a pie in the oven already, Master James,’ says I. ‘I don’t care about the pie in the oven,’ says he, ‘I want a pie of my own. Bring me the flour, and the water, and the butter, and all the things—and, above all, the rolling-pin—and clear the decks, will you, I say, for my pie. Here goes!’ And here used to go, my dears, for Master James had no sense, as I told you; and so he’d shove all my pots and dishes away, one on the top of the other; and let me be as busy as I would, and dinner ever so near ready, the dresser must be cleared, and everything must give way to _his_ pie! His pie, indeed—I wish I had had the management of his pie just then! I’d have taught him what it was to come shaking the rolling-pin at the head of a respectable cook, who wanted to get her business done properly, as in duty bound! “But he wasn’t the only one. There was little Whipper-snapper, his younger brother, squeaking out in another corner, ‘I shan’t make a pie, James, I shall make toffey; it’s far better fun. You’d better come and help me. Where’s the treacle pot, Cook? Cook! I say, Cook! where’s the treacle-pot? And look at this stupid kettle and pan. What’s in the pan, I wonder? Oh, kidney-beans! Who cares for kidney-beans? How can I make toffey, when all these things are on the fire? Stay, I’ll hand them all off!’ “And, sure enough, if I hadn’t rushed from Master James, who was drinking away at my custard out of the bowl, to seize on Whipper-snapper, who had got his hand on the vegetable-pan already, he would have pulled it and the kettle, and the whole concern, off the fire, and perhaps scalded himself to death. “Then, of course, there comes a scuffle, and Master Whipper-snapper begins to roar, and out comes Missus, who, poor thing, had no more sense in her head than her sons, though she’d never been to school to lose it over Latin and Greek; and, says she, with all her ribbons streaming, and her petticoats swelled out like a window-curtain in a draught—says she:— “‘Cook! I desire that you will not touch my children!’ “‘As you please, ma’am,’ says I, ‘if you’ll be so good as to stop the young gentlemen from touching my pans, and—’ I was going to say ‘custard,’ but Master James shouts out quite quick:— “‘Why, I only wanted to make a pie, mamma.’ “‘And I only wanted to make some toffey!’ cries Whipper-snapper; and then mamma answers, like a duchess at court:— “‘There can’t possibly be any objection, my dears; and I wish, Cook, you would he a little more good-natured to the children;—your temper is sadly against you!’ “And out she sails, ribbons and window-curtains and all; and, says I to myself, as I cooled down, (for the young gentlemen luckily went away with their dear mama,)—says I to myself, ‘It’s a very fine thing, no doubt, to go about in ribbons, and petticoats, and grand clothes; but, if one must needs carry such a poor, silly head inside them, as Missus does, I’d rather stop as I am, and be a cook with some sense about me.’ “I don’t say, my dears,” continued the supposed cook, “that I spoke very politely just then; but who could feel polite, when their dinner had been put back at least half-an-hour over such nonsense as that? Missus used to say the ‘dear boys’ came to the kitchen on a wet day, because they’d got _nothing else to do_! Nothing else to do! and had learnt Latin and Greek, and all sorts of schooling besides! So much for education, thought I. Why, it would spoil the best lads that ever were born into the world. For, of course, you know if these young gentlemen had been put to decent trades, they’d have found something else to do with their fingers besides mischief and waste. And, dear me, I talk about not having been polite to Missus just then, but now you tell me, dears, what Missus, with all her education, would have said if she’d been in my place, when one young gentleman was drinking her custard, and another young gentleman was pulling her pans on the floor! Do you think she’d have been a bit more polite than I was? Wouldn’t she have called me all the stupid creatures that ever were born, and told the story over and over to all her friends and acquaintance to make them stare, and say there were surely no such simpletons in the world as ladies and gentlemen, and ladies’ and gentlemen’s young ladies and young gentlemen? “However, I did not go as far as that, because, you see, I had some sense about me, and could make allowances for all the nonsense the poor things are brought up to.” There was no resisting the twinkle in Aunt Judy’s eye when she came to this point, though it shone through an old pair of Nurse’s spectacles; and the little ones clapped their hands, and declared it was every bit as good as a Cook story, _only a great deal better_! That twinkle had quite brought Aunt Judy back to them again, in spite of her cook’s attire, and No. 6 cried out:— “Oh! don’t stop, Aunt Judy! Do go on, Cooky dear! do tell some more! Did you always live in that place, please?” “There now!” exclaimed Aunt Judy, throwing herself back in the chair, “isn’t that a regular young lady’s question, out and out? Who but a young lady, with no more sense in her head than a pin, would have thought of asking such a thing? Why, miss, is there a joint in the world that can bear basting for ever? No, no! a time comes when it must be taken down, if any good’s to be left in it; and so at the end of three years my basting-time was over, and the time for taking down was come. “‘Cook,’ says I to myself, ‘you must give in. If you go on with those cherubs (that was their company name, you know) much longer, there won’t be a bit of you left!’ And, sure enough, that very morning, dears, they’d come down upon me with a fresh grievance, and I couldn’t stand it, I really couldn’t! The sweeps had been by four o’clock to the kitchen chimney, and I’d been up and toiling every minute since, and hadn’t had time to eat my breakfast, when in they burst—the young ladies, not the sweeps, dears, I mean:—and there they broke out at once—I hadn’t fed their sea-gulls before breakfast—(a couple of dull-looking grey birds, with big mouths, that had come in a hamper over night as a present to the cherubs;) and it seems I ought to have been up before daylight almost, to look for slugs for them in the garden till they’d got used to the place! “Oh, these ladies and gentlemen! they’d need know something of some sort to make amends, for there are many things they never know all their life long! “‘Young ladies,’ says I, ‘I didn’t come here to get meals ready for sea-gulls, but Christian ladies and gentlemen. If the sea-gulls want a cook, your mamma must hire them one on purpose. I’ve plenty to do for her and the family, without looking after such nonsense as that!’ “‘That’s what you always say,’ whimpers the youngest Miss; ‘and you know they don’t want any cooking, but only raw slugs! And you know you might easily look for them, because you’ve got almost nothing to do, because it’s such an easy place, mamma always says. But you’re always cross, mamma says that too, and everybody knows you are, because she tells everybody!’ “When little Miss had got that out, she thought she’d finished me up; and so she had, for when I heard that Missus was so ungenteel as to go talking of what I did, to all her acquaintance, and had nothing better to talk about, I made up my mind that I’d give notice that very day. “‘Very well, miss,’ says I, ‘your mamma shall soon have something fresh to talk about, and I hope she’ll find it a pleasant change.’ “There was some of them knew what I meant at once, for after they’d scampered off I heard shouts up and down the stairs from one to the other, ‘Cook’s going!’ ‘We shall have a new cook soon!’ ‘What a lark we’ll have with the toffey and the pies! We’ll make her do just as we choose!’ “‘There, now,’ thought I to myself, ‘there’ll be somebody else put down to baste before long. Well, I’m glad my time’s over.’ And thereupon I fell to wishing I was back again in father and mother’s ricketty old cottage, that I’d once been so proud to leave, to go and live with gentlefolks. But, you see, it was no use wishing, for I’d my bread to earn, and must turn out somewhere, let it be as disagreeable as it would. Father and mother were dead, and there was no ricketty cottage for me to go back to, so I wiped my eyes, and told myself to make the best of what had to be. “Well, dears,” pursued Cooky, after a short pause, during which the little ones looked far more inclined to cry than laugh, “Missus was quite taken aback when she heard I wouldn’t stay any longer. “‘Cook,’ she said, ‘I’m perfectly astonished at your want of sense in not recognizing the value of such a situation as mine! and as to your complaints about the children, anything more ridiculously unreasonable I never heard! Such superior, well-taught young people, you are not very likely to meet with again in a hurry!’ “‘Perhaps not, ma’am,’ says I, ‘in French, and crochet, and the piano, and Latin, and things I don’t understand, being only a cook. But I know what behaviour is, and that’s what I’m sure the young ladies and gentlemen have never been taught; or if they have, they’re so slow at taking it in, that I think I shall do better with a family where the behaviour-lessons come first!’ “Missus was very angry, and so was I; but at last she said:— “‘Cook, I shall not argue with you any longer; you know no better, and I suppose I must make allowances for you.’ “‘I’m much obliged to you, ma’am, I’m sure,’ was my answer; ‘it’s what I’ve always done by you ever since I came to the house, and I’ll do it still with pleasure, and think no more of what’s been said.’ “I spoke from my heart, I can tell you, dears, for I felt very sorry for Missus, and thought she was but a lady after all, and perhaps I’d hardly made allowances enough. I’d lost my temper, too, as I knew after she went away. But, you see, while she was there, it was so mortifying to be spoken to as if all the sense was on her side, when I knew it was all on mine, wherever the French and crochet may have been. Well, but the day before I left, I broke down with another of them, as it’s fair that you should know. “I’d felt very lonely that day, busy as I was, and in the afternoon I took myself into the scullery to give the pans a sort of good-bye cleaning, and be out of everybody’s way. But there, in the midst of it, comes the eldest young gentleman flinging into the kitchen, shouting, ‘Cook! Cook! Where’s Cook?’ as usual. I thought he was after some of his old tricks, and I _had_ been fretting over those pans, thinking what a sad job it was to have no home to go to in the world, so I gave him a very short answer. “‘Master James,’ says I, ‘I’ve done with nonsense now, I can’t attend to you. You must wait till the next cook comes.’ “But Master James came straight away to the scullery door, and says he, ‘Cook, I’m not coming to teaze. I’ve brought you a needle-book. There, Cook! It’s full of needles. I put them all in myself. Keep it, please.’ “Dear, dear, I can’t forget it yet,” pursued Cook, “how Master James stood on the little stone step of the scullery, with his arm stretched out, and the needle-book that he’d bought for me in his hand. I don’t know how I thanked him, I’m sure; but I had to go back to the sink and wash the dirt off my hands before I could touch the pretty little thing, and then I told him I would keep it as long as ever I lived. “He laughed, and says he, ‘Now shake hands, Cooky,’ and so we shook hands; and then off he ran, and I went back to my pans and fairly cried. ‘Why, Cook,’ says I to myself, ‘that lad’s got as good a heart as your own, after all. And as to sense and behaviour, they haven’t been forced upon him yet, as they have upon you. Latin’s Latin, and conduct’s conduct, and one doesn’t teach the other; and it’s too bad to expect more of people than what they’ve had opportunity for.’ “Well, dears, that was the rule I always went by, and I’ve been in many situations since—with single ladies, and single gentlemen, and large families, and all; and there was something to put up with in all of them; and they always told me there was a good deal to put up with in me, and perhaps there was. However, it doesn’t matter, so long as Missus and servant go by one rule—_to make allowances_, _and not expect more from people than what they’ve had opportunity for_; and, above all, never to be cocky when all the advantage is on their own side. It’s a good rule, dears, and will stop many a foolish word and idle tale, if you’ll go by it.” Aunt Judy had finished at last, and she took off the old spectacles and laid them on the doll’s table, and paused. “It _is_ a good rule,” observed No. 4, “and I shall go by it, and not tell real Cook Stories when I grow up, I hope.” “I love old Cooky,” cried No. 6, getting up and hugging her round the neck; “but is it wrong, Aunt Judy, to tell funny make-believe Cook Stories, like ours?” “Not at all, No. 6,” replied Aunt Judy. “My private belief is, that if you tell funny make-believe Cook Stories while you’re little, you will be ashamed of telling stupid real ones when you’re grown up.” RABBITS’ TAILS. “Death and its two-fold aspect! wintry—one, Cold, sullen, blank, from hope and joy shut out; The other, which the ray divine hath touch’d, Replete with vivid promise, bright as spring.” WORDSWORTH. “WELL then; but you must remember that I have my people to fight against the French, who have placed a French king in your country." "Yes," said the Spaniard, frowning, as he sent a curl of fragrant smoke eddying towards the shutter-opening in the sloping roof, where as it rose soft and grey it began to glow with gold as it reached the sunshine that streamed across the little square; "they have thrust upon us another of the usurper's kin, and this Napoleon has imprisoned our lawful ruler in Valencay." "I didn't know all this," replied Pen; "but I like to hear." "Good!" said the smuggler, nodding and speaking eagerly. "And you are an Englishman and fighting on our side. I know all this, and that your Wellesley is a brave general who is only waiting his time to sweep our enemies back to their own country. You are a friend who has suffered in our cause, and I can confide in you. You will be glad to hear that the prisoner has escaped." "Yes," said Pen, forgetting the pain of his wound for the time in the interest of what he heard, while Punch yawned and did not seem happy with his cigarette. "But what prisoner?" "The King, Ferdinand." Pen had never heard of any Ferdinand except one that he had read of in Shakespeare; but he said softly, "I am glad." "Yes," said the smuggler, "and I and my friends are glad--glad that, poor smugglers though we are, and no soldiers, we can be of service to his Majesty. He has escaped from the French prison and is on his way to the Pyrenees, where we can help him onward to Madrid. For we as _contrabandistas_ know all the passes through the frontier; and I and my followers are waiting till he reaches the appointed spot, where some of our brothers will bring him on to meet us, who will be ready to guide him and his friends farther on their way to the capital, or place them in safety in one of our hiding-places, our stores, of which we have many here in the mountains. He is long in coming, but he is on his way, and the last news I heard is that he is hidden by my friends at one of our _caches_ a score or so of leagues away. He may be here to-night if the pass seems clear. It may be many nights; but he will come, and if the French arrive--well, they will have to fight," said the smuggler, with a smile; and he lightly tapped the butt of one of his pistols. "It is hard for a king to have to steal away and hide; but every league he passes through the mountains here he will find more friends; and we shall try, some of us, to guide your English generals to where they can strike at our French foes. Yes, my young friend," continued the captain, rolling up a fresh cigarette, "and we shall serve our King well in all this, and if some of us fall--well, it will be in a good cause, and better than spending our lives in carrying smuggled goods--silks and laces, _eau de vie_, cigars and tobacco duty free across these hills. There, we are _contrabandistas_, and we are used to risking our lives, for on either side of the mountains the Governments shoot us down. But we are patriots all the same, and we are risking our lives for our King just as if we were of the best. So get well, you two brave soldier lads. I see you have your guns, and maybe, as we have helped you, we may ask you to help us. You need not mind, for you will be fighting against your enemies the French. Come, light up your cigarette again. You must be tired of my long story." "Tired! No," said Pen. "I am glad to hear it, for I have often thought and wondered why we English had come here to fight, and all I knew was that Napoleon was conquering everywhere and trying to master the world." "Which he will never do," said the smuggler, laughing. "Strong as he is, and masterful, he will never succeed, and you know why?" "No, I can't say that," replied Pen, wincing. "Then I will tell you. Because the more he conquers the more enemies he makes, and nowhere friends. There, you are growing weary." "Oh no," cried Pen. "I shrank because I felt my wound a little more. I am glad to hear all this." "But your friend--no?" said the _contrabandista_. "That's because he cannot understand what you say; but I shall tell him all that you have said when we are alone, and then he will be as much your friend as I am, and quite as ready to fight in your cause, though he is a boy." "Good!" said the Spaniard. "And some day I shall put you both to the proof." CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT. PUNCH PROVES STURDY. "Thank you," said Punch. "I didn't want to bother you, you know, comrade, only you see I ain't like you--I don't know a dozen languages, French and Latin, and all the rest of them; and when you get on talking to that _contrabando_ chap it worries me. Seems as if you are saying all sorts of things about me. He will keep looking at me all the time he's talking. I've got to know a bit now that it's meant for you, but he will keep fixing his eyes like a pair of gimlets, and screwing them into me; and then he goes on talking, and it makes you feel uncomfortable like. Now, you see, there was the other day, a week--no, it was nine days--ago, when you said when he was telling you all about the Spanish King coming here--" "Nine days ago, Punch! Nonsense! We can't have been here nine days." "Oh yes, we can. It's ten, because there was the day before, when he came first and doctored your leg." "Well, you seem very sure about it; but I think you are wrong." "I ain't," said Punch sturdily. "Lookye here," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought it out again full of little pebbles. "Well, what have they got to do with it?" "Everything. I puts a fresh one into my pocket every day we stops." "What for?" "To count up with. Each of those means two shillings that we owe the old gentleman for our prog. Knowing what a gentleman you are in your ideas, I says to myself you will want to pay him some day--a shilling apiece a day; that's what I put it at, and that means we owe him a pound; and if we are going to stop here much longer I must try another dodge, especially if we are going on the march, for I don't want to go tramping along with half a hundredweight of stones in my pocket." "You're a rum fellow, Punch," said Pen, smiling. "That's what my mother used to say; and I am glad of it. It does a fellow good to see you burst out laughing. Why, I haven't seen you grin like that not since the day when I went down with the bullet in my back. Here, I know what I'll do. I'll chuck all these stones, and make a scratch for every day on the stock of my musket. 'Tain't as if it was a Bri'sh rifle and the sergeant coming round and giving you hooroar for not keeping your arms in order. That would be a good way, wouldn't it, because the musket-stock wouldn't weigh any heavier when you had done than when you had begun." "Well, are you satisfied now, Punch, that he isn't talking about you?" "Well, you say he ain't, and that's enough; but I want to know, all the same, why that there Spanish King don't come." "So does he. You saw how earnest he was yesterday when he came and talked to me, after seeing to my leg, and telling me that he shouldn't do any more to it." "Telled you that, did he? I am glad. And that means it's nearly well." "It means it's so far well that I am to exercise it all I can." "Glad of it. But you ought to have telled me. That is good news. But how are you going to exercise it if we are under orders not to go outside this place for fear of the people seeing us and splitting upon the father?" "Yes, that is awkward, Punch." "Awkward! I call it more than awkward, for we did nearly get the poor old chap into a bad scrape that first night. Tell you what, though. You ask Mr Contrabando to come some night and show us the way." "Show us the way where?" "Anywhere. Up into the passes, as he calls them, right up in the mountains, so that we shall know which way to go when we want to join the Bri'sh army." "It would be hardly fair to him, Punch," said Pen. "Never mind that. It would be fair to us, and it would be exercising your leg. Pretty muddle we should be in when the order comes to march and your poor old leg won't go." "Ah, well, we shall see, Punch," said Pen. "Ah, I would; and soon. It strikes me sometimes that he's getting rather tired of his job, him and all his chaps too. I've watched them when they come here of an evening to ask questions of the father and lay their heads together; and I can't understand their jibber-jabber, but it's plain enough to see that they are grumpy and don't like it, and the way they goes on screwing up those bits of paper and lighting up and smoking away is enough to make you ill to watch them. 'Tain't as if they were good honest pipes. Why, they must smoke as much paper as they do 'bacco. Think their captain is going to give it up as a bad job?" "No, Punch." "Well, anyhow, I think you might ask him to take us out with him a bit. If you don't like to do it on account of yourself, because, as you say, he might think it ungrateful, you put it all on to me. Look here. You says, if you can put it into French, as you wouldn't mind it a bit. You says as it's your comrade as wants to stretch his legs awful bad. Yes, and you tell him this too, that I keeps on worrying you about having pins and needles in my back." "Stuff, Punch!" "That it ain't, honour bright. It's lying on my back so much up there in that there cock-loft. It all goes dead-like where the bullet went in. It's just as if it lay there still, and swelled up nearly as big as a cannon ball, and that lump goes all dead and dumb in needles and pins like for ever so long. There, you try it on him that way. You say I'm so sick of it as never was." "And it was only yesterday, Punch, you told me that you were thoroughly happy and contented here, and the country was so beautiful and we were living so well that you didn't mind if we stayed here for months." "'Twaren't yesterday. It was the day before the day before that. You have got all the time mixed up. I don't know where you would have been if I hadn't counted up." "Well, never mind when it was. You can't deny that you said something like that." "Ah, but I wasn't so tired then. I am all right again now, and so are you, and I want to be at it. Who's going to be contented shut-up here like a prisoner?" "Not bad sort of imprisonment, Punch." "Oh no, that's all right enough, comrade; but I want to get back to our chaps. They'll be crossing us off as killed and wounded, and your people at home will be thinking you are dead. I want to get back to the fighting again. Why, if we go on like this, one of these days they will be sarving out the promotions, and then where do we come in? I say, the captain didn't come to see us last week. Think he will to-night?" "I hope so, and bring us news." "So do I. But isn't it about time that Mr Padre came back?" "Must be very near," said Pen. "Quite," said Punch. "He gets all the fun, going out for his walks, a-roving up and down amongst the trees with his book in his hand. Here, if he don't volunteer to take us for a walk--something more than a bit of a tramp up and down in the darkness--I shall vote that we run away. There, if you don't talk to him I shall." "Don't, Punch." "Why not?" "Because I don't want us to seem ungrateful." "Oh, all right then.--I say, here he comes!" cried Punch the next minute; and the old man trudged up to the door with the basket he had taken away empty evidently well-filled again. The priest looked tired as he came in, and according to his custom looked questioningly at the boys, who could only respond with a shake of the head; and this made the old man sigh. "_Paz_!" he said sadly; and, smiling cheerfully, he displayed the contents of his basket, stored the provisions he had brought in, and then according to his wont proceeded to set out the evening meal up in the loft. This meal seemed to have lost its zest to the weary fugitives, and quite late in the evening, when the lads, after sitting talking together in whispers so as not to awaken the priest, who, evidently tired out by his afternoon expedition, had lain down upon the pallet and was sleeping heavily, were about to follow his example for want of something better to do, he suddenly sprang up, ascended to the loft, and told Punch that he was going out again on the watch to see if the friends expected were coming along the pass, and ended by telling them that they had better lie down to rest. "That's settled it for me," said Punch, as the old man went out and closed the door. "I can't sleep now. I want to follow him and stretch my legs." "But you can't do that, Punch." "Ho! Couldn't I? Why, I could set off and run like I haven't done since I was shot down." "But you can't, Punch," said Pen gravely. "It's quite possible that the captain may come and ask where the father is. I think we ought to stay." "Oh, very well, then, we will stop; but I don't call this half living. I want to go and attack somebody or have them attack us. Why, it's like being dead, going on this round--yes, dead, and just as if they had forgot to bury us because they've got too much to do. Are you going to lie down to sleep?" "No," said Pen, "I feel as wakeful as you are." "I say, look at that now! Of course we can't go to sleep. Well, we might have a walk up and down outside in the dark. No one could see us, and it would make us sleepy again." "Very well; only we mustn't go out of sight of the door, in case the captain should come." "Yah! He won't come," grumbled Punch; and he descended to the lower room, scraped the faintly glowing wood-ashes together, and then went to the door, peered out, and listened, and afterwards, followed by his comrade, he began to tramp up and down the shelf-like ledge upon which the priest's cottage was built. It was very dark, for the sky was so overcast that not a star was visible; and, as if feeling depressed by the silence, neither was disposed for talk, and the consequence was that at the end of about half an hour Pen caught his companion by the arm and stopped short. His reason was plain enough, for Punch uttered a faint "Hist!" and led the way to the cottage door, where they both stopped and listened to a sound which had grown plainer--that of steps coming swiftly towards them. They hardly had time to softly close the door and climb up to the loft before the door was thrown open, there was a quick step below, and a soft whistle which they well knew now was uttered at the foot of the steps. Pen replied in the way he had learned, and directly after came the question, "Where's the father?" "He went out an hour ago," Pen replied. "Which way?" "By the upper pass," replied Pen. There was a sharp ejaculation, expressive of impatience, the steps crossed the room again, the door creaked as it was shut to, and then the steps died away. "There, Punch, you see I was right," said Pen. "Who's to see anybody's right when it's as black as your hat?" replied the boy impatiently. "Well, I think it's right if you don't. What shall we do--go to sleep now?" "Go to sleep?" growled the boy irritably. "Go to wake you mean! I tell you what I am just fit for." "Well, what?" said Pen good-humouredly. "Sentry-go. No fear of anybody catching me asleep who came on his rounds. I used to think that was the very worst part of being a soldier, but I could just enjoy it now. 'Tis miserable work, though, isn't it?" "No," replied Pen thoughtfully. "But you get very sleepy over it, don't you?" "I never did," said Pen gravely, as they both settled themselves upon the floor of the loft, and the bundles of straw and dried-fern litter which the priest had added for their comfort rustled loudly while they placed themselves in restful postures. "I used to find it a capital time to think, Punch." "What about?" "The old days when I was a boy at school, and the troubles I had had. Then I used to question myself." "How did you do that?" "How did I do that? Why, I used to ask myself questions as to whether I hadn't done a very foolish thing in enlisting for a soldier." "And then of course you used to say no," cried Punch. "Anybody could answer that question. Why didn't you ask yourself some good tough questions that you couldn't answer--regular puzzlers?" "I always found that puzzle enough, Punch," said Pen gravely; "and I have never been able to answer it yet." "Well, that's a rum un," said Punch, with a sort of laugh. "You have often called me a queer fellow. You do puzzle me. Why, of course you did right. You are not down-hearted because we have had a bit of a venture or two? It's all experience, and you like it as much as I do, even if I do grumble a bit sometimes because it's so dull. Something's sure to turn up before long, and--What did you do that for?" "Pst!" whispered Pen; and Punch was silence itself, for he too caught the hurrying of many feet, and low voices in eager converse coming nearer and nearer; and the next minute there was the heavy thump as of a fist upon the door, which was thrust open so roughly that it banged against the wall. And then midst the sounds of heavy breathing and the scuffling of feet as of men bearing in a heavy burden, the room below seemed to be rapidly filling up, and the door was closed and barred. CHAPTER TWENTY NINE. THE ROYAL VISITOR. The two lads grasped hands as they listened in the intense darkness to what seemed to be a scene of extreme excitement, the actors in it having evidently been hurrying to reach the cottage, which they had gained in a state of exhaustion; for those who spoke gave utterance to their words as if panting and breathless with their exertions, while from their whispering it seemed evident that they were afraid of being overheard. The two listeners dared not stir, for the least movement would have betrayed them to those below, and before many minutes had elapsed they felt certain that the present invaders of the cottage were strangers. All at once some one gave vent to a piteous sigh and an ejaculation or two as if of pain; and this was followed by what sounded to be words that were full of pity and compassion, mingled with great deference, towards the sufferer. Pen could make out nothing more in the hurried and whispered conversation than that it was in Spanish, and for the time being he felt somewhat dazed as to who the new-comers were. He was too much startled to try and puzzle out matters calmly, and for a while he devoted himself to the preservation of utter silence. At last, though, a few more utterances below, spoken in a deferential tone, followed by a sharp, angry command or two, sent a flash through his brain, and he pressed Punch's arm with greater energy in an effort to try and convey to his companion the thought that he knew who the fresh-comers must be. "If they would only strike a light," he thought to himself, "I might get a peep through the knot-hole"--which was always carefully kept clear for inspection of what took place below--"and I could see then at a glance whether this was the expected King with his followers." But the darkness remained profound. "If it is the escaped Spanish King," he said to himself, "it will be plain to see. It must be, and they have been pursued by the French, or they wouldn't be afraid to speak aloud." Then he began to doubt again, for the Spanish King and his followers, who needed a guide to lead them through the intricate passes of the mountains, would not have known their way to the cottage. "Nonsense!" he thought to himself, as fresh doubts arose. "The old priest or the captain must have met them and brought them here." Then all was silent for a time, till it was evident that some one was moving by the fireplace; and then there was the sound of some one blowing. This was followed by a faint glow of light; the blowing sound increased, and it was evident that the wood-ashes possessed sufficient life to be fanned into flame, which increased as the embers were evidently being drawn together by a piece of metal; and before another minute had elapsed Pen made out through the knot-hole that the instrument used for reviving the fire was the blade of a sword. Then some one sighed deeply and uttered a few words in an imperious tone whose effect was to set some one fanning the fire with more energy, when the cracks in the boarded floor began to show, and the watcher above began to get glimpses of those below him. A few minutes later the embers began to crackle, the members of the party below grew more visible, and some one uttered a few words in an eager tone--words which evoked an ejaculation or two of satisfaction, followed by an eager conversation that sounded like a dispute. This was followed by an angry, imperious command, and this again by what sounded to Pen like a word or two of protest. Then the sharp, commanding voice beat down the respectful objection, one of the flaming brands seemed to rise from the hearth, and directly after the smoky wick of the _padre's_ lamp flamed up. And now Pen had a view of the crowded room which completely dashed his belief in the party being the Spanish King and his followers, for he was looking down upon the heads of a gathering of rough-looking, unshorn, peasant-like men, for the most part in cloaks. Some wore the regular handkerchief tied round their heads and had their sombrero hats held in hand or laid by their sides. All, too, were well armed, wearing swords and rough scarves or belts which contained pistols. This scene was enough to sweep away all thought of this being a king and his courtiers, for nothing could have been less suggestive thereof, and the lad looked in vain for one of them who might have been wounded or so wearied out that he had been carried in. Then for a moment Pen let his thoughts run in another direction, but only for a few moments. These were evidently not any of the smuggler's men. He had seen too many of them during his sojourn at the priest's hut not to know what they were like--that is to say, men accustomed to the mountains; for they were all in their way jaunty of mien. Their arms, too, were different, and once more the thought began to gain entrance that his former surmise was right, and that these bearers of swords who had spoken in such deferential tones to one of their party were after all faithful followers or courtiers who had assumed disguises that would enable them to pass over the mountains unnoticed. Which then was the King? "If some of them would speak," said Pen to himself, "it would be easier to tell." But the silence, save for a faint crack or two from the burning wood, remained profound. At last the watcher was beginning to come to a conclusion and settle in his own mind that one of the party who was bending forward towards the fire with his cloak drawn about his face might be the King; and his belief grew stronger as a flickering flame from the tiny fire played upon this man's high boots, one of which displayed a rusty spur. The next minute all doubt was at an end, for one of the men nearest the door uttered a sharp ejaculation which resulted in the occupants of the _padre's_ dwelling springing to their feet. Swords leapt from their scabbards, and some of the men drew their cloaks about their left arms, while others snatched pistols from their belts, and there followed the sharp clicking of their locks. It was evident they were on the alert for anticipated danger, and Pen's eyes glistened, for he could hear no sound. But he noted one thing, and that was that the booted and spurred individual in the cloak did not stir from where he was seated upon the priest's stool by the fire. Then, with a gesture of impatience, Pen saw him throw back his cloak and put his hand to his belt to draw forth a pistol which refused to come. Then with an angry word he gave a fierce tug, with the result that the weapon came out so suddenly that its holder's arm flew up, the pistol exploded with a loud crash, the bullet with which it was loaded passed upward through the boarded ceiling, and Pen started and made a snatch at the spot where his musket was propped up against the wall, while Punch leaped from where he had crouched and came down again upon the ill-fitting boards, which cracked loudly as if the boy were going through. CHAPTER THIRTY. AN AWKWARD POSITION. There was a burst of excitement, hurried ejaculations, and half-a-dozen pistols were rapidly discharged by their holders at the ceiling; while directly after, in obedience to a command uttered by one of the party, a dash was made for the corner door, which was dragged open, and, sword in hand, several of the men climbed to the loft. The boards creaked, there was a hurried scuffle, and first Punch and then Pen were compelled to descend into the room below, dragged before the leader, forced upon their knees, and surrounded by a circle of sword-points, whose bearers gazed at their leader, awaiting his command to strike. The leader sank back in his seat, nursing the pistol he had accidentally discharged. Then with his eyes half-closed he slowly raised it to take aim at Pen, who gazed at him firmly and without seeming to blench, while Punch uttered a low, growling ejaculation full of rage as he made a struggle to escape, but was forced back upon his knees, to start and wince as he felt the point of a sword touch his neck. Then he cried aloud, "Never mind, comrade! Let 'em see we are Bri'sh soldiers and mean to die game." Pen did not withdraw his eyes from the man who held his life in hand, and reached out behind him to grasp Punch's arm; but his effort was vain. Just then the seated man seemed to recollect himself, for he threw the empty pistol upon the floor and tugged another from his belt, cocked it, and then swung himself round, directing the pistol at the door, which was dashed open by the old priest, who ran in and stood, panting hard, between the prisoners and the holder of the pistol. He was too breathless to speak, but he gesticulated violently before grasping Pen's shoulder with one hand and waving the other round as if to drive back those who held the prisoners upon their knees. He tried to speak, but the words would not come; and then there was another diversion, for a fresh-comer dashed in through the open door, and, regardless of the swords directed at him, forced his way to where the prisoners were awaiting their fate. He, too, was breathless with running, for he sank quickly on one knee, caught at the hand which held the pistol and raised it quickly to his lips, as he exclaimed in French: "No, no, your Majesty! Not that!" "They are spies," shouted the tired-looking Spaniard who had given the command which had sent his followers to make the seizure in the loft. "No spies," cried the _contrabandista_. "Our and his Majesty's friends--wounded English soldiers who had been fighting upon our side." There was a burst of ejaculations; swords were sheathed, and the dethroned Spanish monarch uncocked his pistol and thrust it back into his belt. "They have had a narrow escape," he said bitterly. "Why were you not here with the friends you promised?" "They are outside awaiting my orders, your Majesty," said the smuggler bluntly. "May I remind you that you are not to your time, neither have you come by the pass I promised you to watch." "Bah! How could I, when I was driven by these wretched French, who are ten times our number? We had to reach the trysting-place how we could, and it was natural that these boys should be looked upon as spies. Now then, where are you going to take us? The French soldiers cannot be far behind." "No, sire; they are very near." "And your men--where are they?" "Out yonder, sire, between you and your pursuers." "Then are we to continue our flight to-night?" "I cannot tell yet, sire. Not if my men can hold the enemy at bay. It may be that they will fall back here, but I cannot say yet. I did intend to lead you through the forest and along a path I know by the mountain-side; but it is possible that the French are there before us." "And are these your plans of which you boasted?" cried the King bitterly. "No, sire," replied the _contrabandista_ bluntly. "Your Majesty's delay has upset all those." The King made an angry gesticulation. "How could I help it?" he said bitterly. "Man, we have been hemmed in on all sides. There, I spoke hastily. You are a tried friend. Act as you think best. You must not withdraw your help." "Your Majesty trusts me, then, again?" "Trust you? Of course," said the King, holding out his hand, which the smuggler took reverently and raised to his lips. Then dropping it he turned sharply to the priest and the two prisoners. "All a mistake, my friends. There," he added, with a smile, "I see you are not afraid;" and noting Punch's questioning look, he patted him on the shoulder before turning to Pen again. "Where are your guns?" he said. Pen pointed up to the loft. "Get them, then, quickly. We shall have to leave here now." He had hardly spoken before a murmur arose and swords were drawn, for there was a quick step outside, a voice cried "_El rey_!" and one of the smuggler's followers pressed through to whisper a few words. "Ah!" cried the recipient, who turned and said a few words in Spanish to the King, who rose to his feet, drew his rough cloak around him, and stood as if prepared for anything that might come. Just then Pen's voice was heard, and, quite free now, Punch stepped to the door and took the two muskets that were passed down to him. Then Pen descended with the cartouche-boxes and belts, and handed one to Punch in exchange for a musket, and the two lads stood ready. The smuggler smiled approval as he saw his young friends' prompt action, and nodded his head. "Can you walk?" he said. Pen nodded. "And can you fire a few shots on our behalf?" "Try us," replied Pen. "But it rather goes against the grain after what we have received. You only came in time." "Yes, I know," replied the smuggler. "But there are many mistakes in war, and we are all friends now." The _contrabandista_ turned from him sharply and hurried to the door, where another of his followers appeared, who whispered a few words to him, received an order, and stepped back, while his leader turned to the father and said something, which resulted in the old man joining the two lads and pressing their hands, looking at them sadly. The next minute the smuggler signed to them to join his follower who was waiting by the door, while he stepped to the King, spoke to him firmly for a few minutes, and then led the way out into the darkness, with the two English lads, who were conscious that they were being followed by the royal fugitive and his men, out along the shelf in the direction of the forest-path, which they had just gained when a distant shot rang out, to be repeated by the echoes and followed by another and another, ample indication that there was danger very near at hand. The captain said a few words to his follower, and then turned to Pen. "Keep with this man," he said, "when I am not here. I must go back and see what is going on." The lads heard his steps for a minute amongst the crackling husks of the past year's chestnuts and parched twigs. Then they were merged with those of the party following. "I say," whispered Punch, "how's your leg?" "I had almost forgotten it," replied Pen in a whisper. "That's good, comrade. But, I say, all that set a fellow thinking." "Yes; don't talk about it," replied Pen. "All right. But I say, isn't this lovely--on the march again with a loaded gun over your shoulder? If I had got my bugle back, and one's officer alongside, I should be just happy. Think we shall have a chance of a shot or two?" The smuggler, who was leading the way, stopped short and turned upon Punch with a deep, low growl. "Eh?" replied Punch. "It's no good, comrade; I can't understand a word." The man growled again, and laid his hand sharply upon the boy's lips. "Here, don't do that!" cried Punch. "How do I know when you washed that last?" "Be quiet, Punch. The man means we may be nearing the enemy." "Why don't he say so, then?" grumbled Punch; and their guide grunted as if satisfied with the effect of Pen's words, and led on again in and out a rugged, winding path, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, but never at fault in spite of the darkness. Sometimes he stopped short to listen as if to find out how near the King's party were behind, and when satisfied he led on again, giving the two lads a friendly tap or two upon the shoulder after finding that any attempt at other communication was in vain. At last after what must have been about a couple of hours' tramp along the extremely rugged path, made profoundly dark by the overhanging low, gnarled trees, he stopped short again and laid his hand in turn upon the lips of the boys, and then touched Pen's musket, which he made him ground, took hold of his hands in turn and laid them on the muzzle, and then stood still. "What's he up to now?" whispered Punch, with his lips close to his comrade's ear. "I think he means we are to halt and keep guard." "Oh, that's it, is it?" muttered Punch; and he stood fast, while the smuggler patted him on the shoulder and went off quickly, leaving the boys alone, with Punch muttering and fuming in his intense desire to speak. But he mastered himself and stood firm, listening as the steps of the party behind came nearer and nearer till they were close at hand. This was too much for Punch. "Lookye here," he whispered; "they will be ready to march over us directly. How are we going to tell them to halt?" "Be silent. Perhaps they will have the sense to see that they ought to stop. Most likely there are some amongst them who understand French." Pen proved to be right in his surmise, for directly after a portion of the following party were close to them, and the foremost asked a question in Spanish. "_Halte_!" said Pen sharply, and at a venture; but it proved sufficient. And as he stood in the dim, shadowy, overhung path the word was passed along to the rear, and the dull sound of footsteps died out. "Bravo!" whispered Punch. "They are beginning to understand English after all. I say, ain't that our chaps coming back?" Pen heard nothing for a few moments. Then there was the faint crack of a twig breaking beneath some one's feet, and the smuggler who was acting as their guide rejoined them. "_Los Franceses_," said the man, in a whisper; and he dropped the carbine he carried with its butt upon the stony earth, rested his hands upon the muzzle, and stood in silence gazing right away, and evidently listening and keenly on the alert, for he turned sharply upon Punch, who could not keep his tongue quiet. "Oh, bother! All right," growled the boy. "Here, comrade," he whispered to Pen; "aren't these 'ere cork-trees?" "Perhaps. I'm not sure," whispered his companion impatiently. "Why do you ask? What does it matter now?" "Lots. Just you cut one of them. Cut a good big bung off and stuff it into my mouth; for I can't help it, I feel as if I must talk." "Urrrrrrr!" growled the guide; and then, "Hist! hist!" for there was a whispering behind, and directly after the _contrabandista_ captain joined them, to ask a low question in Spanish. "The enemy are in front. They are before us," said the smuggler in French to Pen. Then he spoke to his follower, who immediately began to retrace his steps, while the leader followed him with the two lads, who were led back to where the King was waiting in the midst of his followers; and now a short colloquy took place which resulted in all facing round and following the two smugglers, who retraced their path for the next half-hour, and then suddenly struck off along a rugged track whose difficulty was such that it was quite plain to the two lads that they were striking off right up into the mountains. It was a wearisome route that was only followed with great difficulty, and now it was that Pen's wounded leg began to give him such intense pain that there were moments when he felt that he must break down. But it came to an end at last, just before daybreak, in the midst of what seemed to be an amphitheatre of stones, or what might have been some quarry or place where prospecting had taken place in search of some one or other of the minerals which abounded in parts of the sterile land. And now a halt was made, the smuggler picking out a spot which was rough with bushes; and here he signed to the two lads to lie down and rest, a silent command so welcome that Pen sank at full length at once, the rugged couch seeming to him so welcome that it felt to him like down. A few specks of orange light high up in the sky told that sunrise was very near at hand, and for a few minutes Pen gazed upwards, rapt in wonder by the beauty of the sight. But as he lay and listened to the low murmur of voices, these gradually grew fainter and apparently more distant, while the ruddy specks of light paled and there seemed to be nothing more, for pain and exhaustion had had their way. Thoughts of Spaniards, officers and men, and the _contrabandistas_ with their arms of knife and carbine, were quite as naught, danger non-existent, and for the time being sleep was lord of all. CHAPTER THIRTY ONE. A DREAM OF A RAMROD. It seemed to Pen to be a dream, and then by some kind of mental change it appeared to be all reality. In the first instance he felt that he was lying in the loft over the priest's room, trying to sleep, but he could not get himself into a comfortable position because Punch had gone down below to clean his musket and wanted him to come down too and submit his weapon to the same process. But it had happened that he wanted to go to sleep horribly, and he had refused to go down; with the consequence that as he lay just over the knot-hole Punch kept on poking his ramrod through the opening to waken him up, and the hard rod was being forced through the dry leaves of the Indian corn to reach his leg exactly where the bullet had ploughed, while in the most aggravating way Punch would keep on sawing the ramrod to and fro and giving him the most acute pain. Then the boy seemed to leave off in a tiff and tell him that he might sleep for a month for aught he cared, and that he would not try to waken him any more. Then somehow, as the pain ceased, he did not go to sleep, but went right off up the mountain-side in the darkness, guiding the King and his followers into a place of safety; still it was not so safe but that he could hear the French coming and firing at them now and then. However, he went on and on, feeling puzzled all the time that he should know the way through the mountains so well, and he took the King to rest under the great chestnut-tree, and then on again to where the French were firing, and one of them brought him down with the bullet that ploughed his leg. But that did not seem to matter, for, as if he knew every bit of the country by heart, he led the King to the goat-herd's cottage, and advised him to lie down and have a good rest on the rough bed, because the peasant-girl would be there before long with a basket of food. The King said that he did not care to sleep because he was so dreadfully thirsty, and what he wanted was a bowl of goat's-milk. Then somehow he went to where the goat was waiting to be milked, and for a long time the milk would not come, but when it did and he was trying to fill the little wooden _seau_ it was all full of beautiful cold water from the foot of the falls where the trout were rushing about. Then somehow Punch kept on sawing his ramrod to and fro along the wound in his leg, and the more he tried to catch hold of the iron rod the more Punch kept on snatching it away; and they were going through the darkness again, with the King and his followers close behind, on the way to safety; while Pen felt that he was quite happy now, because he had saved the King, who was so pleased that he made him Sir Arthur Wellesley and gave him command of the British army. Whereupon Punch exclaimed, "I never saw such a fellow as you are to sleep! Do wake up. Here's Mr Contrabando waiting to speak to you, and he looks as if he wanted to go away." "Punch!" exclaimed Pen, starting up. "Punch it is. Are you awake now?" "Awake? Yes. Have I been dreaming?" "I d'know whether you have been dreaming or not, but you have been snoring till I was ashamed of you, and the more I stirred you up the more you would keep on saying, `Ramrod.'" "Bah! Nonsense!" "That's what I thought, comrade. But steady! Here he is again." "Ah, my young friend!" said the _contrabandista_, holding out his hand. "Better after your long sleep?" "Better? Yes," replied Pen eagerly. "Leg's very stiff; but I am ready to go on. Are we to march again?" "Well, no, there's not much chance of that, for we are pretty well surrounded by the enemy, and here we shall have to stay unless we can beat them off." "Where are we? What place is this?" asked Pen rather confusedly. "One of our hiding-places, my friend, where we store up our goods and stable the mules when the pass near here is blocked up by snow or the frontier guards. Well, how do you feel now? Ready to go into hiding where you will be safe, or are you ready to help us against your enemies the French?" "Will there be fighting?" asked Pen eagerly. "You may be pretty sure of that; but I don't want to force you two wounded young fellows into taking part therein unless you are willing." "I am willing," said Pen decisively; "but it's only fair that I should ask my comrade, who is only one of the buglers of my regiment." "Oh, of course," said the smuggler captain, "a non-combatant. He carries a musket, I see, like yourself." "Yes," replied Pen, with a smile, "but it is only a French piece. We belong to a rifle-regiment by rights." "Yes; I have heard of it," said the smuggler. "Well, I will ask him," said Pen, "for he doesn't understand a word we are saying.--Punch," he continued, addressing the boy, "the _contrabandista_ wants to know whether we will fire a few shots against the French who are trying to take the Spanish King." "Where do they want to take him?" cried the boy eagerly. "Back to prison." "Why, of course we will," said the boy sharply. "What do you want to ask that for?" "Because he knows that you are not a private soldier, but a bugle-boy." "Well, I can't help that, can I? I am a-growing, and I dare say I could hit a haystack as well as a good many of our chaps. They ain't all of them so clever because they are a bit older than I am." "Well, don't get into a tiff, Punch. This isn't a time to show your temper." "Who's a-showing temper? I can't help being a boy. What does he want to chuck that in a fellow's teeth for?" "Quiet! Quiet!" said Pen, smiling. "Then I am to tell him that you are ready to have a shot or two at the enemy?" "Well, I do call you a pretty comrade!" said the boy indignantly. "I should have thought you would have said yes at once, instead of parlyvooing about it like that.--Right, sir!" cried the boy, catching up his musket, giving it two or three military slaps, and drawing himself up as if he had just heard the command, "Present arms!" "_Bon_!" said the smuggler, smiling; and he gave the boy a friendly slap on the shoulder. "Ah!" ejaculated Punch, "that's better," as the smuggler now turned away to speak to a group of his men who were standing keeping watch behind some rocks a short distance away.--"I say, comrade--you did tell me once, but I forgetted it--what does _bong_ mean?" "Good." "Ho! All right. _Bong_! I shall remember that next time. Fire a few shots! I am game to go on shooting as long as the cartridges last; and my box is full. How's yours?" "Only half," replied Pen. "Oh, well, fair-play's a jewel; share and share alike. Here, catch hold. That looks like fair measure. We don't want to count them, do we?" "Oh no, that's quite near enough." "Will we fire a few shots at the French?" continued Punch eagerly. "I should just think we will! Father always said to me, `Pay your debts, my boy, as long as the money lasts;' and though it ain't silver and copper here, it's cartridges and--There! Ain't it rum, comrade? Now, I wonder whether you feel the same. The very thought of paying has made the pain in my back come again. I say, how's your leg?" CHAPTER THIRTY TWO. A CAVERNOUS BREAKFAST. "I say, comrade," whispered Punch; "are we going to begin soon?" The boys were seated upon a huge block of stone watching the coming and going of the _contrabandistas_, several of whom formed a group in a nook of the natural amphitheatre-like chasm in which they had made their halt. This seemed to be the entrance to a gully, down which, as they waited, the lads had seen the smuggler-leader pass to and fro several times over, and as far as they could make out away to their left lay the track by which they had approached during the night; but they could not be sure. That which had led them to this idea was the fact that it seemed as if sentries had been stationed somewhere down there, one of whom had come hurriedly into the amphitheatre as if in search of his chief. "I say, comrade," said Punch, repeating his question rather impatiently, "aren't we going to begin soon? I feel just like old O'Grady." "How's that, Punch?" "What he calls `spoiling for a fight, me boy.'" "Oh, you needn't feel like that, Punch," said Pen, smiling. "Well, don't you?" "No. I never do. I never want to kill anybody." "You don't? That ain't being a good soldier." "I can't help that, Punch. Of course, when one's in for it I fire away like the rest; but when I'm cool I somehow don't like the feeling that one has killed or wounded some brave man." "Oh, get out," cried the boy, "with your `killed or wounded some brave man!' They ain't brave men--only Frenchies." "Why, Punch, there are as brave men amongst the French as amongst the English." "Get out! I don't believe that," said the boy. "There can't be. If there were, how could our General with his little bit of an army drive the big army of Frenchies about as he does? Ask any of our fellows, and they will tell you that one Englishman is worth a dozen Frenchies. Why, you must have heard them say so." "Oh yes, I have, Punch," said Pen, laughing, as he nursed his leg, which reminded him of his wound from time to time. "But I don't believe it. It's only bluster and brag, of which I think our fellows ought to be ashamed. Why, you've more than once seen the French soldiers drive our men back." "Well, yes," said Punch grudgingly. "But that's when there have been more of them." "Not always, Punch." "Why is it, then?" "Oh, when they have had better positions and our officers have been outflanked." "Now you are dodging away from what we were talking about," said Punch. "You were saying that you didn't like shooting the men." "Well, I don't." "That's because you don't understand things," cried the boy triumphantly. "You see, although I am only a boy, and younger than you are, I am an older soldier." "Are you, Punch?" said Pen, smiling. "Course I am! Why, you've only been about a year in the regiment." "Yes, about a year." "Well," cried the boy triumphantly, "I was born in it, so I'm just as old a soldier as I am years old. You needn't mind shooting as many of them as you can. They are the King's enemies, and it is your duty to. Don't the song say, `God save the King?' Well, every British soldier has got to help and kill as many enemies as he can. But I say, we are going to fight for the Spanish King, then? Well, all right; he's our King's friend. But where is he now? I haven't seen anything of him this morning. I hope he hasn't run away and left us to do the fighting." "Oh no," said Pen, "I don't think so. Our smuggler friend said we were surrounded by the French." "Surrounded, eh?" cried Punch. "So much the better! Won't matter which way we fire then, we shall be sure to bring some one down. Glad you think the Spanish King ain't run away though. If I was a king I know what I should do, comrade," continued Punch, nursing his musket and giving it an affectionate rub and pat here and there. "Leg hurt you, comrade?" "No, only now and then," said Pen, smiling. "But what would you do if you were a king?" "Lead my army like a man." "Nonsense! What are the generals for?" "Oh, you would want your generals, of course, and the more brave generals the King has--like Sir Arthur Wellesley--the better. I say, he's an Irishman, isn't he?" "Yes, I believe so," replied Pen. "Yes," continued Punch after a minute. "They are splendid fellows to fight. I wonder whether he's spoiling for one now. Old O'Grady would say he was. You should hear him sometimes when he's on the talk. How he let go, my boy, about the Oirish! Well, they are good soldiers, and I wish, my boy, old O was here to help. O, O, and it's O with me, I am so hungry! Ain't they going to give us anything to eat?" "Perhaps not, Punch, for it's very doubtful whether our friends keep their provisions here." "Oh, I say!" cried the boy, with his face resembling that of the brave man in _Chevy Chase_ who was in doleful dump, "that's a thing I'd see to if I was a king and led my army. I would have my men get a good feed before they advanced. They would fight ever so much better. Yes, if I was a king I'd lead my own men. They'd like seeing him, and fight for him all the better. Of course I wouldn't have him do all the dirty work, but--Look there, comrade; there's Mr Contrabando making signals to you. We are going to begin. Come on!" The boy sprang to his feet, and the companions marched sharply towards the opening where the group of smugglers were gathered. "Bah!" ejaculated Punch contemptuously. "What a pity it is! I don't believe that they will do much good with dumpy tools like them;" and the boy literally glared at the short carbines the smugglers had slung across their shoulders. "Of course a rifle would be best, but a good musket and bayonet is worth a dozen of those blunderbusters. What do they call them? Bell-mouthed? Why, they are just like so many trumpet-things out of the band stuck upon a stick. Why, it stands to reason that they can't go bang. It will only be a sort of a _pooh_!" And the boy pursed up his lips and held his hand to his mouth as if it were his lost bugle, and emitted a soft, low note--_poooooh_! "_Dejeuner, mes amis_!" said the smuggler, as the boys advanced; and he led the way past a group of his followers along the narrow passage-like opening to where it became a hewn-out tunnel which showed the marks of picks, and on into a rock-chamber of great extent, in one corner of which a fire was blazing cheerfully, with the smoke rising to an outlet in the roof. Directly after the aromatic scent of hot coffee smote the nostrils of the hungry lads, as well as the aroma of newly fried ham, while away at one side to the right they caught sight of the strangers of the past night, Pen recognising at once the now uncloaked leader who had presented a pistol at his head. "Here, I say," whispered Punch excitedly, "hold me up, comrade, or I shall faint." "What's the matter?" said Pen anxiously. "You feel that dreadful pain again? Is it your wound?" "Pain? Yes," whispered Punch; "but it ain't there;" and he thrust his hand into his pocket to feel for his knife. It was a rough meal, roughly served, but so abundant that it was evident that the smugglers were adepts in looking after the commissariat department. In one part of the cavern-like place the King and his followers were being amply supplied, while right on the other side-- partly hidden by a couple of stacks piled-up in the centre of the great chamber, and formed in the one case of spirit-kegs, in the other of carefully bound up bales that might have been of silk or velvet--were grouped together near the fire some scores of the _contrabandistas_ who seemed to be always coming and going--coming to receive portions of food, and going to make place for others of the band. And it was beyond these stacks of smuggled goods that their _contrabandista_ friend signed to the lads to seat themselves. One of the men brought them coffee and freshly fried ham and cake, which the captain shared with them and joined heartily in the meal. "I say, Pen," whispered Punch, "do tell him in `parlyvoo' that I say he's a trump! Fight for him and the King! I should just think we will! D'ye 'ear? Tell him." "No," said Pen. "Let him know what we feel towards him by what we do, Punch, not what we say." "All right. Have it your own way," said the boy. "But, I say, I do like this ham. I suppose it's made of some of them little pigs we see running about in the woods. Talk about that goat's mutton! Why, 'tain't half so good as ours made of sheep, even though they do serve it out and call it kid. Why, when we have had it sometimes for rations, you couldn't get your teeth into it. Kid, indeed! Grandfather kid! I'm sure of that. I say, pass the coffee, comrade. Only fancy! Milk and sugar too! Oh no, go on; drink first. Age before honesty. I wonder whether this was smuggled.--What's the matter now?" For in answer to a shrill whistle that rang loudly in echoes from the roof, every _contrabandista_ in the place sprang up and seized his carbine, their captain setting the example. "No, no," he said, turning to the two lads. "Finish your breakfast, and eat well, boys. It may be a long time before you get another chance. There's plenty of time before the firing begins, and I will come back for you and station you them in Plattsburgh, they were as sober and polite as though they had been with their mothers all the time. The skipper received his fifteen dollars, and that was all the satisfaction he got out of the cruise. He returned to Burlington the next day, and spent the afternoon in looking for another party at the hotels. There was no more business that week. The next week he got only a half-day job, taking a party of ladies and gentlemen across the lake. Three dollars was all he made that week; and he was beginning to be discouraged when he received a postal from the Witherill House. It was a fishing-party to Mallett's Bay. The young gentlemen from New York were saints compared with his present passengers. They got crazy drunk; and, when a shower came up, they threatened to throw the skipper overboard because he anchored the boat to avoid a squall. Dory was afraid of his life, and five dollars a day was no compensation for the misery he endured. Another week satisfied Dory that the business was a failure, for he did not obtain a single fare. He went to his mother, and told her he had had quite enough of it. He was ready to sell the boat, though the Goldwing Club had fine times in her when she was not engaged; and there were plenty of fine times for them. He had been offered a place in a dry-goods store, and he was willing to take it. "I think you had better see uncle Royal before you take the place," said his mother. "I have never sailed in the Goldwing, and Marian and I would like to have you sail us up to Beech Hill." "What does uncle Royal want me to do, mother?" asked Dory, who suspected that the captain and his mother had something on their minds. "I don't know. You must let him speak for himself," replied Mrs. Dornwood. The next morning Dory took his mother and sister into the Goldwing, and sailed up to Beech Hill. His mother had to act as his pilot, for he did not know how to take the boat from the river to the estate. Leaving Beaver River, he followed a narrow and crooked stream, though it was very deep, till he reached a small lake, on the shore of which stood the house of Captain Gildrock. The party received a warm welcome, and Mrs. Dornwood stated the business that had brought them to Beech Hill. Seated in the library, the great question was opened for discussion and settlement. "Go into a store!" exclaimed Captain Gildrock. "There are more merchants and traders in the country now than can get a living, and mercantile life is a desperate struggle in these days. Be a mechanic, Theodore." "A mechanic!" exclaimed Mrs. Dornwood. "A mechanic, Patty," added the captain decidedly. "The first thing a boy wants is an education, and the next is a good trade. I have been thinking of this subject for years. Now I am going to tell you about my scheme. I want to help supply the country with good, educated mechanics." "I don't think mechanics need much education, Royal," suggested Mrs. Dornwood. "There you are mistaken, Patty. What this country, especially the Eastern and Middle States, needs more than any other class of men, is educated mechanics,--skilled labor. Too many boys want to be shopkeepers, and wear fine clothes." "I should like to be a mechanic, uncle Royal," said Dory. "So would the other members of the Goldwing Club," continued Captain Gildrock. "Now I will tell you about my scheme. For the last year I have had enrolled about a dozen of the young fellows of this vicinity as volunteers on board of the Sylph. Jepson and I have been instructing them in seamanship and mechanics. Jepson has instructed them in the science of the steam-engine, so that they know all about the building of one, though they haven't the practical skill to build one. They have acted as engineers and firemen of the yacht; and every one of them is competent to run a marine engine, or any other." "Those were the young fellows that were pulling your boats that day, were they not?" asked Dory. "They were, Theodore. The only men I employ on board are the cook and a waiter, but I have required every one of these young men to learn to do plain cooking. All of them have served a term in the galley. I am captain, and Jepson is the first officer, of the Sylph. I have taught these students how a vessel or a boat is built, how to sail a boat or a ship; I have instructed them in navigation, and required them to get the latitude and longitude of every principal point on the lake; I have taught them how to heave the log, and keep a vessel's dead reckoning; I have required them to survey portions of the lake, and make charts of their work. They have been greatly interested, and they have profited by their opportunities. Not one of them has rich parents, and all of them must soon earn their own living; and you may be sure that not one of them will be a shopkeeper, a lawyer, a doctor, or a minister." "I should say that was first-rate," added Dory, with enthusiasm. "I suppose some of them will be sailors." "About half of them have a desire to go to sea, and some of them have got places as engineers, oilers, and firemen. Two of them will run stationary engines. I have done with them; for most of them were obliged to go to work, and take care of themselves." "Won't they go in the Sylph any more?" asked Dory. "I have done all I could for them, and so has Jepson. So far as our teaching facilities are concerned, they have learned out. My new scheme contemplates doing the same work in a more thorough and practical manner. The trouble with my past crew was, that I did not have them more than one day in a week; though we occasionally put in a week at a time in vacation, as at the time when I went down the lake to find you. That was their last cruise; and they were discharged, so to speak, two weeks ago." "Are you going to ship another crew like that, uncle Royal?" inquired Dory eagerly. "Not as I did the last one. I am going to establish a sort of practical school," replied the captain. "I should like to ship for one," added Dory. "I have had my eye on the members of the Goldwing Club, for they are just the boys I desire to take. I don't want any sons of rich men. I want those who need looking after, and I think the Goldwings fill the bill. I shall take only half a dozen to begin with. I want them all to come to Beech Hill, and live here. I won't take them on any other terms. I shall look out for their book-learning; but, at the same time, the boys must become carpenters and machinists. They must work at these trades, and others as the plan is enlarged. I shall keep them busy all day long, from one end of the year to the other. We shall build houses, boats, bridges, wharves, and eventually steam-engines, and various kinds of machinery. I expect to see the time, though it may not be for ten years, when we can build a steamer like the Sylph, including her engine, and about every thing on board of her." "It seems to me you are laying out a great undertaking, Royal," said Mrs. Dornwood. "If I can make honest and useful men out of even half a dozen boys like the members of the Goldwing Club, who are in danger of going to ruin, my money will be well spent. A kind Providence permitted me to make a fortune before I was forty-five, though I had to work hard for it. I have no wife, no children. I think I can realize more enjoyment from a portion of my money in this way than I can in any other. It is wholly to my taste and fancy, this scheme of mine; and it holds out to me a thousand times as much pleasure as any business enterprise I can think of. That's the whole of it, Patty." "It is a good deal better to use your fortune in that way than to risk it in speculating in stocks, as a great many rich men do," added Mrs. Dornwood sagely. "But it seems to me that you mean to work the boys very hard,--from morning till night from one year's end to the other." "But I mean that they shall have abundance of recreation. They will be the crew of the Sylph; they shall have hours for their games; they shall have plenty of reading, both for recreation and for study: and if they don't enjoy themselves from morning till night, and from one end of the year to the other, it will be my fault as well as their own." "When will this thing begin?" asked Dory. "I intend to make a beginning by the first of September next. Patty, you must move up to Beech Hill at once, now that Theodore has given up the boating-business. You may tell the other members of the Goldwing Club all about my plan, my boy. I have seen the parents of some of them. They can see their friends as often as they please, and spend Sunday at home if they wish. If you see any other boys like those of your club, you may report them to me; but don't ask them to come to the school, or hold out any inducements to them. I must pick the boys myself." "But I must take time to sell the boat I bought," suggested Dory. "You needn't sell her, Theodore. I have no sailboat of just her size, and she may be useful. Now keep cool, and remember that it will take some time to get the school into running order, and fit up our shops. But we will begin the scholastic work at once, so that the boys will not lose what they have learned in school." Captain Gildrock talked about his plan till dinner-time; and the skipper of the Goldwing was so delighted with it, that he felt as though he wanted to fly. He went all over the estate at Beech Hill, and examined the boats with a professional eye. In the middle of the afternoon the family started for home in the schooner. In the evening Dory went to see all the members of the Goldwing Club, and their eyes were as big as saucers while they listened to the notable scheme of the retired shipmaster. They were quite as enthusiastic as Dory over the idea. The next day their mothers had consented to their joining the embryo school, which was as yet without a name. Mrs. Dornwood gave up her house, and at the end of a week Dory sailed the family up to their new home at Beech Hill. The other boys were to come up on the first day of September, which was two weeks hence. Though the Sylph was without a crew, the captain made up one, and they visited various parts of the lake on business and for pleasure. Mr. Jepson, who had first come to Beech Hill as the engineer of the steam-yacht, resumed his old position. Dory was wheelman, and a couple of men who worked on the place did duty as deck-hands. Dory liked this position as pilot even better than sailing the Goldwing, though his services were often in demand as skipper of the schooner. For more than a year Dory had felt as though he were all adrift in the world. He wanted to get some steady work by which he could help support the family. He had not succeeded very well. But now, for the first time since he had come to think for himself, he did not feel as though he was All Adrift in the world. He was settled with the future before him, and he was resolved that it should be filled with good work. He read in the newspaper that Pearl Hawlinshed had been sent to the state prison for a year and a half; and he could not help thinking what a terrible thing it was for a young man who had a kind and devoted father, whose existence had been bound up in him, to come to a bad end. Dory Dornwood was no longer "All Adrift;" and the Goldwing Club were anchored with him. In another volume we shall look in upon them in their "Snug Harbor" as "The Champlain Mechanics." _YOUNG FOLKS' TROPHIES OF TRAVEL._ OUR BOYS IN INDIA: The Wanderings of two Young Americans in Hindostan, with their exciting adventures on the Sacred Rivers and Wild Mountains.

Cloth, gilt, $2.50. If a handsomer or more enjoyable book for boys has been issued, or is yet to issue, from the press in time for Christmas, we would like to see it. Rob Randall is the name of the boy whose adventures form the material for this story. Rob, like many another boy of his years, has a hankering after travel, and he is destined to get his fill of it. He ships on board a schooner bound to Greenland, is ship-wrecked on the coast of Labrador, visits Iceland, skips down to and through Scotland, England, France, Holland, Russia, Asia, and heaven knows where else besides, until, having travelled this wide world all over, he lights in at last at San Francisco, and finally brings up at his place of beginning--the little village of Stonehaven, on the coast of New England. Rob, in one respect, is like Japhet that Captain Marryatt has written about--he was off on these travels of his in search of his father. The book is full of information, and is written in a style that cannot fail to command the attention of its readers. The scenes which it portrays are illustrated by 200 beautiful pictures.--_Pittsburg Times._ Sold by all Booksellers and Newsdealers.

"Da Gama's history is full of striking adventures, thrilling incidents, and perilous situations; and Mr. Towle, while not sacrificing historical accuracy, has so skilfully used his materials, that we have a charmingly romantic tale."--_Rural New-Yorker._ * * * * * PIZARRO: HIS ADVENTURES AND CONQUESTS. "No hero of romance possesses greater power to charm the youthful reader than the conqueror of Peru. Not even King Arthur, or Thaddeus of Warsaw, has the power to captivate the imagination of the growing boy. Mr. Towle has handled his subject in a glowing but truthful manner; and we venture the assertion, that, were our children led to read such books as this, the taste for unwholesome, exciting, wrong-teaching boys' books--dime novels in books' clothing--would be greatly diminished, to the great gain of mental force and moral purpose in the rising generation."--_Chicago Alliance._ * * * * * MAGELLAN; OR, THE FIRST VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD. "What more of romantic and spirited adventures any bright boy could want than is to be found in this series of historical biography, it is difficult to imagine. This volume is written in a most sprightly manner; and the life of its hero, Fernan Magellan, with its rapid stride from the softness of a petted youth to the sturdy courage and persevering fortitude of manhood, makes a tale of marvellous fascination."--_Christian Union._ * * * * * MARCO POLO: HIS TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES. "The story of the adventurous Venetian, who six hundred years ago penetrated into India and Cathay and Thibet and Abyssinia, is pleasantly and clearly told; and nothing better can be put into the hands of the school boy or girl than this series of the records of noted travellers. The heroism displayed by these men was certainly as great as that ever shown by conquering warrior; and it was exercised in a far nobler cause,--the cause of knowledge and discovery, which has made the nineteenth century what it is."--_Graphic._ * * * * * RALEGH: HIS EXPLOITS AND VOYAGES. "This belongs to the 'Young Folks' Heroes of History' series, and deals with a greater and more interesting man than any of its predecessors. With all the black spots on his fame, there are few more brilliant and striking figures in English history than the soldier, sailor, courtier, author, and explorer, Sir Walter Ralegh. Even at this distance of time, more than two hundred and fifty years after his head fell on the scaffold, we cannot read his story without emotion. It is graphically written, and is pleasant reading, not only for young folks, but for old folks with young hearts."--_Woman's Journal._ * * * * * DRAKE: THE SEA-LION OF DEVON.

PREFACE. "All Taut" is the fifth volume of "THE BOAT-BUILDER SERIES," which will be finished in the next book. Nearly all the characters presented, and all who take prominent parts in the story, have been introduced in the preceding volumes. The principal of the Beech Hill Industrial School entertains some doubts in regard to the principle upon which he has been conducting the institution, and brings about a partial change in its character. He is a firm believer in the utility of the school as he has organized it; and, apart from its industrial mission, he believes it may accomplish another purpose that will render it still more valuable to the community in which he resides. The founder of the school has demonstrated to his own satisfaction, to say the least, that the institution is a practicable cure for some of the evils of American society; and he adds to it the feature of making it partly reformatory. The subjects of his new experiment in this direction are the Topovers, who have been the bad characters of the story. He finds them more tractable than he had anticipated, and the story will show with what results he applied the naval discipline of the school to them. In spite of the rather formidable reformatory plan of Captain Gildrock, the book contains about the same amount of incident and adventure as its predecessors in the series; but they are events which forward the action of the principal, and illustrate his method of reforming bad boys. The Lily is rigged, and makes a very good record as a fast sailer on the lake. The principal, though the actual work to be done by the students is only to rig a fore-and-aft schooner, explains to them the different kinds of vessels, classed by their rig, and fully illustrates the system by which the spars, rigging, and sails of a ship are named, so that he makes quite an easy matter of it for the boys. The next and last volume of the series will be devoted to the sailing of boats; though, as in the other books, the subject will be amplified so as to include nautical manœuvres of larger vessels.

"What's the use of rigging the boat, Tom Topover?" demanded Ash Burton, with no little disgust apparent in his tones and looks. "How can you sail the boat if she isn't rigged, Ash?" retorted Tom, who had always been the leader of the "dangerous class" of boys in Genverres. "We don't want to sail her; we can't sail her in this creek," replied Ash Burton, who seemed to be inclined to dispute the authority and reject the leadership of the Topover. "What's the reason we can't?" asked Tom, suspending his labors upon an old stick which was to serve as a mast for the craft they were getting ready for service. "Because there is no room up here to sail a boat. This creek is not more than ten feet wide, and the wind is blowing directly up stream. It is half a mile to Beechwater, as the fellows in the Industrial School call it. The current will carry us down with only a little steering." "What are we going to do when we get to the little lake? We have nothing but a couple of pieces of boards for oars, and we can't do nothing rowing," argued Tom Topover. "All we want to do in this tub is to get down to the grove, and then we shall be all right," added Ash Burton warmly. "We are going to sail down," persisted Tom; not that he cared how the craft was propelled through the water, but because he always wanted his own way, and that his word should be law to his companions. "You don't know how to sail her after you get her rigged," said Ash, with no little contempt in his tone. "You do, and that's enough. When we get her into the water, your work will begin, and mine will end." Ash Burton had recently moved to Genverres from Westport, where he had sailed in a boat a few times, and claimed to know something about the management of one. Half a dozen boys had gathered on the bank of the creek; and they were all the associates, more or less, of Tom Topover, Nim Splugger, Kidd Digfield, and boys of that stamp. They had heard a great deal about the building of the Lily, the schooner which had been launched by the students of the Beech Hill Industrial School just before the end of the term. The people of the town had talked a great deal about it, and most of them were interested to see her rigged and sailing in the waters of the river and lake. It was well understood that the rigging of the boat was the first thing in order after the school was re-organized in the month of September. The young ladies in Genverres, and others who had attended the launch, which had been one of the great occasions of the year, had talked with the students; and "rigging the boat" was still the subject of conversation among them. Of course the boys did more talking on this subject than all others. Tom Topover had seen the launch, and heard the subject of rigging the new craft discussed. He was inspired to do something of the same kind, and this explained his persistency in part. It was the last week in August, and in two weeks the industrial school would be open again; but the students who went to their homes had not yet returned, and every thing was very quiet about the grounds and buildings. A few boys who had no homes, or had them in the immediate vicinity, spent a good deal of their time in the Sylph, the steam-yacht of the principal, Captain Gildrock. Dory Dornwood had preferred to remain at home with his mother and sister, at the mansion of his uncle the captain. He made a call as often as it was decent for him to do so, at the cottage of Mr. Bristol on the bank of the creek. Miss Lily Bristol, the daughter of the engineer who lived there, was acknowledged everywhere to be a remarkably pretty girl, about Dory's own age. Dory was a great character at the school, and he was now the captain of the Sylph when the institution was in session. He was by no means a fighting character, though he had been in some hard battles with students and others, and his prowess possibly had something to do with his popularity in school and out. During the vacation, the Sylph was in service a great part of the time. As she went somewhere nearly every day except Sunday, Dory had frequent occasion to go to the cottage to give the engineer his orders for the next day. His message to the father was generally coupled with an invitation to Lily and her mother to join the party. Besides, Lily had a brother who had won distinction among the students for certain battles he had fought with Major Billcord and his son Walk. Under Dory's direction, the students had moved the cottage in which the Bristols lived, from Sandy Point to its present location; and this event, in one way and another, had led to a very close intimacy between the young captain of the Sylph and Paul Bristol, Lily's brother. Perhaps Dory wished to see his friend very often; at any rate, he went to the cottage about every day in the week. Some of the students, and even his sister Marian, were disposed to laugh at him for his frequent visits; but Dory never admitted, even to himself, that he went to see Lily. Being quite young, it is probable that he did not understand the matter very well, and was ignorant of what it was that attracted him to the cottage. Tom Topover and his followers had been hearing all the talk in the town,—at school, at the taverns, and in the shops,—about the doings at the Industrial School. They had been inclined to imitate, in their own way, the operations of the students on the water. They had endeavored to get into various quarrels with them, sometimes for the simple fun of bothering and annoying them, and sometimes for the purpose of getting possession of their boats. Twice they had stolen the long barges; and once, when they were assisted by the students of the Chesterfield Collegiate Institute, they had given the owners a great deal of trouble in recovering the property of the school. It is not strange that the frequent view of so many elegant boats on the river and lake inspired them to imitate their more fortunate neighbors in the sports of the water. Tom and his companions believed that the students and their principal were especially mean and selfish, in keeping all these elegant boats exclusively for their own use. He had done his best in trying to be civil, and even polite, in making his request, for himself and his associates, for the use of some of the boats for an hour or two. He had always been refused; for they were not competent to manage such craft, in the first place, and the principal had no fancy for indulging bad boys. Being unable to obtain the use even of the four-oar rowboats of the institution, though it was vacation, they had constructed a flat-bottomed affair, which they called a boat, but to which no one else would have had courtesy enough to apply the term. It had been constructed under the direction of Ash Burton, who was certainly a higher grade of boy than the original Topovers; but it may be doubted if his standard of morals was any more elevated. He had been well educated so far, and was now in the high school. The Topovers were enterprising and daring; and this fact, rather than their coarse manners and disregard of the laws of God and man, had drawn him to them. With him in tone and manners were half a dozen other boys like him, who had joined the Topovers. The old leader had been in some bad scrapes, and the people were generally sorry that he had not been convicted for his assault upon Paul Bristol, on the other side of the lake. They believed, that, in their own State, he would have been sent to a correctional institution. The addition of boys like Ash Burton and Sam Spottwood had greatly changed the character of the original band. Hearing some of their number speak good English, had led them to improve their own language. But morally, they probably dragged down the recruits quite as much as the latter elevated them. On the whole, however, the tone of the crowd was improved. The thing they called a boat had been built, and launched with some of the show which had attended the advent of the Lily into her destined element. The next thing in order, according to Tom's idea, was to rig her. It would not be proper to make an excursion in her, if she would float with half a dozen of them in her,—which had yet to be demonstrated,—until she had been rigged. The leader and some of the others had brought such bits of line as they could lay their hands upon, not always with a strict regard to the rights of property. Ash Burton and Sam Spottwood did not believe in this folly, and they were disposed to rebel against the chief of the Topovers. The old sheet which Tom had brought for a sail would be as useless as a steam-engine without a propeller, in going down Beech Creek. "If you want to rig her, go ahead, Tom," said Ash, when he had exhausted his arguments against the plan. "Sam and I will wait until you do the job." "But I don't know how," added Tom. "I never had any thing to do with sailboats." "Let him have his own way, Ash," suggested Sam Spottwood, in a low voice. "Help him out, and we shall get off all the sooner." The new boat was not only to be rigged that day, but she was to convey her builders down the stream to the lake. Tom had hacked out a boom and gaff, and had set up the crooked stick which was to serve as a mast. One of the boys had to devote himself all the time to the work of baling out the leaky craft, while another was punching cotton-wool into the gaping seams, and plastering them over with putty. The mast-hole was so large that the spar would not stand up; and Ash rigged a pair of shrouds to support it in place. The sail had already been bent on the boom and gaff in a very unnautical manner, and a few minutes served to attach it to the mast. The master rigger on this occasion was not disposed to waste any time on the rigging; and the gaff was not made to hoist and lower, but was simply tied to the top of the mast. A piece of bed-cord was fastened to the boom, to serve as the main sheet, and the craft was ready for sea. But the calker had not yet finished his labors, and Sam Spottwood assisted him. The cotton had but a light hold on the wood, in the wideness of the seams, but the putty kept it in place. In another half-hour, the workmen declared that the boat was tight, and would keep dry, even in a heavy sea, out in the great lake. Ash Burton had some doubts on this point, but he said nothing. If they all got overboard, it would be easy enough to get out of the creek, it was so narrow. "Is every thing all right now?" asked Tom Topover, in a tone of authority, when the calker announced that his job was finished. "Every thing is all right," replied Kidd Digfield, who had used the cotton and putty. "The boat is all ready." Tom proceeded to take his place at the stern. CHAPTER II. THE VOYAGE OF THE THUNDERER. "Who is to be the captain of this craft, Tom?" asked Ash Burton, when the leader of the gang had taken his place at the post of honor. "I am, of course," replied Tom, opening his mouth from ear to ear in a grin which was intended to express his astonishment that any one should put such a question to him. "All right," added Ash, with a nod of his head in addition to emphasize his consent; "we will all obey your orders." "Of course you will. In a boat there can be only one head, and others must do as the captain says," continued the self-appointed skipper. "You are exactly right there, Tom. On board of the Sylph a fellow is not allowed to say his soul is his own; and if he disobeys the orders of his superior officer, he is shut up in the dark, or something of that sort." "That's the right way to do it," argued Tom. "If a fellow won't mind the captain, he ought to be shut up, and kept there till he is willing to mind." "We shall all mind," said Ash; but some of his companions could not help noticing a sort of chuckle as he spoke. As no one said any thing more on the subject, and all seemed to agree that he should be the captain, Tom proceeded to station his ship's company in the boat. He ordered Ash to take a place beside him in the stern. There was no more than room enough for the six boys, and certainly none for as many more who had taken part in the building of the boat, but were not present at the rigging of the craft. The Thunderer—for that was the name Tom had given her in spite of the protest of Ash and Sam, who wanted to call her the Boxer, perhaps as a compliment to the leader of the party, but more probably because she was more like a box than a boat—had her bow on the sand at the bank of the creek. Tom directed Sam Spottwood, who was in the forward part of the boat, to shove her off. The boy addressed had a piece of board in his hand, and he obeyed the order. The clumsy craft slid off the sandbank into the water. The six stout boys in her settled her down so, that Tom began to manifest some signs of timidity; but when she had reached her bearings she did very well, and rested like a log on the water. The hills and trees on each side sheltered the creek in this place from the breeze that was blowing, and the sail hung idly from the gaff. The boat was provided with a rudder moved by a tiller thrust into a half-inch auger-hole. It was sufficient to move the rudder, and that was all that was expected of it. Tom thought that the boat was a decided success, as she had not yet spilled them out into the creek. The current of the stream was strong enough to set the craft in motion, and she began her maiden voyage down to the little lake. But she did not pay proper allegiance to her helm, in spite of all the twisting and jerking that Tom bestowed upon the innocent tiller, which was not at all responsible for the erratic course of the Thunderer. She bunted on the sandbars, and even poked her blunt nose into the banks as if she were hunting for muskrats. "There is some mistake about this boat," said Tom, when he had exhausted his strength and his patience in vain attempts to bring the craft to some definite course. "What is it, Captain Topover?" asked Ash, winking slyly to Sam in the bow. "That's more than I know, for every thing seems to be all right about her. The rudder moves when I shift the tiller, but she don't mind it no more than a naughty boy minds his mother," replied Tom, looking over the boat in his efforts to ascertain what the matter was. Just at that moment, the obdurate Thunderer was whirled by an eddy in the current, and thrown against a log of wood projecting from the bank. She canted over, and Kidd Digfield sprang to his feet. It looked as though the boat were going to spill them all out, but she did not: on the contrary, she rebounded from the obstacle, and went whirling on her way down the stream. "Sit down, Kidd Digfield!" shouted Tom imperatively. "You have been in a boat enough to know better than to stand up in that fashion. No fellow is to get on his feet, whatever happens." The skipper had learned this from the discipline of the students, with some of whom he had conversed; and he had often been near enough to their boats to learn something of the way in which they managed them. "That's right, Captain Topover," said Ash approvingly. "A fellow that stands up without orders in such a craft as this ought to be thrown overboard." "No matter what happens, no fellow must get on his feet," repeated Tom sternly. "It won't do." "Suppose the thing upsets or sinks, are we to keep our seats?" asked Kidd, more to bother his commanding officer than for any other reason. "When it comes to that, it is another thing," replied Tom, with all the dignity he could manage to muster. "Obey the orders of your captain; and when he gets on his feet, it will be time enough for you to do so." The Thunderer continued to wander and whirl in the current and the eddies, in spite of the best skill of the skipper to prevent it. Ash Burton knew very well what the matter was, but he did not think it proper for a simple sailor to give advice or instruction to the high and mighty captain. Tom was the captain, and it devolved upon him to manage the Thunderer as he thought best. The boat whirled entirely around sometimes, rudder or no rudder; and Tom did not know what to make of it. He had never seen a boat act so before, and he was sure that none of the school navy behaved in such an unaccountable manner. The progress of the expedition was very slow; and the skipper declared that it would take all day to get to Beechwater at this rate, to say nothing of Lake Champlain, upon whose waves they desired to navigate the Thunderer. "I say, Sam Spottwood, just use that board of yours a little, and keep the boat from twisting about like a ram's horn," said Tom, when he could devise no other expedient for keeping the boat in a direct course. "What am I to do with it?" asked Sam, who had some idea of what had been passing in the mind of Ash. "When you see her whirling about, just stick the board on the bottom, or against the bank, and push her round," added Tom. Sam obeyed the order when the bow came near enough to the bank for him to touch it. But when he attempted to reach the bottom of the creek, the water was too deep for the length of his stick. The boat whirled again, and Tom reproved the hand forward for not preventing it. "I can't touch bottom with this oar," replied Sam. "I can only use it when she runs into the bank." The Thunderer was approaching the stone-quarries, and the creek was wider and deeper than where they had embarked. Tom could give no further orders to remedy the difficulty, and the craft continued to waltz on her course. When they had gone a short distance farther, a slight breeze from behind Beech Hill filled the sail. In that turn of the stream it happened to be fair, and the boat began to move more rapidly through the water. There was no more trouble about the steering at that moment; for, as soon as she had steerage-way, there was something for the rudder to act against. "That's the talk!" exclaimed Tom, when he saw the Thunderer behaving like a proper and obedient Thunderer. "She has got over that bad trick, and she steers like a lady now." The craft reached the hill, and again she was left in a calm. Not a particle of breeze came to fill the sail, and she began to gyrate as she had done before. Tom was vexed; and he tried in vain to solve the mystery, while Ash chuckled at the ignorance and stupidity of the captain of the Thunderer. Passing the Bristol cottage, which seemed to be closed up, they came into Beechwater. There was a little breeze on the lake, and the sail filled again. But the wind did not come from the same direction as before; and after the sheet—not the main sheet, but the bed-sheet doing duty as a mainsail—had filled once, it refused to fill again. It had been trimmed at random, and was not in position to profit by the light air that came to it. Ash Burton laughed in his sleeve, and winked at Sam Spottwood. As the Thunderer had passed out of the current, or where the force of it was diffused through the whole breadth of the lake, she ceased to move at all, so far as her gallant skipper could discern. "Are we going to stop for dinner here?" asked Ash, with another wink at Sam. "That sail keeps flapping, and there is wind enough; but the boat don't seem to go at all," replied the perplexed commander of the Thunderer. "I wonder what's the matter with her?" "The captain of the vessel ought to know what ails her," added Ash. "Well, I don't know; and she won't move at all," added the skipper. "Do you know what ails her, Ash Burton?" "I don't pretend to know any thing at all about it, and I only obey the captain's orders," answered Ash, winking again at his crony forward. "If you want to tell me any thing about the matter, I am ready to hear you," continued the captain, nonplussed at the situation. "I don't want to tell you a single word. I know my place better than to do such a thing. It would be nothing less than mutiny for me to presume to tell the commander of the vessel what to do." "We will let up a little on that," added Tom, with a grin, which was his apology for receding from his position. "Can you tell me what the matter is?" "I cannot, but I am ready to obey orders," replied Ash. Tom Topover took hold of the main sheet,—not the bed-sheet this time, but the rope,—and pulled the boom towards him. He had done so in the process of his investigation, rather than to accomplish any movement. But the effect was the same as though he had done it on purpose. The moment he hauled in the sail, the wind filled it, and the boat began to go ahead again. Tom was not a fool in all branches of human action, and he could not help seeing how he should keep the sail full. He made fast the sheet; and the boat continued to go ahead, till she was within a short distance of the Goldwing, Dory Dornwood's sloop-yacht. "Run for the shore, Tom!" suddenly shouted Nim Splugger, who was seated in the middle of the craft. "What's the matter with you, Nim?" demanded the skipper. "The putty and cotton is coming out of the cracks, and the boat will be full of water in about two minutes," added Nim. "That's so!" yelled Kidd. "The water is pouring in like a mill-stream, and we shall be in the lake in a couple of minutes." The two minutes had not elapsed when the boat was half full, and she rolled over as gently as though she had been a log. CHAPTER III. A QUESTION DEBATED AND SETTLED. The Thunderer had foundered; but not being provided with ballast she did not go to the bottom, as it is set down in poetry and prose that she should do when she fills with water. All the Topovers of the present party had been educated in the manly sports of the locality, and they could all swim. The disaster was not, therefore, a very appalling catastrophe. But they were not required to swim any great distance, and the useful art they had acquired was of more service in enabling them to retain their self-possession than for the purpose of reaching the shore. The clumsy craft went stories.” “I thought scouts were a thing of the past!” exclaimed Frank. “So they are,” said Mr. Mackworth, “the kind that used to guard the emigrant trains and early railway surveyors. But Sam is a ‘game scout’ now. We’ll have Sam to smell out the sheep and goats.” The next morning the travelers were in St. Paul and after a ride through Minnesota the train reached Moorhead almost on time. The stop here was only a few minutes but, although all the Teton’s passengers were out and on the lookout, Sam Skinner was nowhere in sight. “Don’t be alarmed,” said Mr. Mackworth, as the train started again. “He’s on board. I’ll search the train.” In ten minutes Mr. Mackworth reëntered the car, where dinner had just been announced, with the much discussed Sam close behind. The new arrival carried in one hand a rope tied fibre suit case, crushed and worn. In the other was a short rifle and a cartridge belt. His teeth were set on a short, nicked, black pipe. Frank and Phil were shocked. Aside from the rifle and belt, nothing suggested the old time hunter. And the man, although probably seventy years old, was in no sense “grizzled.” He did not even wear the greasy old sombrero with which all western veterans of fiction are crowned. “Gentlemen, let me introduce Sam Skinner,” exclaimed Mr. Mackworth. “Pleased to meet you,” said Sam, who in the books should have grunted or said “howdy.” Then, turning to Mr. Mackworth, Sam continued: “Colonel, you’re goin’ to find a lot of snow up there in the Elk River Valley Mountains. Did you bring your snowshoes?” “Snow ain’t goin’ to bother us this time,” said Mr. Mackworth, significantly. “We thought we’d come early and maybe scare up a few grizzlies.” “You’ll do that, I reckon,” exclaimed Sam, “but the best time to tackle the timber line is September. There’s a power o’ snow in the gullies just now.” By this time Jake Green had relieved the westerner of his rifle and box, and Sam had removed his hat and pipe. “Here’s the same old hat, Colonel, you gave me four years ago and good as new.” He held out a limp, cloth traveling hat that had probably cost a pound in London. Mr. Mackworth apparently did not recall the incident and Sam continued: “Don’t you remember the day I lost my hat over on Avalanche Creek, near Herchmer Mountain; the day we thought we had Old Indian Chief at last?” Mr. Mackworth’s eyes lit up. “Sure,” he said, “and you nearly broke your neck at the same time. I wonder if the ‘Chief’ has fallen a victim to anyone yet?” “I ain’t been in the valley for four years,” responded Sam. “But I reckon’ he ain’t and never will. I kind o’ believe he ain’t nothin’ but a ghost anyway.” Every one had pricked up his ears. Captain Ludington especially seemed to be no less curious about Old Indian Chief than Frank and Phil. “What’s that?” broke in Phil. “Sam’ll tell you, sometime,” explained Mr. Mackworth, “but let’s have dinner now. It’s sort of a myth of the mountains. Every one tells it and each one a different way.” “About goats?” persisted Phil. “About a great Bighorn sheep,” added Mr. Mackworth. “But where does the Indian part come in?” insisted Phil. “Now I’m not going to try to piece together an old camp-fire tale,” exclaimed Mr. Mackworth, “especially when I’m hungry. But here’s the chapter heading of it, as you might say. For twenty-five years the Indians and old-time hunters of the Selkirk Mountain and Kootenai River region have circulated a picturesque tale of a hermit Indian, a kind of a spirit savage who, with a monster Bighorn ram always at his heels, is seen now and then by some hunter but never overtaken.” “And who escapes up almost unscalable cliffs by hanging on to the ram’s horns,” broke in Captain Ludington. “Then you’ve read the legend,” exclaimed Mr. Mackworth with awakening interest. “I heard it a few years ago at Glacier,” explained the captain. “Young gentlemen,” he added wheeling toward Frank and Phil, “that’s the story I meant to tell you sometime――‘The Monarch of the Mountains.’ Now I give way to Mr. Skinner. Let’s hear the real story,” he suggested, looking toward the new arrival. “By no means,” ordered Mr. Mackworth instantly. “Not, at least, until we reach our coffee. You have before you a saddle of roast mutton that I personally selected yesterday in Chicago. It demands your exclusive attention. I got it that you may be able to distinguish between the flavor of it and the haunch of young mountain sheep that Mr. Skinner is sure to provide for us in a few days.” Frank was already smacking his lips in anticipation of that game dinner in camp. Already he could see Jake Green at work over the camp fire basting a roast of mountain sheep. By this time all were seated, Sam Skinner included. “Sam,” exclaimed Mr. Mackworth, “as a special and honored guest this evening, let me serve you a cut of this mutton. It’s English Southdown.” “English or French,” replied Sam slowly and hesitatingly, “it don’t make no difference. You’ll have to excuse me, Colonel. Young mountain sheep is certainly eatable after a fellow’s been livin’ on salt pork――and little of that――for two or three weeks. But, to speak right out, I ain’t much for sheep if there’s anything else on hand and I see there’s a plenty.” “Then you don’t care for sheep roasted over a camp fire way up among the pines where you’ve chased your game all day?” suggested Lord Pelton, while all laughed. “Sure,” was Sam’s quick response. “That’s regular and proper. But I’m speakin’ o’ times when you can have your choice. Them goat steaks and bear ribs is all O. K. when you’re in camp. But give me my choice and I’ll say they ain’t nothin’ finer nor sweeter than a big, thick, round steak fried on a cook stove with plenty o’ milk gravy to come.” “Jake,” ordered Mr. Mackworth at once and without a trace of a smile, “fry a porterhouse steak for Mr. Skinner and smother it with gravy.” Being a Canadian Sam had another peculiarity. He cared nothing for coffee. Therefore, with his fried steak, came a pot of black tea. Dinner under way at last the story of Old Indian Chief, or the Monarch of the Mountains, again became the center of conversation. Sam was urged to give his version of the tale and he, in turn, was as eager to hear Captain Ludington’s story. With many interruptions and cross suggestions, each man told the legend as he had heard it. The “Monarch of the Mountains,” as related by the English officer――and both stories were unquestionably different versions of the same tale――had its origin among the Kootenai Indians. “The big Indian in the story, as it was told to me,” said Captain Ludington referring to a little notebook, “was named Koos-ha-nax. He was a Kootenai and his tribe, twenty years ago, was living in the Selkirk Mountains northwest of Kootenai Lake. Koos-ha-nax was neither chief nor medicine man but a mighty hunter in the mountains. In addition he was a thief. Being a skilful hunter his stealing was for a long time overlooked. But, at last, Koos-ha-nax’s thefts overbalancing the food he supplied, the thieving hunter was summoned to trial. Being found guilty he was condemned to die. Thereupon, he made a speech. “It was then, and is now, a tradition of the Kootenais that the mountain sheep is the king of all animals and that the mountain goat is second in command. In the earliest days the Indians assert these animals did not confine themselves to the peaks and highest ridges of the mountains as now, but ranged the valleys and wooded foothills. Then a war broke out between the sheep and goats and, led by Husha the Black Ram and Neena the White Goat, they separated――the sheep to the north and the goats to the south. “‘Koos-ha-nax knows this well,’ spoke the hunter. ‘And so long as Husha the Black Ram and Neena the White Goat lead the sheep and the goats, so long will the hunting grounds of the Kootenai know them not. To follow Husha the Black Ram and Neena the White Goat into the sky itself may mean death. But I, Koos-ha-nax, the mighty hunter, have talked with the sheep and the goats; Koos-ha-nax has seen Husha the Black Ram and Neena the White Goat; Koos-ha-nax has seen the great horns of Husha the Black Ram, and they are wide as the span of a man’s arms; Koos-ha-nax has seen the black horns of Neena the White Goat, and they are keen and sharp as the spear of the fisher; Koos-ha-nax asks for his life, not that he fears death, but that he may travel far to the north and to the south and bring to his people the horns of Husha the Black Ram, and of Neena the White Goat.’ “This offer of the great hunter,” went on Captain Ludington, “was gladly accepted on the theory that in the death of Husha and Neena, the sheep and the goats might be reconciled and subsequently return to the valleys――the more convenient hunting grounds of the Indians. There seems to be some basis for this part of the legend,” explained Captain Ludington, “for I am told that the Indians are, even to-day, notoriously bad hunters of these animals and seldom pursue them further than their ponies can ascend the mountains. Having been granted his life on these terms, Koos-ha-nax, armed with his bow and arrows, disappeared and never returned. Wandering Indians brought tales at times of seeing the mighty hunter in the far north; others caught sight of him in the south. When the ice cracked on the glaciers it was Koos-ha-nax in pursuit of Husha; when the snow avalanches fell in the south it was Koos-ha-nax chasing Neena. Children are taught to-day that a loose boulder bounding down the mountain side is hurled by Koos-ha-nax, the hunter. And, whenever a herd of sheep or goats is sighted in full flight, close behind follows the ghostly form of the ceaseless hunter. “Since every legend has its variation,” continued Captain Ludington, “so has that of Koos-ha-nax. Advanced thinkers among the Kootenais will tell you that Koos-ha-nax never tried to find and kill Husha and Neena. By these wiseacres Koos-ha-nax is credited with the power of understanding and talking to the sheep and goats. They will tell you that the great hunter left his people with no other intent than to live with the sheep and goats. Some have had distant glimpses of the exiled Indian lying with his animal friends on rocky heights, or rushing up almost inaccessible slopes assisted by old Husha or Neena――as the narrator lives in the north or south. But others say Koos-ha-nax will again return and, when he does, that the hunting grounds will again be thick with the now rapidly disappearing mountain sheep and goats. In any event,” laughed Captain Ludington, “they tell me that if you are hunting with Kootenai guides you will always be short of the big prize, unless you can capture old Husha the Black Ram, or Neena the White Goat.” It was now old Sam Skinner’s turn, but the old man hesitated. “I never heard no such tale as that,” he said at last being plentifully urged to give his version. “All I ever heard was some Sioux Indians chinnin’, but it wasn’t about no Koos-what-do-you-call-him. And I never heard ’em have no names like what you said for the rams and goats. But they was an Old Indian Chief that they used to talk about that had some trouble and was kicked out o’ the tribe, and they make out as how he took to the mountains and lived like a hermit. And they do say he got on such good terms with the mountain animals that the sheep and goats all followed him and that that’s why there ain’t no more sheep down there in the buttes o’ Montana. But the stories are sort o’ like in one way. Whenever a Sioux gets sight o’ a Bighorn ram with shiny black horns they say it’s Old Indian Chief, and I reckon they is some o’ them Indians yet livin’ who think Old Indian Chief that was kicked out o’ the tribe is a livin’ up in the Columbia Rockies.” “Hold on there, Sam,” laughed Mr. Mackworth. “Didn’t you tell me, when we were chasin’ sheep and a loose rock would come tumbling down the mountain side: ‘look out――Old Indian Chief may be up there protecting his friends!’” “Well,” acknowledged Sam somewhat abashed, “the Indians are always talkin’ that way. But that’s what they call all the big rams and goats, too. If that Kootenai Kooshaynix and the Sioux is the same, I reckon he’s froze stiff long ago and it’s his ghost that’s a heavin’ rocks and glacier ice and startin’ avalanches――” “But,” interrupted Frank, all aglow with interest and excitement, “do you really believe there was such an Indian, really and truly? It’s like Mowgli in the Jungle tales!” “Of course not,” replied Mr. Mackworth. “The tale means only this: Sheep and goats were once plentiful in all these mountains. They began to disappear. The Indians must have an explanation for everything. They imagined a cause and made it human――a man led them away. That’s all.” “I’m sorry,” said Phil. “I mean I’m sorry there is no Husha the Black Earn, or Neena the White Goat. I’m sure we could find one or the other. And I always like things with a story to them.” “Well,” laughed Lord Pelton, who was no less interested than all the others, “why not follow the practice of the Indians――if you like a story, believe it?” “I’m goin’ to,” exclaimed Frank. “I’m goin’ to believe it and I’m goin’ to believe Koos-ha-nax is up there in the mountains, somewhere――a man of real flesh and blood.” “And we’ll find him!” added Phil, “the man king of the Bighorns.” “I’d rather find old Husha,” put in Captain Ludington, smiling. “We could take his horns home and I don’t know what we could do with a decrepit old Indian. However,” he added, “in the language of Italy, ‘_si non e vero e bene travata_.’” “What’s that mean?” asked the boys together. “If it isn’t true it ought to be,” explained the Englishman. CHAPTER XI A MIDNIGHT INTRUDER When the boys turned out at seven o’clock in the morning they found Sam Skinner already on the observation platform, his black pipe glowing and his eyes busy with the landscape. “We just passed Calais,” said Sam, “where the old Sioux reservation used to begin. ’Tain’t like the old days though. They ain’t many of the old braves about now――too many clothes, store beef and wagons,” he explained. “But for about seventy-five miles――as far as Whately――ten years ago, you could a seen plenty o’ the old blanket boys hangin’ around these stations.” “Where are they?” asked Frank. “Most of ’em dead, I reckon,” answered Sam sucking on his pipe. “Them ’at ain’t have houses and some of ’em plows and wheat binders. But here’s some!” exclaimed the hunter springing suddenly to his feet. At that moment, through the cloud of dust following the swiftly moving train, could be seen moving along on a near-by road, a party of Indians. Two men, their blankets drawn closely around them, walked stoutly ahead of an unpainted wagon drawn by two ponies. In the wagon a squaw, her blanket about her hips, held the reins and, clinging to the sideboards and yelling as lustily at the passing train as white urchins, three children were jumping about excitedly in the wagon bed behind. Old Sam jerked his pipe from his mouth and, his hands to his face, emitted a cry that startled the boys. At the sound of it the two braves paused and then――as Sam repeated the call――with astounded looks they raised their right hands above their heads. “Injun for ‘howdy,’” explained Sam with a laugh as the train left the Indians far behind. “Where are they goin’, do you suppose?” asked Phil. “Huntin’?” “Probably to the nearest town to attend the ten-cent picture show,” said Sam. “Their huntin’ days are over. Them Injuns can buy beef.” It was Frank’s and Phil’s first sight of Indian land. “This is too flat and treeless for huntin’ along here, isn’t it?” was Frank’s next question. “The kind o’ huntin’ we do now ain’t the kind we used to do,” answered Sam recharging his pipe. “This is old buffalo ground and the best in the west in its day. My folks was English,” went on Skinner reminiscently, “and they came out to the Assinniboine River Valley in Canada when I was a baby. But from the time I was old enough to help in camp I can remember the buffalo hunts each fall. All them settlers――maybe several hundred――would trail for weeks to get down here near the Missouri River. But it wasn’t huntin’――it was the kind o’ work they do now in slaughter houses. We’d line up and march against them buffaloes like soldiers; and we had officers, too, to see that every one done his work. When the bugle blew, killin’ stopped for the day and all hands turned in to take care o’ the meat and the hides. And that went on sometimes for a month――the settlers followin’ the buffaloes till our wagons were full.” “Full of what?” asked Phil innocently. “My boy,” went on Sam, “them buffaloes was our winter’s provisions. Part of the meat was smoked or ‘jerked’ as we called it; the rest of it was ground up with the fat to make pemmican――that’s the way we used most of it――and the hides had to be cured. They was our profit, for even then we shipped ’em by the thousand to England. When the hunt was over we made the long march back to the Assinniboine. There’s buffalo yet,” he continued thoughtfully, “but not around here. Up on the Mackenzie River, nearer the Arctic Ocean than these prairies, there’s a few hundred animals that you might call buffaloes, but they ain’t the old prairie bull with a hump higher’n a man and wicked little eyes snappin’ out from a head hangin’ most on the ground. But,” continued Mr. Skinner, “buffaloes is buffaloes and I ain’t never goin’ to be satisfied till I’ve taken Mr. Mackworth up there on the Mackenzie. Huntin’ sheep with a spyglass may be sport all right but, for me, give me a good pony and the trail of a buffalo and I’ll be ready to quit.” And this was only a sample of Sam Skinner’s talk all day. At breakfast and later as the train passed out of the Fort Peck reservation, he reeled off tales of the wonders of the Bear Paw Mountains to the south; the Sweet Grass big game country to the north. Lord Pelton and Captain Ludington were as curious about this as the inexperienced boys. But, at seven o’clock that evening, hunting and Indian tales came to a temporary end; the train, as if approaching a stone wall, thundered up to Midvale――the town at the foot of the main range of the Rocky Mountains. There were no gradually ascending foothills. From the almost flat but flower-spotted grassy prairie――for the sage brush is almost unknown here――the dusty travelers were whirled like the flash of a moving picture into the wonders of the mountain world. Midvale marks the southern boundary of the Glacier National Park――the old Lewis and Clark reservation that extends into the heart of the mountains, and 135 miles north to the Canadian boundary. There was no thought of dinner. From seven o’clock until darkness finally blotted out the view of peak and range; of chasm and precipice; of matted and tangled forest; mountain streams and veil-like falls, the entire party sat on the observation platform. It was “Ah” and “Oh,” “Here, quick,” and “Look there,” until necks were stiff and eyes ached. “Wonderful!” exclaimed Captain Ludington. “Them trees?” queried Sam Skinner. “You bet they are; all o’ that. You couldn’t make five mile a day in ’em. And we got a good deal o’ that down timber in the Elk River Valley. It’s easier to look at than to cut a trail through.” Then came dinner after one of the longest and fullest days the boys had ever known. The branch line, on which the Teton was to be hauled to Michel and across the Canadian border into Canada, left the main line at Rexford――well up in the mountains. The limited was due there at a little after midnight. There the special car would be sidetracked to await the leaving of the branch road train at four o’clock the next day. Mr. Mackworth suggested that every one turn in as there would be plenty of time later for sight-seeing. But the boys, visiting the rear platform after the evening meal, were so entranced with the scene that they hastened to summon the others of the party. The laboring train had crawled well up into the ruggeder mountain heights. And now, on a higher level, it was whirling along on the shoulder of the mountains; swinging around great cliffs on a roadbed cut in their face; now and then shooting through a tunnel or over a spidery trestle, and then getting new impetus on a tangent following the bed of some foaming stream. The moon had risen and all the world in sight was either the black of the chasms or the silvery glisten of moonlit pines. But what interested Frank and Phil was not so much this glory of nature’s panorama as the song of the train as it sped in and out of narrow places; panted under new grades or breathed full and deep under restful downward grades, and then vied with the echo of its own engine noises as they were caught up and hurled back by unseen precipices. “There,” exclaimed Frank, grasping Captain Ludington’s arm, “you can tell we’re goin’ up again even when you can’t see anything. Listen!” “Chuc-a-chung, chuc-a-chung-chuc-a-chung,” rolled back from the engine. Then the “chuc-a-chung” stopped for an instant, only to be heard off to the left as if miles away. “That means,” explained Frank, “we’re rounding a curve and gettin’ the echo. It’s just as if the engine were talkin’. There, we’re behind the engine again,” cried the enthusiastic boy as the “chuc-a-chung” rang out again. The dust of the prairie had now disappeared and as Nelse had swept and wiped up the platform, the sleepiest of the delighted travelers could not resist lingering to enjoy the mountain ride. The June-time heat of the plains had also changed to a cool night breeze that suggested sweaters. When, at last, a new and faster “chuc-a-chuck” of the big mountain engine told of the rapidly increasing grades, and a sudden curve of the train brought into view a distant summit glistening silvery white in the moonlight, Mr. Mackworth exclaimed: “There it is, gentlemen! That’s the snow that we’ll have in sight for three weeks. Having saluted it, let’s go to bed.” All arose, but Sam Skinner seemed a bit embarrassed. “Colonel,” he said at last, addressing Mr. Mackworth, “you know I ain’t much for these sleepin’ cars. I slept on a shelf last night. If you don’t mind I’d like to draw these curtains and bring my blankets out here to-night.” “Why there’s a couch in the dining room, Sam,” replied Mr. Mackworth, smiling. “Try that.” “’Tain’t that, Colonel, exactly. But this air tastes good to me after four years down Winnipeg way. And you know I like to light a pipe now and then when I turn over.” “We’ll stay with you,” exclaimed Phil at once. “You’ll go to bed,” ordered Mr. Mackworth, “there’s plenty of outdoor sleepin’ coming to you boys.” Retiring to their stateroom, the two boys sat for some time observing the beauties of the night scenery through the screens of the window. “We’ll be at Rexford in an hour,” Frank urged, “and I want to be up and see the limited cut us off and leave us. I like to see what’s doin’ when we get to places.” “By rights,” added Phil, “we ought to be awake and walk up to the engine and give old Bill――all engineers are named Bill so far as I’ve read――and give ‘Old Bill’ $20.” “You’re right,” exclaimed Frank. “That’s regulations. We’ll take one of your $20 bills.” Phil, carried away by the new idea, examined his dwindling roll of money, picked out a clean bill and put it in his vest pocket. Then, for an hour’s sleep, the boys threw themselves on their bunks. Sometime later Frank roused himself, lay for a few moments as if trying to figure out where he was and then sprang up excitedly. All was quiet. The Teton stood as still as a rock. Snapping on the light the lad glanced at his watch. Then he caught Phil by the shoulder. “Hey there, wake up!” he called in a low voice. As Phil opened his eyes Frank added: “You’ve saved that $20. It’s now two o’clock and ‘Old Bill’ has left us.” “Huh?” grunted Phil. “Get up,” whispered Frank. “We’re at Rexford. Let’s get out and have a look at things.” “Not me,” drawled Phil. “Everything will be there in the morning.” In another moment he was asleep again. “All right,” thought Frank, “maybe I won’t ever be in a mountain town again at two o’clock on a June mornin’ with the moon shinin’ all over everything. So here goes for a little sight-seein’ of my own.” Reaching the observation platform Frank found Sam Skinner apparently asleep. But the boy had no sooner touched the drawn curtains than the hunter spoke. “I’m just goin’ out to look about,” explained Frank. Without comment Sam threw off his blankets, filled his pipe and followed the boy to the ground. “Was you awake when we got here?” asked Frank. “Yes,” answered Sam, “Mr. Mackworth was up. I got out with him. He saw the conductor. And say,” added Sam, “he went up to the engine and gave the engineer some money. He’s always generous with folks he likes.” Frank was thinking hard. At last he said to himself: “Well, anyway, it wasn’t any business of mine. It would have been foolish for us to have done it. I’m glad we didn’t wake up.” The moon, now behind a mountain range, left Rexford buried in the shadows of the valley. There was not a light in sight except a feeble glow in the near-by station and a few switch signals. Frank could form no estimate of the size of the place, and as the gloom was not inviting and the air was frostlike and snappy the boy gave up his plan for a night excursion. He had just suggested a return to Sam when the old hunter caught him by the arm, made a motion signifying silence and then disappeared around the end of the car. Frank kept at his heels. At first there was nothing to be seen or heard and then the boy, catching his breath, pointed to the forward end of the car where a faint glow seemed to come from the side door of the baggage compartment. The boy darted forward ahead of Skinner. A glance showed one section of the double doors shoved back and a light in the car. On the ground beneath the door was an empty box. As Frank came opposite the open door and caught sight of the interior of the car his heart leaped. Crouched over an object of some kind was a man on his knees. By his side was a spluttering candle. Surrounding the intruder on all sides were dozens of cans of gasoline. The knowledge that at any instant the Teton might be blown to pieces was the only thought in the boy’s mind. There was no time to think of the peril of encountering the intruder unarmed. “Put that light out!” yelled Frank. “Put it out. You’ll blow up the car,” he shouted as he leaped on the box beneath the door. Instantly the light went out; there was a rush in the car and then the boy, already half through the door, was thrust backwards as if by a kick, and a form hurled itself over his head. The intruder and Frank rolled down the slight embankment almost together and both against Sam Skinner. “Stop!” yelled Sam as the man scrambled to his feet and stumbled away in the darkness. But the intruder did not stop and, with one quick look to make sure that it was Frank at his feet, Sam’s revolver spit a streak of fire toward the fugitive. Without waiting to ask questions the old hunter, his fighting blood aroused, disappeared after the man. Frank, now alarmed for the first time over the chance he had taken, got to his feet. As he did so he felt an ache in his shoulder. It was not enough to stop him, however, and he sprang on to the box again and into the dark compartment of the car. There were roof electric lights in the car with a switch at the rear door. Stumbling toward it, the boy finally turned on the lights. A glance showed that a thief had been at work. “And we got him just in time,” chuckled Frank to himself. Standing by the open door were all the gun cases of the party. In the middle of the car was Mr. Mackworth’s English sole leather gun trunk. A sharp knife had been passed completely around the top and still stuck in the cut leather, which in another moment could have been lifted out like a loose panel. The car door had been pried open with a railroad spike bar. Frank had hardly made this examination before there was a knock at the compartment door and a call to open it. It was Mr. Mackworth, breathless. Frank stuttered out the facts. Almost before he had finished, his uncle in slippers and pajamas was out of the door and off in the darkness in the direction Sam and the fugitive had taken. The door lock was broken but, pulling the section in place, Frank turned off the lights, hurried back through the car and――without arousing its other occupants――started after the would-be thief and his pursuers. CHAPTER XII THE END OF THE RAILROAD Frank found Mr. Mackworth and Sam Skinner at the dimly lit depot in consultation with the night telegraph operator. Rexford being a town of a thousand or more inhabitants and a railroad junction point with many switch tracks, freight cars and railway buildings, the escape of the thief was not difficult. As the sloping sides of the mountains reached down to the town on two sides, there were avenues for successful flight over the rough and dark trails. Therefore, further pursuit was abandoned. “Anyway,” remarked Mr. Mackworth, “we haven’t lost anything. And if we could catch the man we wouldn’t care to stay to prosecute him.” “Why, what’s the matter, Frank?” he exclaimed as he caught sight of the boy’s pale face and saw him tremble. “I guess it’s where he kicked me,” explained Frank trying to make light of his injury. Instantly Mr. Mackworth had Frank’s coat and shirt off. On his chest near the left shoulder was a dull red mark, something like a shoe heel in shape and rapidly turning black. “Why didn’t you tell me of this?” exclaimed Frank’s uncle with concern. “Does it hurt you?” “Not much,” answered the boy, “except when I touch it.” Sam Skinner pushed Mr. Mackworth aside and began an examination of the bruise with all the practical skill of an outdoor surgeon. As he ran his hands over the boy’s chest Frank winced and turned paler. “No bones broken,” reported Sam confidently, as he pressed on Frank’s collar bone and shoulder joint while the boy gritted his teeth. “Cough!” ordered Sam. Frank did so, Sam holding his ear to the boy’s chest. “Spit!” ordered Sam. Frank laughed and complied as well as he could. Sam nodded his head. “Only a bruise,” he explained. “Nothin’ hurt inside. A little liniment and he’ll be all right in a day or two.” “I certainly hope so,” said Mr. Mackworth as he helped Frank to get into his shirt again. “I wouldn’t have you hurt, my boy, for all that’s in the Teton. You certainly saved our shooting outfits and, like as not, our lives as well. We’ve got both to thank you for.” “There wasn’t anything else to do,” replied Frank. “And say,” he added, “I reckon there ain’t any need to say anything about this is there? I don’t want any hero business.” “You’ll have to leave that to me,” responded his uncle as they made their way back to the car. Frank got out the medicine kit his mother had given him and Sam rubbed him with liniment. At three o’clock, Frank crawled into his berth again. Lying still his bruise did not pain him, but when Phil awoke him about seven o’clock the boy’s shoulder was black and blue, and his arm was stiff. The town by daylight was far from being as interesting as the boys had hoped. The altitude was not great――not more than 4,000 feet――but the distant view both east and west revealed mountain ranges, snow crowned in places. North of the town and in a lower valley the Kootenai River wound a bending course. Along this the party was now to make its way into Canada. Frank had not figured on the need of an explanation to account for Mr. Mackworth’s ruined trunk and, therefore, the adventure of the boy and Sam Skinner was fully known before breakfast. Then the excitement began all over again. The Englishmen made the lad a hero in spite of himself. It was doubtful if one man could have carried away any considerable amount of the plunder that had been heaped up near the door of the car. But each of Mr. Mackworth’s guests had a most elaborate and expensive shooting outfit, and each seemed convinced that Frank had saved his own particular property. As Frank was a member of the party, the tactful Captain Ludington and Lord Pelton recognized that they could not express their gratitude in money. For that reason their verbal thanks were genuinely profuse. “I don’t know why you select me for all this fine talk,” Frank said at last. “Mr. Skinner heard the man. He did more than I did――” “All right,” exclaimed Mr. Mackworth. “We’ll have a special luncheon to-day in honor of both.” When this event came off it turned out to be a tribute to a third person――Jake Green. Instead of a luncheon it was a banquet and a jolly one. As Frank approached his chair he found by its side――leaning against the table――a Lefever, sixteen gauge, hammerless shotgun, automatic ejector, Damascus steel barrels, English walnut stock and pistol grip. At his plate was a card inscribed: “For value received,” and signed by all the members of the party, including Phil, whose shotgun had not been overlooked by the intruder. “I won’t take it,” began Frank, red of face and embarrassed. “Give it to Mr. Skinner.” “O, I’ve got mine,” exclaimed Sam pointing to several folded bills on his plate. “Better keep it. You’ll need it for grouse up on the Elk.” Not knowing what else to do Frank sat down in confusion and thus came into possession of the gun, which is yet one of his most prized belongings. As soon as the attention of their friends had been withdrawn Phil leaned over to his chum and whispered: “I never did have any use for a sleepyhead. This is an awful warning to me.” From Rexford to Michel――the mountain town in Canada at the southern end of Elk Valley where the Teton was to stop, and from which place Mr. Mackworth and his friends were to enter the goat and sheep country by wagon, horse and airship――was about eighty-five miles. The branch road was a mining line and when, just after four o’clock in the afternoon, the special car was attached to the daily “mixed train,” it was with no great assurance that the hunting party heard the creaking and felt the swaying of the big car on the lighter tracks. The ride northward gradually lifted the train higher and higher. The road followed the Kootenai’s east bank and, having left the less abrupt region of Rexford behind them, the travelers soon had a panorama rivaling that of the evening before. Immediately east lay the Mission Mountains――the western boundary of the new National Glacier Park――and slowly the laboring engine drew the train on to its higher pine covered flanks. The Kootenai dropped below. Undimmed by the shadows of night; clear and distinct beneath the sapphire sky the whole world stood out until there seemed no distance. There was not the speed of the transcontinental limited and the train was a half hour in covering ten miles. This brought it to Gateway――the boundary between the United States and Canada. “The white mark over there on the station platform,” explained Mr. Mackworth as the train came to a stop, “marks the boundary between the two countries.” Of course the boys had to alight and straddle the line. “This is an event to me,” exclaimed Frank, “for it’s the first time I’ve ever been out of the United States.” “Me, too,” said Phil, who was yet standing in his own country. “And that being true I think I’ll go abroad.” With a laugh he jumped across the line. “But,” he added, “the United States is good enough for me. I don’t see much difference. I think I’ll come home,” and he sprang back again. At seven o’clock the train reached Fernie, a soft coal town and a fitting-out post for hunters in this part of Canada. But there was no time for shopping――much to Phil’s regret――for the $20 he had not given “Old Bill” was looked upon as that much saved. A few minutes before eight o’clock the Teton finished its outward journey at the end of the railway in the little village of Michel. So long as the train was in motion, revealing new vistas of grand and picturesque scenery, the passengers in the Teton would not leave the observation platform for supper. But, as it came to a stop in a narrow and deep valley through which a cool wind was already drifting and where, cast by the sunlit painted ranges, deep shadows were already on the little hamlet, Jake’s dinner at last received its merited attention. At Fernie the station agent had handed Mr. Mackworth a packet. As the party had now reached the end of the long journey this first meal in the cool, dark snowbound mountain valley was the liveliest of the trip. Formality was put aside and, with the knowledge that the next morning would see the first of their plans under way, all talked at once. In the midst of this Mr. Mackworth produced his packet, opened it and handed each one at the table――except Sam Skinner――a small but formidable looking bit of paper. “Now be happy, all of you,” he exclaimed. “Here’s a hunting license for each. With it in your possession you may legally kill and take out of the country five mountain goats. Let one of ’em be Neena and may they all be Billies and big ones. You may also slay three mountain sheep one of which, of course, will be Husha the Black Ram. Incidentally you may capture all the grizzlies you see――if you can. Let us hope for one twelve-foot skin at least. Of deer, shoot no more than six each. The law don’t specify it, but we’ll take none but bucks. And remember, don’t shoot a moose till you land a whopper, for one is all you are allowed. As for elk,” concluded Mr. Mackworth, raising his hand in warning, “none at all.” “Sam,” whispered Frank aside to the hunter, “what are these licenses worth?” “They ain’t worth much to most hunters,” answered Sam soberly, “but they cost $50 each.” “That’s $250,” exclaimed Frank taking a new glance at his license, “and you haven’t one. What’ll you do?” “O, I ain’t lookin’ for hides nor horns,” answered Sam. “If I shoot anything it’ll be food.” Michel, although a town of but a few hundred inhabitants, was a mile and a quarter long. It stretched along the winding bottom of the valley as a single street, the mountain slopes on each side rising so quickly as to make a second street impossible. And as all the houses were small and nearly all painted dark red, the new arrivals had not seen much of the village in the fast gathering night. But the single street pointed toward the jack-pine valley to the north through which lies the road to the unsettled wilderness beyond――one of the great game preserves of America――the Elk River Valley where as yet the pot hunter is unknown. “We’ll take things easy this evening,” said Mr. Mackworth when the excitement over the hunting licenses had subsided, “and to-morrow we’ll leisurely perfect our plans. I suppose the first thing will be to find a suitable ground for assembling the airship.” “And that don’t look any too easy,” broke in Frank. “This is the narrowest town I’ve ever seen.” “Then,” continued Mr. Mackworth, “we’ve got to inventory our stuff. You can never be sure you have what you’re going to need. What we’ve missed we’ll have to go back to Fernie and buy.” “First job for the _Loon_,” exclaimed Phil. “That’ll be pie. It’s only twenty-three miles away.” “Not improbable,” went on their host, “since we have only one train a day. We’ll be in Michel all day to-morrow. Early the next morning all our provisions and camping paraphernalia will go by wagons to the only ranch in the valley――Charley Smith’s place up near Sulphur Springs――twenty-five miles distant. We’ll follow on horses.” “On horses?” cried out Frank. “Here’s two of us who won’t be on horses. Phil and I’ll be in the _Loon_ and two more may as well be with us. We can take Captain Ludington and Lord Pelton. Why not?” “But we’ve got to have horses. We can’t count on your airship for everything.” “That’s where you’re mistaken,” added Frank. “You can count on it everywhere and at all times. We’ll take you all anywhere you want to go. And when there are too many we’ll make double trips.” “We’ll take horses for all,” insisted Mr. Mackworth. “They’re cheap. Then if your aëroplane slips a cog we won’t have to walk home. We’ll reach Smith’s ranch in the late afternoon. I suggest you wait here until four or five o’clock with your flyin’ machine, and then I suppose you can overtake us in an hour.” “In thirty minutes,” said Phil proudly. “So be it,” said Mr. Mackworth. “When we are all in camp near Smith’s place we are going to stop two or three days to get acclimated. We’ll also cross the ridge there and have a day’s sport at Josephine Falls on the Fording, where I hope we’ll get enough trout to give Jake a chance to give us a ‘balsam bake.’” “It’ll be my first trout,” interrupted Lord Pelton. “But not your last, I’ll bet,” went on Mr. Mackworth. “While we are enjoying ourselves our guides will be sorting over our outfit for the pack horses. The wagons will stop here. When we leave Smith’s we’ll leave trails and civilization behind. We’ll make our way into the real mountains by way of Goat Creek, and then in the Herchmer Range, Bird Mountain and Goat Pass we ought to find our sport. We’ll always camp in the timber and where the horses can climb. But we’ll hunt on foot.” Captain Ludington smacked his lips and lit a fresh cigar. “That sounds awfully good to me,” he chuckled. At that moment Jake announced that Mr. Hosmer was outside. “It’s one of our guides and teamsters,” explained Mr. Mackworth, “Cal Hosmer, who was to report to me this evening. If the history of the Elk River Valley is ever written Cal’s experiences will have to appear on every page. If any of you want grizzlies, stick to Hosmer; he’s the greatest bear hunter in Western Canada.” CHAPTER XIII HUSHA THE BLACK RAM Cal or “Grizzly” Hosmer was brought into the car, introduced and persuaded to eat some dinner. He knew Mr. Mackworth and Sam Skinner and he and his friends held a reunion. Then the talk passed to the plans for the next day. When these had been discussed the bear hunter arose to take his leave. Followed to the rear platform by Sam Skinner and the boys, a final pipe was proposed by Skinner and the two old hunters took possession of a couple of chairs. It was decidedly cool for the boys but, anxious to miss no possible bit of hunting or mountain lore, they hurried to their stateroom, donned their new cloth Jersey jackets and, returning, perched themselves on the rail near the men. The moon was just appearing above the Eastern range. “So you youngsters air agoin’ huntin’ fur sheep an’ goats in a airyplane?” began Hosmer at once. “Yes, sir,” replied Frank. “What do you think about it?” “Think about it?” repeated the bear hunter sucking hard on his pipe. “What license hev I got to think about it? I ain’t never seen one o’ ’em, nor never had no notion I would.” “Well,” explained Frank, “we can go wherever we like in it――high or low――and stay in the air practically as long as we like.” “That ought to help some,” said Hosmer, “fur there is sure many a place them critters’ll go whar they ain’t no man kin foller ’em.” “That’s it,” exclaimed Phil. “Do you know any such places?” “Do I know any such places?” laughed Hosmer. “Say, Sam,” chuckled Grizzly, “do we know any places whar a goat kin go that a man can’t foller ’em?” “Well, some,” answered Skinner also laughing. “An’ comin’ down to tacks,” added Sam, “I reckon there’s a sight more such places than where you can go.” “Show us the hardest,” exclaimed Frank. “That’s all we want to know.” Hosmer, who had been relighting his pipe stopped suddenly as if struck with an idea. His chuckle died out and his face became serious. “There ain’t no grizzly in the Selkirk country ’at kin go whar I can’t foller him, and hev,” he explained. “But as fur sheep an’ goats, let ’em git the wind o’ ye an’, mainly, it’s all off. They’re the tantalizinest critters ’at ever growed in these parts. But if that airyplane kin fly anywhere, I almost wisht――” “You wish what?” asked Phil sliding from his seat on the railing. “I almost wisht I had the nerve to go in it and hev jist one look down on Baldy’s Bench from the sky.” “Baldy’s Bench?” exclaimed Frank. “What’s that and where?” “How’d that be, Skinner?” went on Hosmer, turning to Sam. “Baldy’s Bench?” repeated Sam. “I’ve heard of a lot of goat and sheep benches, but I don’t know as I ever heard of that one.” “Well,” went on Hosmer, “I calc’late mebbe that’s so. ’Tain’t very handy and ’tain’t hunted much. Cause why? Cause ever’ one knows ’tain’t no use. But onless I’m mistook, allowin’ that there’s kings o’ animals, ef the king o’ all the sheep in these Rockies don’t live up on Baldy’s Bench, I miss my guess.” “What makes you think so?” asked Frank excitedly. “What makes me think so? Well, for one thing,” replied Hosmer, “I’ve seen him.” “Oh,” interrupted Skinner arousing himself. “You mean Old Indian Chief? I remember now.” “Sure, some calls him that,” answered the bear hunter. “But ef ye ever laid eyes on him he’ll always be Ol’ Baldy to ye. I reckon he’s the biggest an’ oldest Bighorn in the world. I know he’s the curiousest critter ’at ever clumb a precipice.” “Maybe it’s Husha the Black Ram!” exclaimed Frank as he caught Phil’s arm. “Ye must ’a’ heerd that from some Kootenai Injun,” said Hosmer at once. “That’s one o’ their pet names fur any Bighorn they can’t git.” “Ever hear of Koos-ha-nax, the mighty Indian hunter who set out to kill the king of all the mountain sheep?” continued Frank breathlessly. “Sure,” answered Hosmer, “an’ in twenty yarns more or less. Ye mean about Koos bein’ kind of a brother to the ol’ ram?” “That’s it,” said Phil drawing nearer the speaker. “Did you ever see him?” Hosmer laughed, struck his old friend Sam on the knee and then subsiding, slowly relit his bubbling pipe. “I kin see that someone has been a stringin’ you lads. But ’tain’t surprisin’. All Injuns kind o’ sing that story. But ye kin take it from me――’tain’t no man a livin’, white ur red, ’at could ever ’a’ clumb whar I’ve seen Ol’ Baldy go. There ain’t nothin’ to the Injun part o’ that yarn.” “But you do think there may be a king of the sheep?” asked Frank. “Like as not. An’ I reckon they is o’ the elks an’ moose, too.” “And Old Baldy may be the king of the mountain sheep?” “Why not? He sure looks the part――ur did. Like as not he’s dead now. I ain’t been near the bench in――mebbe seven ur eight year.” “Looks the part! What do you mean by that?” eagerly inquired Phil. “Sam,” said Hosmer, “gimme a pipe o’ that smokin’ o’ yourn――it smells like reg’lar tobacco. I see I got to tell these boys about Baldy.” As he emptied his odorous pipe and refilled it with some of Sam’s tobacco――which, by the way, came from Mr. Mackworth’s private stock――the two boys sank on the floor at Grizzly’s feet. “They ain’t agoin’ to be no start to it like a book story,” began Hosmer between puffs, “because they wasn’t no special beginnin’ to what I seen Ol’ Baldy do to a couple o’ lions――us only seein’ the end o’ it. So long as ye don’t know the lay o’ the land, it’s hard to tell ye whar the Bench is. Mr. Mackworth ain’t never been to it an’ he’s hunted ’bout as fur as the next one ’round here. Most gin’rally we all work up the Elk River Valley, huntin’ the hills right an’ left along the river till we git to the Fordin’ an’ then foller up that stream ur Goat Crick to head waters. Well, ef ye take Goat Crick trail to Norboe Mountain, an’ that’s better’n sixty mile from here, an’ then turn north ye kin git to the Bench by goin’ about forty mile furder north. An’ it’s some goin’ I’ll promise ye,” continued Hosmer. “That’s why we customary turned south at Norboe an’ worked the Herchmer’s.” “Pretty high mountains, eh?” asked Frank. “Not so high in the way o’ peaks, but gin’rally high,” went on the hunter inhaling the fragrance of his new tobacco like a perfume and contentedly crossing his legs, one of which he swung back and forth placidly. “It’s all good game country but a lot o’ folks don’t know it. The only deestrict ’at’s at all like the Bench ’at I know of is Old Crow’s Nest Mountain whar the C. P. cuts through the Rockies over on the divide. It stands out on a knob o’ ground that’s kivered with lodge pole pines. Them jack trees, seein’ ’em from a good ways off, reaches out like a blanket. An’ the Bench is punched right up through the middle o’ the blanket like a big choc’late drop, bare an’ brown. When the snow’s on it, it’s a picter. Raisin’ above them green jack pines, it’s so glarin’ white ye’d think it wuz sugar, but it ain’t; ain’t nothing sweet about it either in the way o’ bus’ness sich as mine. Ye’d think, lookin’ at the Bench over them long rollin’ stretches o’ green pine from the next range, that ye could walk up one side o’ it an’ down the other like them Egyptian pyrimids, bein’ nothin’ but big handy steps. Sich they air, but not fur men when ye come up to ’em; them steps is fifty an’ a hundred feet high. An’ they’s landin’s back o’ each o’ ’em. But how air ye goin’ to git on ’em? They is sheep trails up some o’ ’em but in most places not even them. They is places on the bench ’at the sheep jist nacherly walks up the walls an’ I seen ’em do it. Ye can’t foller ’em,” asserted Hosmer, “an’ ye don’t need to try. Therefore and hence,” he continued authoritatively, “ye kin rest assured they is a plenty o’ sheep thar, ur was, eight year ago.” The boys were brimming with happiness. Nothing could be better suited to their desires. “I suppose you call it the Bench because of those steps?” suggested Phil. “The sheep live on these steps I suppose, movin’ around the mountain to keep in the sun.” “I call it the Bench,” continued Hosmer, “because it is――the top bein’ flattened off as I calc’late. It kind o’ looks like a dome an’ purty nigh a peak from the foot o’ the mountain. But ef ye see it fur enough off on a clear day, ye’ll see the top is a big bench slopin’ toward the east, as I reckon, ’though they ain’t no range over east whar ye kin git a look at it. My own idee is that there’s a sort o’ flat summit there or mebbe a sort o’ purtected basin whar the real climbers o’ them sheep go. Leastwise they don’t hang around much on the steps.” “Couldn’t a man get up there if he was a good climber?” asked Phil, who had Koos-ha-nax and Old Indian Chief in mind. “Fur be it from me to say positive what any man kin do ur can’t. There may be places whar a man could git his toes in here and there but I ain’t never found ’em.” “But there might have been a trail years ago that a man could use, even if it’s gone now?” persisted Phil. “Considerin’ what the snow an’ ice does to the rocks, that’s strickly possible,” conceded “Grizzly.” “But, if I ever seen a mountain ’at you’d say was nonassessible I reckon it’s the Bench.” “But Old Baldy,” exclaimed Frank, “tell us about him.” “I ain’t seen Baldy but once,” went on the talker, “but I’d heerd o’ him often from the Kootenai Injuns. They didn’t make no doubt about him bein’ the king o’ the Bighorns an’ I kind o’ agreed with ’em when I seen him. The biggest ram I ever killed stood 41 inches high an’ weighed 320 pounds. Ef Ol’ Baldy don’t weigh 500 pounds and stan’, horns to hoofs, near five feet, I’m mistook bad.” “But why is he called Baldy?” Phil asked quickly. “Because he is,” replied Hosmer, “is, ur wuz, fur like enough he’s dead now. Baldy is, ur wuz, the Black Ram all right; his horns when I seen him wuz black as new coal――and big! I’ll never swear ’at I could span ’em with my two arms. Sheep as a rule is sort o’ brown-black lookin’; one ur the other as depends. I reckon Baldy had been reg’lar black but bein’ mighty old accordin’ to the rings on his horns he wuz gray like mostly all over, makin’ him look sort o’ ghost like. That is exceptin’ his head where he wuz plum’ bald. From his horns to his muzzle he hadn’t a speck o’ hair an’ the skin o’ his face, though it wuz flabby and wrinkled, wuz kind o’ pinkish-cream like. That, him bein’ gray all over, wouldn’t ’a’ looked so unusual like ef it hadn’t ’a’ been fur two black marks on his face. I couldn’t never figger out whether it wuz hair still a growin’ there ur disfiggerments o’ the skin. But the ol’ ram, an’ I never made no doubt but it was him the Kootenais call Husha, has a mark ye’ll know if ye ever see him. From the crown o’ his horns to his muzzle they is a black stripe jist like a streak o’ paint an’ as reg’lar. Acrost from eye to eye is another stripe and them two makes a black cross; ’at’s the first thing I saw――a black cross on his ol’ pinkish, wrinkled face.” “And?” exclaimed Frank eagerly as Hosmer fondled his pipe a moment. “Well,” resumed the story-teller, “to git to facks, I wuz lion huntin’ one winter with Jack Jaffray, havin’ a camp up back o’ Mt. Osborne. We wuz workin’ on snowshoes an’ had been out o’ camp about twenty-four hours down near Baldy’s Bench, the weather bein’ fine an’ the snow hard. We had a notion about lions gittin’ out o’ the timber on to the sheep trails fur food and the Bench seemed a likely place. This wuz in April an’ they had been enough sun to start some o’ the snow up on the Bench over on the east side. They wuz great clean patches o’ rock whar the steps had been swept clean by slides. “That meant the sheep trails might be clear in the sunniest part o’ the east side. It was purty hard walkin’ in the timber so we got clost as we could to the Bench an’ crawlin’ over the snow kivered rocks worked around to east’ard. It wasn’t long before we come acrost lion signs an’ fresh ones, too. Out o’ the timber them lions had come, fur they wuz two, jist ahead of us an’ on the same bus’ness. That looked good fur we had the wind o’ ’em――” “You mean mountain lions?” asked Frank edging still nearer. “What’d you think? African?” retorted Hosmer. “But, no jokin’, don’t think Rocky Mountain lions is pet Malteses. We knowed this all right. So we kept our eyes open. Fin’ly we got up to the Bench and findin’ footin’ we took off our snowshoes an’ crawled up on the first ledge ur step. We could see the lions had jist done the same thing. We wuz trailin’ single file, me in front, an’ at the first bend I come on a picter ’at’ll be hard to furgit. The point o’ the next shelf above us had broke off, likely by snow ur ice, and they wuz a slice gone out o’ the face o’ the Bench. It made a precipice above us not less ’an fifty feet high an’ the slice fallin’ out made a kind o’ plateau mebbe two hundred feet long endin’ in a wall at the other end. “Close to the wall wuz two as fine painters as I ever seen. We measured ’em later on――one o’ ’em nine feet from tip to tip. They wuz crouched fur business all right, their long yellow winter hair on end an’ their bellies on the rocks. Side by side, their long heavy tails beatin’ the rocks, they wuz weavin’ for’ard like snakes. An’ at the fur end o’ the plateau wuz what they wuz lookin’ fur――a herd o’ about twenty sheep a lyin’ in the sun. “The sheep must hev got there over the trail we wuz wishes your report forthwith on board the ship." "Mr. Transit, Mr. Pillgrim is under arrest. You will permit no one to communicate with him except the surgeon." "Under arrest!" exclaimed Mr. Transit. "I have no time to explain," replied Somers, as he directed his coxswain to pipe down his boat's crew. When the second cutter was hauled up to the accommodation ladder, Somers stepped on board, and a few moments later, touched his hat to the first lieutenant on the quarter deck of the Chatauqua. "I have to report that I have captured the Ben Nevis," said Somers. "Where is Mr. Pillgrim?" asked Mr. Hackleford, the captain standing by, an interested and excited listener. "He is wounded, and under arrest, sir." "How wounded?" "He fired at me, and in self-defence I was obliged to shoot him. I think he is not seriously wounded. He boarded the Ben Nevis, and had given the captain of her permission to proceed, though the vessel was headed towards Cape Fear." "You have done well, Mr. Somers," said Captain Cascabel. "Beat to quarters, Mr. Hackleford." When the crew were at quarters, Mr. Hackleford explained to them what had occurred, and fully justified the course of the fourth lieutenant; whereupon an earnest and enthusiastic cheer rang through the ship. "Are you satisfied, Tom?" asked Somers of the boatswain. "Bless ye! I was satisfied before, Mr. Somers. There is only one dark thing in the whole of it." "What's that, Tom?" "If Captain Cascabel and Mr. Hackleford both knew that Mr. Pillgrim was a traitor, why did they send him out to capture that steamer? That's what I can't see through." "Can't you? Well, if they had not sent him, we should not have captured the Ben Nevis." "I don't see why." "Don't you? Well, you are not as sharp as you are sometimes." "I know I'm dull, Mr. Somers, but splinter my figger head if I can see through it." "The Ben Nevis is good for fifteen knots at least." "I know that; she did it while we were coming up." "The Chatauqua can't make more than twelve." "That's true." "Then, of course, the Chatauqua could not catch the Ben Nevis." "That's clear enough. But we were out in the boats, and were close aboard of her." "And just then she sheered off. Could the boats have overhauled her?" "Sartinly not; but you could have put a shot through her hull." "Which might, at that distance, have disabled her, and might not. The chances were all against us. But the moment Mr. Pillgrim hailed her, and swung his cap, she stopped her wheels. They knew very well he would not detain her." "I see now." "Probably the captain of the Ben Nevis knew the Chatauqua, and knew that Pillgrim was on board of her, and they were on the lookout for him. If any other officer than myself had been in the second cutter, I am satisfied Mr. Pillgrim would not have returned to his boat, but would have staid on board the Ben Nevis." "He's a horrible villain--arn't he?" said the honest boatswain. This conversation took place while Captain Cascabel was preparing his despatches to be sent by the prize steamer to the navy department. When they were completed, Somers was sent for, and he repaired at once to the captain's cabin. "Mr. Somers, though I can hardly spare you, I feel compelled to send you home as prize master in the Ben Nevis. I have commended you to the department," said Captain Cascabel, as he handed him the despatches. "Thank you, sir." A prize crew was at once detailed, with two master's mates to act as first and second officers, and a corporal and three marines to guard the prisoner who was to be sent back in the prize. Somers bade a hasty good by to his brother officers, and with his crew was sent on board the Ben Nevis, whose deck he was now to tread for a brief period as her commander. His orders required him to take the Ben Nevis to Fortress Monroe, and there communicate with the navy department. "Well, doctor, how is your patient?" asked Somers, when he reached the deck of the prize. "He will do very well. If you had put the bullet half an inch nearer his brain, you would have finished him. The skin is torn off the side of his head, and I suppose the ball stunned him. He is sitting up now, and appears to be as well as ever, though in no very amiable frame of mind." "I suppose not." "He says you are a rebel and a traitor, and he intends to prove it. I told him I thought his wound had affected his brain." "It would require a long story to explain what he means. Mr. Hackleford has the papers, and I doubt not he will tell you all about it, doctor," replied Somers, as he proceeded to arrange for the return voyage. All who were not going home in the Ben Nevis were sent back to the Chatauqua. The firemen and engineers of the prize steamer were willing to discharge their duties as before, and under the direction of one of the second assistants from the ship, they were set at work. The first and third cutters pulled away towards the man-of-war, giving three rousing cheers as they departed, and the Ben Nevis steamed away to the northward. By this time it was ten o'clock at night. The watch was set on deck, and Somers went below to obtain his supper, for he felt the need of some rest and refreshment. The steward, anxious to be on good terms with the new commander, had provided the best meal the larder of the Ben Nevis afforded, and Somers was hungry enough to do it ample justice. A marine, with cutlass and revolver, stood at the door of Pillgrim's state-room. When Somers had finished his supper, and was about to go on deck, the sentinel informed him that the prisoner had knocked several times on his door. "See what he wants." The marine opened the door. "Who is the prize master?" asked Pillgrim. The sentinel looked at Somers for permission before he replied. "Answer him." "Mr. Somers," answered the marine. "Will you present my compliments to Mr. Somers, and say that I beg the favor of an interview with him?" Again the sentinel glanced at Somers. "With pleasure," replied the prize master, as politely as the request was made. "Ah, Mr. Somers," said the traitor, as the new commander of the Ben Nevis stepped forward and showed himself to the prisoner, "I am happy to see you." "Are you, indeed?" added Somers, rather amused at the smooth tones of the traitor. "I am, I assure you. Might I beg the favor of a few moments' private conversation with you?" "Certainly; have you any weapons about you?" "None, whatever." Somers directed the marine to seat himself at the farther end of the cabin. "Thank you, Mr. Somers; you are as kind and generous as ever." "Let me say, Mr. Pillgrim, that flattery and threats are all the same to me." "Somers, you have me on the hip." "I know it." "You have won the game." "I know it." "I am in your power." "I know it." Pillgrim appeared to be hopeless and disconcerted. "Somers, I have, in a bank in Philadelphia, fifty thousand dollars." "What bank?" "Excuse me; the confiscation laws are dangerous to men in my situation." "No matter; I will inform the proper officers of the fact, and they can find out what bank." Pillgrim bit his lip. "I will give you this money if you will--" "Silence, sir! There is not money enough in the whole world to bribe me." "I still have the oath of allegiance--signed by you, and--" "No, you haven't. Mr. Hackleford has it. You left it in your state-room." "Now listen to reason, Somers." "I shall. Reason counsels me to do my duty." "Somers, I will be revenged." "Good night, Mr. Pillgrim. I see you have nothing of importance to say to me;" and Somers went on deck after calling the marine back to his post. CHAPTER XV. THE PRISONER IN THE CABIN. Mr. Pillgrim's wound, as such injuries are regarded in the army and navy, was a mere scratch; but it might have been very sore, and might have ached severely. The traitor did not even mention it in his interview with Somers, for the sore in his mind was much more serious. His victim had now become his tyrant; not implacable or vindictive, but firm and unyielding in the discharge of his duty. Somers went on deck, satisfied himself in regard to the course of the steamer, then visited the engine-room, and other parts of the vessel, until he had assured himself that everything was right. It was a fine, clear night, and when the port watch came on deck, he went below, and lay down on the broad sofa, which extended across the after part of the cabin. He was tired enough to sleep, and he did sleep till the starboard watch was called in the morning. He was a prudent and zealous commander, and he hastened on deck at once to make sure that his charge was still safe. The weather continued fine, and every man was at his post. He scrutinized the log slate, and questioned the officer of the deck. Everything had been correctly done; nothing had happened, and nothing was likely to happen. There was nothing for him to do but sleep, and he returned to his couch in the cabin, to complete his nap. The sentinel at the door of the prisoner's state-room was still in position. The guard was relieved every two hours, and the door was secured on the outside by a padlock, which had been put on by the armorer after the vessel was captured. Of course there could be no doubt in regard to the safety of the prisoner. Somers went to sleep again, satisfied that he had neglected no precautions to insure the safety of the vessel and the prisoner. The movements of the steward in the cabin awoke him at six o'clock. He had slept away all his fatigue, and when he looked out through the stern lights upon a smooth sea, brightened by the morning sun, all his anxiety left him. It was hardly possible that any accident could interfere with the safe arrival of the prize at her destined port. As he rose from the sofa, the corporal of marines relieved the sentry at the prisoner's door. "Marine," said Somers, as the man passed him on his way out of the cabin. The sentinel stopped and touched his cap. "How is the prisoner?" "I haven't heard anything of him, sir, during my beat," replied the marine. "Isn't he up yet?" "I didn't hear him, sir. He's a heavy sleeper, I should say, for I don't think he moved while I was on guard." As Somers had the key of the padlock in his pocket, he was satisfied it was all right with the prisoner, and he went on deck. At seven bells, when his breakfast was brought down, he directed the steward to give Mr. Pillgrim his morning meal, handing the key of the state-room to the corporal. The door was opened, and the marine entered the little room. Somers sat down at the table to eat his breakfast. He was blessed with a good appetite, and some "'am and heggs," which the steward particularly recommended, looked very inviting. But he had hardly satisfied himself that the steward had not overrated the quality of his viands, before his attention was attracted by an exclamation from the corporal of marines. "What's the matter?" demanded Somers, rising from the table, and rushing to the state-room. "Mr. Pillgrim is not here, sir," replied the man. "Not here!" "No, sir." "He can't be far off." Somers entered the state-room. Certainly the prisoner was not there; nor was there any indication of the means by which he had departed. The partitions between this and the adjoining state-rooms were undisturbed. The door had been securely locked, and the key was in the pocket of the commanding officer. The traitor could not have crawled through the bull's eye which lighted the room, for it was not more than nine inches in diameter. The marines who had been on guard during the night were summoned. They all told the same story; not a sound had been heard in the room. Both the master's mates who had kept the watches on deck were examined, but they had no information to communicate. "This is very remarkable," said Somers to his first officer. "Very remarkable," replied Mr. Hudson, who seemed to be even more bewildered than his commander. "Where is Captain Walmsley?" asked Somers of the steward. "I don't know, sir. I 'aven't seen him since 'e hate his supper last night." "See if he is in his state-room, steward." He was not in his state-room. His bed had not been occupied; no one had seen him since the Ben Nevis parted company with the Chatauqua. "Are there any boats missing, Mr. Hudson?" continued Somers. "No, sir; the steamer had two quarter-boats, and a life-boat forward. They are all in their places." "Wasn't there a dingy, or a jolly-boat, at the stern?" "No, sir; I am sure that no boat is missing." "Then of course the prisoner must be on board." "No doubt of that, Mr. Somers. In my opinion he has concealed himself in the hold, and intends to escape after we go into port." "But how could he get into the hold?" "That is more than I know, sir. He isn't in his state-room; he wouldn't have jumped overboard forty miles from land." "He must be found before we make the capes," said Somers, who could not help thinking how "cheap" he should feel if compelled to report the escape of his prisoner to the department. He returned to the table and finished his breakfast, as a matter of necessity now,--for man must eat,--rather than of inclination. The Scotch ham seemed to have lost its fine flavor, and it was really a pity that he had not completed his repast before the escape of Pillgrim was discovered. But Somers was satisfied that the traitor was still on board, and he was determined to find him, even if he had to throw the valuable cargo of the Ben Nevis overboard, in order to effect his purpose. When Somers had worried down his breakfast, he went on deck to detail parties to engage in the search. The hatches were taken off, and Mr. Hudson was directed to examine the hold, while Somers himself, with the marines and a couple of seamen, went to the cabin for the purpose of tracing the fugitive from his starting-point. This appeared to be no easy matter, for as yet there was not the slightest clew to his means of egress. Somers opened the door of the state-room, which had been occupied by the prisoner, and there, to his utter astonishment and confusion, he saw Pillgrim, sitting on a stool, and looking as composed as though nothing had happened. Somers could hardly believe the evidence of his own eyes. "Good morning, Mr. Somers," said the traitor. "I am happy to see you. I was just thinking it was about breakfast time." "Haven't you had your breakfast yet?" asked Somers, who deemed it best to talk at random. "How should I? You lock the door, and confine me to a very limited sphere of observation. I hope you don't intend to starve me." "O, no, by no means. I thought it likely you had breakfasted while on your travels." "On my travels?" said the prisoner, inquiringly. "You have been out of your room." "I?" Pillgrim opened his eyes, and seemed to be astonished. "Certainly you have. When we opened the door half an hour since, you were not here. Perhaps you will not object to telling me where you have been." "I have not been out of my state-room, as you must be aware." "But you have," replied Somers, stoutly. "Am I to infer that you accuse me of lying, Mr. Somers?" demanded the traitor, with an exhibition of dignity. "I accuse you of nothing; I only say you have been out of your state-room." "But I say I have not. I am your prisoner: it is hardly magnanimous to insult me in my present situation." "Are you ready for your breakfast?" asked Somers, unwilling to pursue the conversation on that tack. "A hungry man is always ready for his breakfast. My misfortunes have not impaired my appetite. I am ready for my breakfast." Somers directed the steward to bring the prisoner his morning meal. "Mr. Somers, may I beg the favor of half an hour's conversation with you, when I have done my breakfast?" added Pillgrim. "It is hardly necessary." "Excuse me; it is absolutely necessary for your comfort and safety as well as mine." "Under such a threat, I shall certainly decline," replied Somers, coldly. "I intended no threat. Send these people away, and I will speak." "You may speak or be silent, as you please." Somers stationed a marine at the door, and sent the others away, retiring himself to the farther end of the cabin. He was sorely puzzled to know how the prisoner had got out of his state-room, and why he had returned. He concluded that the opening of the hold had induced the latter step, but the former was still enveloped in mystery. He determined to give the prisoner another room, and make a more careful search in the one he now occupied. When Pillgrim had done his breakfast, Somers called a couple of marines, and ordered them to put the prisoner in the aftermost room. The hasp and padlock were then transferred to the occupied room. "Mr. Somers," said Pillgrim, as he was about to lock the door, "I should like to speak with you." The tone was gentlemanly, and even supplicating, and Somers entered the room, closing the door behind him; but he was careful to cock his revolver as he did so, for the prisoner was a desperate man. "I am ready to hear you." "It is well you are." "If you have any threats to make, I will not remain." "Let me speak only the truth," said Pillgrim, as he looked at his watch. "In twenty minutes from now, we shall all be in kingdom come." There was a malignant smile on the face of the traitor as he spoke, and it was plain to Somers that the villain did not speak without a cause. "Somers, you have beaten me in the last game we played. I shall beat in the next one." "I told you I did not come here to listen to threats." "You will be a dead man in seventeen minutes, Somers," continued Pillgrim, glancing at his watch again. "I could not deny myself the satisfaction of informing you of the fact. But, Somers, you will have the pleasure of knowing that I shall share your fate." "What do you mean, you villain?" demanded Somers, horrified by the thought suggested by the traitor's words. "Gently, my dear fellow. Don't use hard words. But I am glad to see you are moved. Ah, Somers, I have you now," said the wretch, in mocking tones. "Speak!" roared Somers, drawing his pistol. "Shoot me, Somers. I will thank you if you will. It is better to be shot dead, than to be blown up, mangled, and then, after enduring a moment or an hour of agony, to be drowned. Fire, Somers!" He restored the revolver to his belt, appalled by the terrible picture which the villain painted. "Somers, I did leave my state-room. I was not willing to acknowledge it before your crew." "How?" "I have not time to explain. There are but ten minutes of life left to you and me. We will not waste them in what is of so little consequence to either of us. You know of what the cargo of the Ben Nevis is composed?" "I do--of arms, ammunition, and provisions." "Correct; the ammunition is stowed in the after part of the ship--under us, in fact. Captain Walmsley and myself have laid a train by which the vessel will be blown up when four bells strike. It wants five minutes of the time. Captain Walmsley is in a position where he can hear the bell," continued Pillgrim with perfect coolness. "Marine," said Somers, opening the door. "Here, sir," responded the man. "Pass the word for the quartermaster to strike four bells, instantly," added the young commander. "I am ready, Mr. Pillgrim." The traitor looked aghast. CHAPTER XVI. CAPTAIN WALMSLEY. "Mr. Pillgrim, I am not to be intimidated by any such stuff," said Somers, when he had ordered the bells to be struck, which would produce the explosion. "Perhaps Captain Walmsley will not think it best to fire the ammunition at the moment agreed upon; some discretion on this point was left with him; but I assure you, on my word and honor, that the train is laid which will blow up the Ben Nevis," said Pillgrim, earnestly. "If you had not mentioned the name of Captain Walmsley, I might have believed you. As it is, I do not. Your word and honor do not weigh much with me." "Don't insult me." "I simply speak the truth. There! do you hear four bells?" "I do; and if you are not blown up in half a minute, you may thank Captain Walmsley for his moderation." "He is not villain enough to destroy the lives of forty men, his own people as well as mine, to gratify your malice and revenge. I give you _my_ word and honor that he will do nothing of the kind." Pillgrim looked hard at him, and seemed to be slightly disconcerted by the obstinacy of Somers. "If he will not, I will!" said he, fiercely. "I purpose to put you in irons, when you have said all you have to say." "In irons, Somers!" exclaimed the traitor, springing to his feet, his face flushed with indignation. "Since you are open enough to announce your intentions, it is plainly my duty to defeat them. Acknowledge that your plot to blow up the vessel is a mere scare, and I may spare you this indignity." "You will find that it is a reality." "Why don't it blow up, then?" "It will, as soon as Captain Walmsley is ready. The Ben Nevis shall not again go into a Yankee port as a prize. Mark my words." "Captain Somers," called Mr. Hudson. "What is wanted?" "The men in the hold report a smell of fire there." "I will be with you soon," replied Somers, convinced by this message that there was some foundation for the threats of the traitor. "Go into the hold, Mr. Hudson, and find the fire, if there is any." He was cool, and did not permit the wretch before him to see a muscle of his face move. "There is fire there, Somers," said Pillgrim. "I know just where it is. In a few minutes it will reach the ammunition boxes." "Corporal," said Somers, opening the door again. "Here, sir." "Put the prisoner in irons, hands and feet," continued Somers. "Do you mean that, Mr. Somers?" asked Pillgrim, quivering with emotion. "I do mean it, and I shall stand by till it is done." "Will you leave me in the midst of the fire, ironed hand and foot?" "I will. You kindled the fire; and if you perish by it, blame yourself." Pillgrim attempted to resist the execution of the order, but the marines were resolute, and he was fully ironed in spite of his struggles. "Now lock him in," said Somers. "One word, Mr. Somers." "Not another word;" and the young commander hastened from the state-room, and made his way to the scene of peril in the hold. He did not believe that even Pillgrim was stupid enough to blow up the Ben Nevis for mere revenge; and Captain Walmsley certainly would do nothing of the kind, for he could have no strong feeling on the subject, at least not enough to sacrifice the lives of himself and his crew. There was a smell of fire in the hold--the hold filled with powder, shells, and other combustibles. This fact tended to confirm the statement of the wretch; yet Somers was incredulous. When he reached the scene of danger he found the officers and the men timid about proceeding far into the hold, for if there was fire, there must soon be an explosion. "Follow me, my men!" said he, as he walked aft on the cargo. "Ay, ay, sir!" cheerfully responded the men,--for the American seaman will go anywhere an officer will lead him. In the after part of the hold there was a dense smoke and a strong smell of fire. "Keep back! You are all dead men!" shouted Captain Walmsley, as Somers advanced and discovered the speaker seated on a box. "What are you doing here?" demanded Somers. "I am going to blow up the steamer," replied the captain, who held in his hand a tin pan filled with burning oakum, chips, and other combustible material. "Well, why don't you do it, then?" said Somers. "For God's sake, Mr. Somers, don't stay here," pleaded Mr. Hudson. "You needn't, if you are afraid," replied he, coolly. "Mr. Somers, in one instant I can blow the Ben Nevis all to pieces," said Captain Walmsley, with a proper exhibition of tragic adjuncts. "Why don't you do it, then?" "I am willing to give you one chance to save your lives." "You are very considerate. Mr. Pillgrim was going to blow her up for my special benefit." "If you think I am not in earnest, you are greatly mistaken," continued the captain, as he stirred up the burning substances in the pan. "I see you are in earnest, and I am waiting for you to blow her up." "I will give you ten minutes to save your lives; for I have sworn this vessel shall never go into port as a prize. You and your people can take to the boats and save yourselves." "Will you blow her up when we are gone?" "I will." "I have had quite enough of this, Captain Walmsley," said Somers, advancing to the fire king, revolver in hand. "Now go on deck, or I will blow your brains out, if you have any." The captain looked at the revolver, and he might as well have acknowledged his defeat, for his face proclaimed it. "If I should drop this into the cargo, it would blow up the ship." "No, it wouldn't. There are nothing but solid shot and shell under you," replied Somers; and perhaps his coolness and self-possession were in a great measure due to his knowledge of this fact, for he had carefully inspected the cargo immediately after the capture of the vessel. Captain Walmsley, with the blazing censer in his hand, made his way over the boxes, bales, and barrels which lay above the heavy articles, to the hatchway. The pan and its contents were thrown overboard, and the men informed that there was no danger. The captain was ordered into the cabin, where he was put in double irons, as his fellow-conspirator had been. He protested, at first, against this indignity. Then he begged, declaring that Mr. Pillgrim was the author of the plot by which it was intended to recapture the steamer. It was fully believed that Somers and his crew would abandon the vessel as soon as it was announced that there was fire in the hold, knowing that her cargo would readily explode. Captain Walmsley declared that Pillgrim was a fool; if he had kept still till the fire was discovered, instead of declaiming over it beforehand, the plan would have succeeded. Somers doubted it; and when the humiliated captain was ironed, he was sent into his state-room, and a sentinel placed at his door. This business was hardly completed before the marine in charge of Pillgrim informed Somers that his prisoner wished to speak with him. The request was peremptorily refused. "There, Mr. Hudson, I think we have fixed those fellows so that we shall know where to find them when we want them," said Somers, when the conspirators had been disposed of. "Yes, sir; and if any other man had been in charge of this vessel, he would have lost her, Captain Somers. I should have voted for abandoning her as soon as I was satisfied that she was on fire." "Perhaps I should, if I had not known the powder and shells were in the fore hold. But I did not believe the villains had pluck enough to blow themselves up for the sake of blowing me up. If there had been any real danger, they would have been the first to run away." "Well, sir, I think you have managed them exceedingly well." Somers was perfectly willing he should think so, and perhaps he thought so himself. At any rate, he was heartily rejoiced to get out of the scrape so easily, and fully resolved that the conspirators should have no further opportunity to exercise their talents at plotting on board the Ben Nevis. There was a mystery still unsolved to the young officer, and with Mr. Hudson he repaired to the state-room in which Pillgrim had passed the night,--or ought to have passed it,--and commenced a further examination. There was nothing supernatural, or even very remarkable, in the absence of the prisoner, when the carpet was pulled up, and a square aperture, now closed by a pine board, was discovered in the corner of the room. In the ceiling there was a similar aperture, which had been filled up to correspond with the deck above. It was evident that a ventilator, which had been used to convey fresh air to the after hold, had been removed at some recent period. As Captain Walmsley had indicated this state-room for the use of Pillgrim, it was probable that he had chosen it on account of this means of egress. Some time in the night he must have visited the prisoner, entering through this aperture, and conducted him to the hold below. In the fine weather and smooth sea the Ben Nevis nearly made good the claim of the conspirators in regard to her speed, for all day she logged fifteen knots, and at three bells in the first dog watch Cape Henry was sighted, and at ten o'clock in the evening she anchored off Fortress Monroe. By the first conveyance Mr. Hudson was sent to Washington with the despatches of Captain Cascabel, and one from Somers. On the second day the messenger returned, with orders from the department. The young officer took the bundle of documents into the cabin, and proceeded to examine those directed to himself. He was ordered to hand his prisoners over to the commandant of the fort, to deliver his vessel into the keeping of the senior naval officer on the station, and to rejoin his ship forthwith, taking passage in a supply steamer to sail on the following day. He was highly commended for the skill and energy with which he had discharged his duty on board the Ben Nevis, full particulars of which had been communicated by Mr. Hudson. Another document contained his commission as master, the next rank above that of ensign, which had been solicited by Captain Cascabel. This paper was full of interest to the recipient of it, and he was obliged to open the long letters he had written to his mother and to Kate Portington, in order to add, in a postscript, this important intelligence. He was proud and happy, and more than ever satisfied that republics are not ungrateful, notwithstanding the tradition to the contrary. At the proper time he proceeded to execute his orders in regard to the vessel and the prisoners. Pillgrim and his fellow-conspirator were brought on deck. The former looked easy and defiant, as usual, and assured his captor that he should be at liberty in a few days. "Perhaps not," said Somers. "You shall yet be cheated of your victim, but I shall not be cheated of mine," said he, with a malignant smile. "I bear you no malice, Mr. Pillgrim." "I do bear you malice; and the heaviest revenge that ever fell on man shall fall on you before the end of this year." "Your threats are idle. I have heard too many of them. Pass into the boat, if you please." Pillgrim and Walmsley went over the side, and the boat pulled away. The chivalrous military officer removed the irons from their legs and arms as soon as he received them. The Ben Nevis was to be sent to New York to be condemned, and Somers handed her over to the naval officer, according to his orders. CHAPTER XVII. OFF MOBILE BAY. Somers was now entirely relieved from duty. He had delivered up the prize and handed the prisoners over to the proper officers. On the following day he went on shore to spend a few hours before the supply steamer sailed. On visiting the fortress, he received the astonishing intelligence that Mr. Pillgrim had escaped from the officer having him in charge, even before he had been placed in the casement appropriated to his use. Somers had cautioned the lieutenant to whom he had delivered him, of the danger of removing the irons, but his advice had not been heeded. The careless officer was now under arrest for his neglect of duty. By none was this unfortunate event more deeply regretted than by him who had been the means of foiling the schemes of the traitor and handing him over to the custody of the government. Pillgrim had boasted that he would soon be at liberty. He was certainly a talented and a daring fellow; and to handle him safely, it was necessary to understand him thoroughly. Somers had a suspicion that the officer from whom the wretch escaped was bribed by his prisoner; but of course there could be no evidence on this interesting point. A careful search had been made by the garrison of the fort, but without success. Pillgrim was dressed in the full uniform of a naval lieutenant, and in this garb his ingenuity would enable him to pass the military lines, if indeed he was not provided with the means of doing so by the faithless officer in charge of him. The prisoner had escaped on the preceding day, and there was now little hope of recapturing him; but Somers gave such information as he possessed in regard to the fugitive. Captain Walmsley had been less fortunate, and was still in durance. The story of the traitor's escape was a very simple one. When the boat which had conveyed the prisoners from the steamer to the shore reached the pier, and they had landed, Walmsley began to protest against his confinement, being a British subject. He insisted upon seeing the commandant of the fortress; and while everybody was listening to this debate, Pillgrim slipped into the crowd and disappeared, passing the sentinels, who had no suspicion that he was a prisoner, without a challenge. Immediate search was made for him; but he must have taken to the water, since there was no other place of concealment which was not examined. A calker's stage was moored to the shore near the pier, and it was afterwards surmised that he had crawled under this, securing a position so that his head was out of water, and remained there till evening. He was gone, and that was all it was necessary to know. The officer who had permitted him to escape would be court-martialed and broken, and that would be the end of it. At noon, as Somers was about to embark on the supply steamer, a letter was handed to him, which had been brought in by a contraband. The negro said it had been handed to him by "a gemman wid de anchors on his shoulders," whom he had met on the road to Williamsburg, nine miles from the fort. The epistle was from Pillgrim, as Somers would have known from the writing, without the contraband's description of the person who had given it to him. He put it in his pocket, and did not open it till he had taken possession of his state-room on board the steamer. He was confident that it contained nothing but threats and abuse, and he felt but little interest in its contents. The writer, chagrined at the failure of his plot, was running over with evil thoughts and malicious purposes. Somers opened the letter and read as follows:-- OLD POINT COMFORT, July 14. SOMERS: You have been promoted. You remind me of the fable. The goat went down into the well. The fox sprang upon his horns and leaped out. You are the fox; you jumped over my head; you went up; you are a master now. I congratulate you. You are the only man in the world I hate. The Tallahassee is doing a good business for the South. She has captured fifty vessels. The Ben Nevis was her sister. You have her. There are more of the same family. You believe I am used up. No. I write this letter to inform you that I am not even singed yet, say nothing of being burned out. I shall be afloat soon. The Ben Lomond, twin sister of the Ben Nevis and the Tallahassee, will be at work in a fortnight. She will then be called the Tallapoosa. Look out for her. The Ben Nevis was captured; my agents bought her again. The Ben Lomond is now at--you wish you knew where! I shall command her. I could not resist the temptation to inform you of my plan. I know you will enjoy my prospects! You would like to make a little arrangement for the capture of the Ben Lomond. I wish you might. You will hear of her on the broad ocean in a few weeks,--capturing, burning, bonding Yankee ships. It will please you to read the papers then! I shall strike for a California steamer. Her treasure will make good my losses. I am so anxious to meet you again that I am tempted to tell you where my ship is. I would like to meet you on her quarter deck. You are a remarkably enterprising fellow; perhaps we shall meet. If we do, I should feel justified in hanging you at the yard-arm. You belong to the South. You accepted a commission in her navy. You betrayed your trust. I shall _endeavor_ to see you again. Give my regards to the officers of the Chatauqua. Inform them of my present brilliant prospects. Remember me kindly to Kate Portington. Possibly she may be a little _chilly_ when you see her again. If you capture the Ben Lomond, otherwise the Tallapoosa, it would make you a lieutenant. Do it by all means. PILLGRIM. Somers read this singular letter three times before he could form an opinion whether or not its statements were mere idle boasts, and whether or not they had a foundation of truth. Was there any such vessel in existence as the Ben Lomond? This was the interesting and important question to him. At this time the Tallahassee was making fearful ravages among the shipping on the coast, and the success and impunity with which she carried on her depredations offered plenty of encouragement for the rebels to send forth similar vessels, if they could obtain them. The Ben Nevis had been named after a mountain in Scotland; Ben Lomond was the name of another. The former was a Clyde-built vessel, and it would have been natural to give these twin names to twin steamers. Pillgrim, in the character of "Coles," had given him a certain amount of correct information in respect to the Ben Nevis, though he had deceived him in regard to her destination. He had obtained this knowledge by accident, and the Ben Nevis had been captured. To Somers there appeared to be a strong probability that the statements contained in the letter were wholly or partially true. There were only two rebel ports into which it was possible for the Ben Lomond to have run--Mobile and Wilmington. The conspirators had told him that the Ben Nevis was bound to Mobile when she was actually going to Wilmington. Pillgrim, in his letter, declared that he was to command the Tallapoosa. If there was any plan at all, of course it had been laid before the Chatauqua sailed from Philadelphia. Why did Pillgrim start for Mobile in the Chatauqua? Was it not possible that he intended, as second lieutenant of a national ship, to obtain the means of getting the Ben Lomond, or Tallapoosa, through the blockading fleet? Did he not endeavor to involve the fourth lieutenant in the meshes of the conspiracy for the purpose of obtaining his assistance in this work? It was plausible. Perhaps the recreant wretch had left some papers in his state-room on board the Chatauqua, which would be intelligible in the light which he could bring to bear upon them. Bewildered and astonished by the prospect before him, as he read the letter again and again, and considered its remarkable statements in connection with his previous knowledge, Somers spent the whole afternoon in his state-room, and was only aroused from his meditations by the supper bell. In the evening he resumed his study of the case, and tried to reconcile the theory he had framed with reason and common sense. There was nothing to conflict with this theory but the fact that Pillgrim himself had given him the information upon which it was based. The traitor would not intentionally betray himself. Perhaps he did not expect his statements would be credited; or if he did, he had twice before been equally reckless. Then Somers attempted to analyze the mental constitution of Pillgrim. The conspirator seemed to be able to endure all misfortunes. The loss of the Ben Nevis had not affected him, and he had endangered, defeated his plan to recapture her by indulging in idle threats before the match was applied. He had been more desirous of mortifying, humiliating, and overwhelming Somers, than of recovering his lost steamer. With great talents for scheming and plotting, he had displayed the most amazing stupidity. At this point the remark to the letter that Kate Portington would be _chilly_ when he saw her again, came up for consideration. Pillgrim certainly had some purpose in view which was equal to, or greater than, his desire to serve the South, or even himself, in a pecuniary point of view. He was the friend of the commodore--had known the family before the war. Somers could not help believing that, in spite of his thirty-five years, he was an aspirant for the hand of Kate, and that the bond he had signed was for her use rather than his own. Miss Portington might well be _chilly_, if she discovered that Somers had pledged a part of her fortune at the present stage of proceedings! Somers was nervous and uneasy until he had reasoned and coaxed himself into a full belief in the theory which he had suggested. He could not wait for evidence, if, indeed, any could be obtained. For the present he was satisfied, and determined to proceed upon his hypothesis, just as though every point in the argument had been fully substantiated. Our young officer was never idle when it was possible to work. If any of our readers believe that Somers was very "smart," very skilful, and very fortunate in his previous career, we beg to remind them, and to impress it upon their minds in the most forcible manner, that he owed more to his industry and perseverance than to the accidents of natural ability and favorable circumstances combined. For example, when he captured the Ben Nevis, instead of gaping idly about the deck, and thinking what a great man he was, he went into the hold, and made a careful examination of the steamer's cargo. The knowledge thus gained had prevented him from abandoning the vessel when she was believed to be on fire, and thus saved the prize and confounded the conspirators. Somers was not idle now. He procured "Blunt's Coast Pilot," and "A Chart of the North Coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from St. Mark's to Galveston," of the captain of the steamer, and diligently studied up, and even committed to memory, the bearings, distances, and depths of water in Mobile Bay and vicinity. He carefully trained his mind on these matters so important to a seaman; and being blessed with a retentive memory, he hoped and expected to have this knowledge at command when it should be serviceable. It was hard study--the hardest and dryest kind of study; but he stuck to it as though it had been a bewitching novel. To assist his design he drew maps and charts of the coast from memory, and was not satisfied till he could make a perfect diagram of the coast, shoals, islands, and bars, mark the prominent objects to be sighted from a vessel, and lay down the depth of water. He had nothing else to do on the passage; and as the steamer glided swiftly over the summer sea, he found it a more agreeable occupation than smoking, playing cards, and "spinning yarns," which were the employments of his fellow-passengers. On the eighth day from Fortress Monroe the supply steamer reached the blockading fleet off Mobile Bay, and Somers was warmly welcomed by his brother officers. Of course he had a long story to tell, which was listened to with interest. The escape of the late second lieutenant was received with becoming indignation. Somers was now the third lieutenant of the Chatauqua, and he moved into the state-room formerly occupied by Mr. Garboard, who had also advanced one grade in his relative rank. "Somers, you are just in time for a big thing," said Mr. Hackleford. "Our Brave Old Salt is going to take us up Mobile Bay in a few days." "Indeed?" "Yes, the Old Salamander has issued his orders." "God bless him!" ejaculated Somers, fervently, in much the same spirit that a loyal subject speaks of a popular monarch. "Ay, God bless him!" replied the first lieutenant. "He is the ablest naval commander the world has yet produced. In my opinion he is the superior of Nelson, Collingwood, Decatur, Porter, Preble, and Hull. By the way, Mr. Somers, you were with him on the Mississippi?" "Yes, sir; I was in the Harrisburg when the fleet passed Forts Jackson and St. Philip. But I am rather sorry the attack is to take place so soon." "Why so?" Then Somers showed him Pillgrim's letter; but as we intend to tell only what was done, not what was said, we will not record the conversation. CHAPTER XVIII. BRAVE OLD SALT. The most extensive and careful preparations were in progress for the events which, a few days later, astonished the world even more than the splendid achievements of the fleet below New Orleans. The squadron off the mouth of Mobile Bay had been actively employed for several days in sending down top-masts, superfluous spars, and rigging. Chain cables had been extended over the sides of the ships where the machinery was exposed to injury from the shot and shell of the fort. Chains and sand bags were placed on the decks where plunging shot might disable the engines. Boats were removed from the starboard to the port sides, for the fleet was to go in with Fort Morgan on the right, and close aboard of them. The preparations were advancing when Somers reported on board of the Chatauqua, and of course he at once experienced the inspiration of coming events. If there was any man in the navy whom he admired and reverenced, that man was Admiral Farragut. It is true, he was not singular in this respect, for every man in the fleet was equally devoted to him. The "Old Salamander," who seemed never to be happier than when in the midst of the hottest fire which the engines of modern warfare could produce, was the idol of both officers and seamen. He was an honest, just, and humane man, one who involuntarily won the respect of every person with whom he came into contact. We were never more thoroughly impressed by the honesty, justice, and humanity of a man, than when we took the hand of this "Brave Old Salt." His expressive eye, and his gentle, but dignified bearing, spoke more truly and forcibly of what he was, than the most elaborate biography which the pen of genius could produce. It almost passes belief that men can stand up and work and fight as officers and seamen worked and fought between Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and at Mobile Bay; but we can think of no better inspiration than the leadership of such a man as Admiral Farragut. He was born in Tennessee--a southern state; his home was in Virginia--a southern state--at the breaking out of the rebellion. With all the motives which actuated Lee and Johnston, Tatnall and Hollins, to induce him to abandon the old flag under which he had fought in early youth, and served through all his manhood, he remained true to his country in the hour of her severest trial. Neither bribes nor threats could move him, and not for one instant did he falter in his devotion to the flag he had sworn to sustain against all foes. Glory, honor, and immortality in the hearts of his countrymen to the noble Admiral! As a naval commander, he has no rival in the past or the present, in this or in any country. He has achieved, once, twice, thrice, what any board of naval officers that could have been convened from the boldest and most skilful naval heroes of the united nations, would have solemnly pronounced impossible. Chance might have given him the Lower Mississippi--it did not; but it could not have given him that and Mobile Bay, and the brilliant exploits up the Great River. Chance is capricious; it never metes out uniform success. Admiral Farragut is not simply a brave and skilful seaman, for the stroke of genius shines out in all his battle plans, in all his preparations, and in all his movements, whether on the silent river, as his majestic ship leads in the van to the conflict, or under the most deadly and destructive fire that ever was rained down on a wooden hull. "Brave Old Salt" in the main rigging of the Hartford, as she breasted the storm of shot and shell from Fort Morgan, is a spectacle more sublime than can be presented in the annals of any other nation. The position he chose for himself on that momentous occasion, more truly indicates the key to his marvellous success than any other fact in connection with the battle. He was not there to expose himself needlessly to deadly peril; he was there to see and take advantage of the issues of the battle. His position was a symbol of the intelligence and bravery which won the great battle. He saw with his own eyes--not with others; while his glorious personal devotion was a type for every other man, which was imitated from commodores down to powder-boys. We read of a general who could not remember where he was during one of the severest and most destructive fights of the war. If he had been in a position corresponding to that of the doughty old admiral, it would have been difficult for him to forget it. But personal bravery alone does not win the battle on the sea or the land. The admiral's victories are due even more to his genius--to his persevering industry in the elaboration of preparatory details. "Brave Old Salt," as Somers always called him, was our young officer's beau-ideal of a naval commander. "Brave" he certainly was, and "Old Salt," to a sailor, means something more than a long experience at sea. It conveys to the nautical mind an idea of skill which no "lubber" can possess. It was bravery, seamanship, and those peculiar qualities which an "old salt" possesses, that made him great on the quarter deck, in command of a squadron. Somers's admiration for the commander-in-chief of the fleet off Mobile Bay was of no recent origin. Since he had first known him as "Flag Officer Farragut" at Ship Island, before the grade of Rear and Vice Admiral had been created in our navy, he had reverenced him as a superior man, and looked up to him with an almost superstitious awe. He could hardly realize that they were both of the same earthly mould, with the like human hopes and aspirations. Though, for a young man of his age, Somers regarded his rank of master as very high, it did not permit him to abate one jot or tittle of the distance which lay between him and the admiral. He did not feel any better entitled to tread the same deck with the glorious old hero, as a master, than he did as an ordinary seaman. Somers returned to active duty as soon as he had reported to the first lieutenant of the Chatauqua, and he had the deck in the first dog watch on the day of his arrival. During the afternoon watch he had had plenty of time to report the incidents of his cruise in the Ben Nevis. Mr. Hackleford had immediately communicated to the captain the facts concerning Pillgrim's letter, and the recreant lieutenant's papers had been carefully overhauled in search of anything which would shed a ray of light upon the statements of the strange letter. The only document which looked at all hopeful was a note written in cipher, to which there was no key among the papers. If the communication had been in Chinese or Chaldaic, there might have been a chance of unravelling it; as it was, the note was written in arbitrary characters, which were as cabalistic and unintelligible as the Egyptian hieroglyphics. Somers was annoyed and discomfited, for he had confidently reckoned upon finding some letter which contained a hint to guide him. There was nothing but this note in cipher. To add to his chagrin, Mr. Hackleford was utterly sceptical in regard to Pillgrim's letter--did not believe the first word of it--called it "gas," and declared that it would be stupid and childish to pay the least attention to the document. Captain Cascabel fully concurred with him in this opinion, and both of them laughed at Somers for bestowing a second thought upon it. "Nonsense! Mr. Somers!" exclaimed the first lieutenant. "There isn't a single scintillation of truth in the story. If there were even a glimmering of reality in the thing, I would look into it." "But Mr. Pillgrim told me some truth in regard to the Ben Nevis," argued Somers. "That is the best reason in the world for believing he has not done so in this instance," said Mr. Hackleford. "I suppose I must give up the idea, then." "You must, indeed. If you don't, I am afraid your reputation for common sense and good judgment will suffer." "Will you allow me to take this letter in cipher, and keep it till to-morrow?" asked Somers. "Certainly." Somers took the letter, and put it into his pocket until he had an opportunity to study its mystic characters. He was mortified by the rebuff he had received, but his faith, though somewhat shaken, was not destroyed. He was officer of the deck from four till six. Just before he was relieved, he ordered the side to be manned to receive the captain, who was just returning from a visit to the flag-ship. As he touched his cap to Captain Cascabel, he noticed a smile on his commander's face, which seemed to relate to him, and he blushed beneath the pleasant, but expressive glance bestowed upon him. "Mr. Somers," said the captain. The officer of the deck stepped forward, and saluted the commander again. "You are invited to dine with Admiral Farragut to-morrow afternoon." "I, sir!" exclaimed Somers, completely overwhelmed by this remarkable declaration. "Rear Admiral Farragut presents his compliments to Mr. Somers, and would be happy to see him at dinner to-morrow, on board the Hartford." The captain passed on to the companion-way, leading to his cabin, leaving Somers as bewildered as though he had been invited to dine with Queen Victoria, Louis Napoleon, and the Emperor of Russia; indeed, he regarded it as a much greater honor to dine with "Brave Old Salt," than to put his feet under the mahogany of the mightiest crowned head of the world. It was evident that somebody had been talking to the admiral about him; the captain and the first lieutenant of the Chatauqua certainly felt kindly enough towards him to do so. To dine with Admiral Farragut! That was glory enough for a lifetime; or at least to be deemed worthy of such a distinction. Our friend Somers was no snob; he "looked up" to great people, especially to those who were really great. He pretended to no familiarity with his superiors, though some of the officers were dying with envy at the notice taken of him by the captain and first lieutenant of the ship. He did not assume to be familiar with men who had won a deathless fame in defending their country's cause. Perhaps there was not an officer in the fleet who would so highly appreciate such a compliment as that of which he was now the happy recipient. When he was relieved from the deck, and went down into the ward-room, the news had gone before him, and the "idlers" there congratulated him upon his rising fame. But Somers broke away from them as soon as he could decently do so, and shut himself up in his state-room. He was actually dizzy at the idea of sitting down at the table with "Brave Old Salt" in the cabin of the Hartford; and though he took the cabalistic note of Mr. Pillgrim from his pocket, at least half an hour was wasted before he could apply his mind undividedly to the difficult problem before him. Finally, the hope of making a grand revelation to the admiral on the morrow fired his zeal to such a pitch that the work looked like play to him. Somers opened the mysterious document and spread it out on the desk, at which he seated himself. It looked dark and hopeless, with its dots and dashes, its horizontals and perpendiculars, its curves and crosses. We present the note in full, that our readers may be able to appreciate the difficulty of the task he had undertaken. [Illustration] If Somers had been a student of the occult sciences, he might have been more hopeful. An hour's hard study brought a gleam of light. He thought the note must be signed by Langdon. There were seven letters in the signature. This was his first ray of hope. He then placed all the letters of the alphabet in a column, and against each made the character that represented it in the cipher. Six letters were thus interpreted. The next step was to place each of the letters thus discovered over its sign the affair. I went to Polly Singleton's auction because Rosalind Merton raised the demon in me. I tried to become the possessor of the sealskin jacket because her heart was set on it. I won an eighty-guinea jacket for ten guineas. You see how ignoble my motives were, also how unworthy the results. I did worse even than that--for I will out with the truth to you, Nancy--I revenged myself still further upon that spiteful little gnat, Rosalind, and raised the price of her coveted coral to such an extent that I know by her face she is pounds in debt for it. Now, my dear, what have you to say to me? Nothing good, I know that. Let me read Aristotle for the next hour just to calm my mind." Maggie turned away, seated herself by her writing bureau, and tried to lose both the past and the present in her beloved Greek. "She will do it, too," whispered Nancy as she left the room. "No one ever was made quite like Maggie. She can feel tortures, and yet the next moment she can be in ecstasy. She is so tantalising that at times you are almost brought to believe her own stories about herself. You are almost sure that she has got the black self as well as the white self. But through it all, yes, through it all, you love her. Dear Maggie! Whatever happens, I must always--always love her." Nancy was walking slowly down the corridor when a room door was gently opened, and the sweet childish innocent face of Rosalind peeped out. "Nancy, is that you? Do, for Heaven's sake, come in and speak to me for a moment." "What about, Rosalind? I have only a minute or two to spare. My German lecture is to begin immediately." "Oh, what does that signify? You don't know the awful trouble we've got into." "You mean about the auction?" "Yes--yes; so you have heard?" "Of course I've heard. If that is all, Rosalind, I cannot wait to discuss the matter now. I am very sorry for you, of course, but as I said to Maggie, why did you do it?" "Oh, you've been talking to Miss Oliphant? Thank goodness she'll have to answer for her sins as well as the rest of us." "Maggie is my friend, so you need not abuse her, Rosalind." "Lucky for her that she has got one true friend!" retorted Rosalind. "What do you mean?" "I mean what I say. Maggie is making such a fool of herself that we are all laughing at her behind her back." "Indeed? I fail to understand you." "You are being made a fool of, too, Nancy. Oh, I did think you'd have had more sense." "How? Speak. Say at once what you want to say, Rosalind, and stop talking riddles, for I must fly to my work." "Fly, then," retorted Rosalind, "only think twice before you give your confidence to a _certain person_. A person who makes a fine parade of poverty and so-called honesty of purpose, but who can, and who does, betray her kindest and best friend behind her back. It is my private belief we have to thank this virtuous being for getting us into the pleasant scrape we are in. I am convinced she has tried to curry favour by telling Miss Heath all about poor Polly's auction." "You mean Priscilla Peel?" said Nancy, in a firm voice. She forgot her German lecture now. "You have no right to say words of that kind. You have taken a dislike to Prissie, no one knows why. She is not as interesting nor as beautiful as Maggie, but she is good, and you should respect her." Rosalind laughed bitterly. "Good? Is she? Ask Mr Hammond. You say she is not beautiful nor interesting. Perhaps he finds her both. Ask him." "Rosalind, I shall tell Maggie what you say. This is not the first time you have hinted unkind things about Priscilla. It is better to sift a matter of this kind to the bottom than to hint it all over the college as you are doing Maggie shall take it in hand." "Let her! I shall only be too delighted! What a jolly time the saintly Priscilla will have." "I can't stay any longer, Rosalind." "But, Nancy, just one moment. I want to put accounts right with Polly before to-night. Mother sent me ten pounds to buy something at the auction. The coral cost fourteen guineas. I have written to mother for the balance, and it may come by any post. _Do_ lend it to me until it comes! _Do_, kind Nancy!" "I have not got so much in the world, I have not really, Rosalind. Good-bye; my lecture will have begun." Nancy ran out of the room, and Miss Merton turned to survey ruefully her empty purse, and to read again a letter which had already arrived from her mother:-- "My Dear Rosalind-- "I have not the additional money to spare you, my poor child. The ten pounds which I weakly yielded at your first earnest request was, in reality, taken from the money which is to buy your sisters their winter dresses. I dare not encroach any further on it, or your father would certainly ask me why the girls were dressed so shabbily. Fourteen guineas for coral! You know, my dear child, we cannot afford this extravagance. My advice is to return it to your friend, and to ask her to let you have the ten guineas back. You might return it to me in a Postal Order, for I want it badly. It was one thing to struggle to let you have it in the hopes that you would secure a really valuable garment like a sealskin jacket, and another to give it to you for some rather useless ornaments. "Your affectionate mother,-- "Alice Merton." CHAPTER NINETEEN. IN MISS ECCLESTON'S SITTING-ROOM. Miss Eccleston was a dark, heavy-looking person; she was not as attractive either in appearance or manner as Miss Heath. She was estimable, and the college authorities thought most highly of her, but her character possessed more hardness than softness, and she was not as popular with the girls and young lecturers who lived in Katharine Hall as was Miss Heath with her girls. When Maggie entered Miss Eccleston's sitting-room that evening, she found the room about half-full of eager, excited-looking girls. Miss Eccleston was standing up and speaking; Miss Heath was leaning against the wall; a velvet curtain made a background which brought out her massive and grand figure in full relief. Miss Eccleston looked excited and angry; Miss Heath's expression was a little perplexed, and a kind of sorrowful mirth brought smiles to her lips now and then, which she was most careful to suppress instantly. As Maggie made her way to the front of the room she recognised several of the girls. Rosalind Merton, Annie Day, Lucy Marsh, were all present. She saw them, although they were standing hidden behind many other girls. Prissie, too, was there--she had squeezed herself into a corner. She looked awkward, plain, and wretched. She was clasping and unclasping her hands, and trying to subdue the nervous tremors which she could not conceal. Maggie, as she walked across the room, singled Prissie out. She gave her a swift glance, a brilliant and affectionate smile, and then stood in such a position that neither Miss Eccleston nor Miss Heath could catch a glimpse of her. Miss Eccleston, who had been speaking when Maggie entered the room, was now silent. She had a note-book in her hand, and was rapidly writing something in it with a pencil. Someone gave Maggie a rather severe prod on her elbow. Polly Singleton, tall, flushed, and heavy, stood close to her side. "You'll stand up for me, won't you, Miss Oliphant?" whispered Polly. Maggie raised her eyes, looked at the girl, who was even taller than herself, and began to reply in her usual voice. "Silence," said Miss Eccleston. She put down her note-book. "I wish for no conversation between you at the present moment, young ladies. Good-evening, Miss Oliphant; I am pleased to see you here. I shall have a few questions to ask you in a minute. Now, Miss Singleton, if you please, we will resume our conversation. You have confessed to the fact of the auction. I wish now to ascertain what your motive was." Poor Polly stammered and reddened, twisted her hands as badly as Prissie herself could have done, and looked to right and left of her in the most bewildered and unhappy manner. "Don't you hear me, Miss Singleton? I wish to know what your motive was in having an auction in Katharine Hall," repeated Miss Eccleston. "Tell her the truth," whispered Maggie. Polly, who was in a condition to catch even at a straw for support, said, falteringly-- "I had the auction in my room because of dad." Miss Eccleston raised her brows. The amused smile of sorrow round Miss Heath's mouth became more marked. She came forward a few steps, and stood near Miss Eccleston. "You must explain yourself, Miss Singleton," repeated the latter lady. "Do tell everything," said Maggie, again. "Dad is about the only person I hate vexing," began Polly once more. "He is awfully rich, but he hates me to get into debt, and--and--there was no other way to raise money. I couldn't tell dad--I--_couldn't_ keep out of debt, so I had to sell my things." "You have made a very lame excuse, Miss Singleton," said Miss Eccleston, after a pause. "You did something which was extremely irregular and improper. Your reason for doing it was even worse than the thing itself. You were in debt. The students of St Benet's are not expected to be in debt." "But there's no rule against it," suddenly interrupted Maggie. "Hush! your turn to speak will come presently. You know, Miss Singleton--all the right-minded girls in this college know--that we deal in principles, not rules. Now, please go on with your story." Polly's broken and confused narrative continued for the next five minutes. There were some titters from the girls behind her--even Miss Heath smiled faintly. Miss Eccleston alone remained grave and displeased. "That will do," she said at last. "You are a silly and rash girl, and your only possible defence is your desire to keep the knowledge of your extravagance from your father. Your love for him, however, has never taught you true nobility. Had you that even in the most shadowy degree, you would abstain from the things which he detests. He gives you an ample allowance. Were you a school-girl and I your mistress, I should punish you severely for your conduct." Miss Eccleston paused. Polly put her handkerchief up to her eyes and began to sob loudly. "Miss Oliphant," said Miss Eccleston, "will you please account for the fact that you, who are looked up to in this college, you who are one of our senior students, and for whom Miss Heath has a high regard, took part in the disgraceful scenes which occurred in Miss Singleton's room on Monday evening?" "I shall certainly tell you the truth," retorted Maggie. She paused for a moment. Then, the colour flooding her cheeks, and her eyes looking straight before her, she began-- "I went to Miss Singleton's room knowing that I was doing wrong. I hated to go, and did not take the smallest interest in the proceedings which were being enacted there." She paused again. Her voice, which had been slightly faltering, grew a little firmer. Her eyes met Miss Heath's, which were gazing at her in sorrowful and amazed surprise. Then she continued--"I did not go alone. I took another and perfectly innocent girl with me. She is a newcomer, and this is her first term. She would naturally be led by me, and I wish therefore to exonerate her completely. Her name is Priscilla Peel. She did not buy anything, and she hated being there even more than I did, but I took her hand and absolutely forced her to come with me." "Did you buy anything at the auction, Miss Oliphant?" "Yes, a sealskin jacket." "Do you mind telling me what you paid for it?" "Ten guineas." "Was that, in your opinion, a fair price for the jacket?" "The jacket was worth a great deal more. The price I paid for it was much below its value." Miss Eccleston made some further notes in her book. Then she looked up. "Have you anything more to say, Miss Oliphant?" "I could say more. I could make you think even worse of me than you now think, but as any further disclosures of mine would bring another girl into trouble I would rather not speak." "You are certainly not forced to speak. I am obliged to you for the candour with which you have treated me." Miss Eccleston then turned to Miss Heath, and said a few words to her in a low voice. Her words were not heard by the anxiously listening girls, but they seemed to displease Miss Heath, who shook her head; but Miss Eccleston held very firmly to her own opinion. After a pause of a few minutes, Miss Heath came forward and addressed the young girls who were assembled before her. "The leading spirit of this college," she said, "is almost perfect immunity from the bondage of rules. The Principals of these Halls have fully trusted the students who reside in them, and relied on their honour, their rectitude, their sense of sound principle. Hitherto we have had no reason to complain that the spirit of absolute trust which we have shown has been abused; but the circumstance which has just occurred has given Miss Eccleston and myself some pain." "It has surprised us; it has given us a blow," interrupted Miss Eccleston. "And Miss Eccleston feels," proceeded Miss Heath, "and perhaps she is right, that the matter ought to be laid before the college authorities, who will decide what are the best steps to be taken." "You don't agree with that view, do you, Miss Heath?" asked Maggie Oliphant suddenly. "At first I did not. I leant to the side of mercy. I thought you might all have learnt a lesson in the distress which you have caused us, and that such an occurrence could not happen again." "Won't Miss Eccleston adopt your views?" questioned Maggie. She glanced round at her fellow-students as she spoke. "No--no," interrupted Miss Eccleston. "I cannot accept the responsibility. The college authorities must decide the matter." "Remember," said Maggie, stepping forward a pace or two, "that we are no children. If we were at school you ought to punish us, and, of course, you would. I _hate_ what I have done, and I own it frankly. But you cannot forget, Miss Eccleston, that no girl here has broken a rule when she attended the auction, and bought Miss Singleton's things; and that even Miss Singleton has broken no rule when she went in debt." There was a buzz of applause and even a cheer from the girls in the background. Miss Eccleston looked angry, but perplexed. Miss Heath again turned and spoke to her. She replied in a low tone. Miss Heath said something further. At last Miss Eccleston sat down, and Miss Heath came forward and addressed Maggie Oliphant. "Your words have been scarcely respectful, Miss Oliphant," she said, "but there is a certain justice in them which my friend, Miss Eccleston, is the first to admit. She has consented, therefore, to defer her final decision for twenty-four hours; at the end of that time the students of Katharine Hall and Heath Hall will know what we finally decide to do." After the meeting in Miss Eccleston's drawing-room the affair of the auction assumed enormous proportions. There was no other topic of conversation. The students took sides vigorously in the matter: the gay, giddy, and careless ones voting the auction a rare bit of fun, and upholding those who had taken part in it with all their might and main. The more sober and high-minded girls, on the other hand, took Miss Heath's and Miss Eccleston's views of the matter. The principles of the college had been disregarded, the spirit of order had been broken; debt, which was disgraceful, was made light of. These girls felt that the tone of St Benet's was lowered. Even Maggie Oliphant sank in their estimation. A few went to the length of saying that they could no longer include her in their set. Katharine Hall, the scene of the auction itself, was, of course, now the place of special interest. Heath Hall was also implicated in it, but Seymour Hall, which stood a little apart from its sister Halls, had sent no student to the scene of dissipation. Seymour Hall was the smallest of the three. It was completely isolated from the others, standing in its own lovely grounds on the other side of the road. It now held its head high, and the girls who belonged to the other Halls, but had taken no part in the auction, felt that their own beloved Halls were lowered, and their resentment was all the keener because the Seymour Hall girls gave themselves airs. "I shall never live through it," said Ida Mason, a Heath Hall girl to her favourite chum, Constance Field. "Nothing can ever be the same again. If my mother knew, Constance, I feel almost sure she would remove me. The whole thing is so small and shabby and horrid, and then to think of Maggie taking part in it! Aren't you awfully shocked, Constance? What is your true opinion?" "My true opinion," said Constance, "is this: it is our duty to uphold our own Hall and our own chums. As to the best of us, if we are the best, going away because a thing of this sort has occurred, it is not to be thought of for a moment. Why, Ida," Constance laughed as she spoke, "you might as well expect one of the leading officers to desert his regiment when going into battle. You know what Maggie Oliphant is, Ida. As to deserting her because she has had one of her bad half-hours, which she frankly confessed to, like the brave girl she is, I would as soon cut off my right hand. Now, Ida, my dear, don't be a little goose. Your part, instead of grumbling and growling, and hinting at the place not being fit for you, is to go round to every friend you have in Heath Hall, and get them to rally round Maggie and Miss Heath." "There's that poor Miss Peel, too," said Ida, "Maggie's new friend--that queer, plain girl; she's sure to be frightfully bullied. I suppose I'd better stick up for her as well?" "Of course, dear, you certainly ought. But as to Miss Peel being plain, Ida, I don't think I quite agree with you. Her face is too clever for that. Have you watched her when she acts?" "No, I don't think I have. She seems to be very uninteresting." "Look at her next time, and tell me if you think her uninteresting afterwards. Now I'm off to find Maggie. She is sure to be having one of her bad times, poor darling." Constance Field was a girl whose opinion was always received with respect. Ida went off obediently to fulfil her behests; and Constance, after searching in Maggie's room, and wandering in different parts of the grounds, found the truant at last, comfortably established with a pile of new books and magazines in the library. The library was the most comfortable room in the house, and Maggie was leaning back luxuriously in an easy-chair, reading some notes from a lecture on Aristotle aloud to Prissie, who sat at her feet, and took down notes of her own from Maggie's lips. The two looked up anything but gratefully when Constance approached. Miss Field, however, was not a person to be dismissed with a light and airy word, and Maggie sighed and closed her book when Constance sat down in an armchair, which she pulled close to her. There were no other girls in the library, and Prissie, seeing that Miss Field intended to be confidential, looked at Maggie with a disconsolate air. "Perhaps I had better go up to my own room," she said, timidly. Maggie raised her brows, and spoke in an impatient voice. "You are in no one's way, Priscilla," she said. "Here are my notes from the lecture. I read to the end of this page; you can make out the rest for yourself. Well, Constance, have you anything to say?" "Not unless you want to hear me," said Miss Field, in her dignified manner. Maggie tried to stifle a yawn. "Oh, my dear Connie, I'm always charmed, you know that." "Well, I thought I'd like to tell you that I admired the way you spoke last night." "Were you present?" "No, but some friends of mine were. They repeated the whole thing verbatim." "Oh, you heard it second-hand. Highly coloured, no doubt, and not the least like its poor original." Maggie spoke with a kind of bitter, defiant sarcasm, and a delicate colour, came into Miss Field's cheeks. "At least, I heard enough to assure me that you spoke the truth and concealed nothing," she said. "It is the case that I spoke the truth, as far as it went; but it is not the case that I concealed nothing." "Well, Maggie, I have come to offer you my sincere sympathy." "Thank you," said Maggie. She leant back in her chair, folded her hands, and a tired look came over her expressive face. "The fact is," she said, suddenly, "I am sick of the whole thing. I am sorry I went; I made a public confession of my sorrow last night; now I wish to forget it." "How can you possibly forget it, until you know Miss Heath's and Miss Eccleston's decision?" "Frankly, Constance, I don't care what decision they come to." "You don't care? You don't mind the college authorities knowing?" "I don't care if every college authority in England knows. I have been humbled in the eyes of Miss Heath, whom I love; nothing else matters." When Maggie said these words, Prissie rose to her feet, looked at her with a queer, earnest glance, suddenly bent forward, kissed her frantically, and rushed out of the room. "And I love that dear true-hearted child, too," said Maggie. "Now, Constance, do let us talk of something else." "We'll talk about Miss Peel. I don't know her as you do, but I'm interested in her." "Oh, pray don't; I want to keep her to myself." "Why? Is she such a _rara avis_?" "I don't care what she is. She suits me because she loves me without question. She is absolutely sincere; she could not say an untrue thing; she is so clever that I could not talk frivolities when I am with her; and so good, so really, simply good, that she keeps at bay my bad half-hours and my reckless moods." Constance smiled. She believed part of Maggie's speech; not the whole of it, for she knew the enthusiasm of the speaker. "I am going to Kingsdene," said Maggie suddenly. "Prissie is coming with me. Will you come, too, Constance? I wish you would." "Thank you," said Constance. She hesitated for a moment. "It is the best thing in the world for Heath Hall," she thought, "that the girls should see me walking with Maggie to-day." Aloud she said, "All right, Maggie, I'll go upstairs and put on my hat and jacket, and meet you and Miss Peel in the porch." "We are going to tea at the Marshalls'," said Maggie. "You don't mind that, do you? You know them, too?" "Know them? I should think so. Isn't old Mrs Marshall a picture? And Helen is one of my best friends." "You shall make Helen happy this afternoon, dear Constance." Maggie ran gaily out of the room as she spoke, and a few minutes later the three girls, in excellent spirits, started for Kingsdene. As they entered the town they saw Rosalind Merton coming to meet them. There was nothing in this, for Rosalind was a gay young person, and had many friends in Kingsdene. Few days passed that did not see her in the old town on her way to visit this friend or that, or to perpetrate some little piece of extravagance at Spilman's or at her dressmaker's. On this occasion, however, Rosalind was neither at Spilman's or the dressmaker's. She was walking demurely down the High Street, daintily dressed and charming to look at, in Hammond's company. Rosalind was talking eagerly and earnestly, and Hammond, who was very tall, was bending down to catch her words, when the other three girls came briskly round a corner, and in full view of the pair. "Oh!" exclaimed Priscilla aloud, in her abrupt, startled way. Her face became suffused with a flood of the deepest crimson, and Maggie, who felt a little annoyed at seeing Hammond in Rosalind's company, could not help noticing Prissie's almost uncontrollable agitation. Rosalind, too, blushed, but prettily, when she saw the other three girls come up. "I will say good-bye, now, Mr Hammond," she said, "for I must get back to St Benet's in good time to-night." She held out her hand, which the young man took, and shook cordially. "I am extremely obliged to you," he said. Maggie was near enough to hear his words. Rosalind tripped past her three fellow-students with an airy little nod, and the faint beginning of a mocking curtsy. Hammond came up to the three girls and joined them at once. "Are you going to the Marshalls'?" he said to Maggie. "Yes." "So am I. What a lucky _rencontre_." He said another word or two, and then the four turned to walk down the High Street. Maggie walked on in front with Constance. Hammond fell to Priscilla's share. "I am delighted to see you again," she said, in her eager, agitated, abrupt way. "Are you?" he replied in some astonishment. Then he hastened to say something polite. "I forgot, we had not ended our discussion. You almost convinced me with regard to the superior merits of the `Odyssey,' but not quite. Shall we renew the subject now?" "No, please don't. That's not why I'm glad to see you. It's for something quite, quite different. I want to say something to you, and it's most important. Can't we just keep back a little from the others? I don't want Maggie to hear." Now why were Miss Oliphant's ears so sharp that afternoon? Why, even in the midst of her gay chatter to Constance, did she hear every word of Priscilla's queer, garbled speech? And why did astonishment and even anger steal into her heart? What she did, however, was to gratify Prissie immensely by hurrying on with her companion, so that she and Hammond were left comfortably in the background. "I don't quite know what you mean," he said, stiffly. "What can you possibly have of importance to say to me?" "I don't want Maggie to hear," repeated Prissie, in her earnest voice. She knew far too little of the world to be in the least alarmed at Hammond's stately tones. "What I want to say is about Maggie, and yet it isn't." "About Miss Oliphant?" "Oh, yes, but she's Maggie to me. She's the dearest, the best--there's no one like her, no one. I didn't understand her at first, but now I know how noble she is. I had no idea until I knew Maggie that a person could have faults, and yet be noble. It's a new sort of experience to me." Prissie's eyes, in which even in her worst moments there always sat the soul of a far-reaching sort of intelligence, were shining now through tears. Hammond saw the tears, and the lovely expression in the eyes, and said to himself-- "Good heavens, could I ever have regarded that dear child as plain?" Aloud, he said, in a softened voice, "I'm awfully obliged to you for saying these sorts of things of Miss--Miss Oliphant, but you must know, at least you must guess, that I--I have thought them for myself long, long ago." "Yes, of course, I know that. But have you much faith? Do you keep to what you believe?" "This is a most extraordinary girl!" murmured Hammond. Then he said aloud, "I fail to understand you." They had now nearly reached the Marshalls' door. The other two were waiting for them. "It's this," said Prissie, clasping her hands hard, and speaking in her most emphatic and distressful way. "There are unkind things being said of Maggie, and there's one girl who is horrid to her--horrid! I want you not to believe a word that girl says." "What girl do you mean?" "You were walking with her just now." "Really, Miss Peel, you are the most extraordinary--" But Maggie Oliphant's clear, sweet voice interrupted them. "Had we not better come into the house?" she said. "The door has been open for quite half a minute." Poor Prissie rushed in first, covered with shame; Miss Field hastened after, to bear her company; and Hammond and Maggie brought up the rear. CHAPTER TWENTY. A PAINTER. The Marshalls were always at home to their friends on Friday afternoons, and there were already several guests in the beautiful, quaint old drawing-room when the quartette entered. Mrs Marshall, her white hair looking lovely under her soft lace cap, came forward to meet her visitors. Her kind eyes looked with appreciation and welcome at one and all. Blushing and shamefaced Prissie received a pleasant word of greeting, which seemed in some wonderful way to steady her nerves. Hammond and Maggie were received as special and very dear friends, and Helen Marshall, the old lady's pretty grand-daughter, rushed forward to embrace her particular friend, Constance Field. Maggie felt sore; she scarcely knew why. Her voice was bright, her eyes shining, her cheeks radiant in their rich and lovely bloom. But there was a quality in her voice which Hammond recognised--a certain ring which meant defiance, and which prophesied to those who knew her well that one of her bad half-hours was not very far off. Maggie seated herself near a girl who was a comparative stranger and began to talk. Hammond drew near, and made a third in the conversation. Maggie talked in the brilliant, somewhat reckless fashion which she occasionally adopted. Hammond listened, now and then uttered a short sentence, now and then was silent, with disapproval in his eyes. Maggie read their expression like a book. "He shall be angry with me," she said to herself. Her words became a little wilder. The sentiments she uttered were the reverse of those Hammond held. Soon a few old friends came up. They were jolly, merry, good-humoured girls, who were all prepared to look up to Maggie Oliphant, and to worship her beauty and cleverness if she would allow them. Maggie welcomed the girls with effusion, let them metaphorically sit at her feet, and proceeded to disenchant them as hard as she could. Some garbled accounts of the auction at St Benet's had reached them, and they were anxious to get a full report from Miss Oliphant. Did she not think it a scandalous sort of thing to have occurred? "Not at all," answered Maggie in her sweetest tones; "it was capital fun, I assure you." "Were you really there?" asked Miss Duncan, the eldest of the girls. "We heard it, of course, but could scarcely believe it possible." "Of course I was there," replied Maggie. "Whenever there is anything really amusing going on, I am always in the thick of it." "Well!" Emily Duncan looked at her sister Susan. Susan raised her brows. Hammond took a photograph from a table which stood near, and pretended to examine it. "Shall I tell you about the auction?" asked Maggie. "Oh, please, if you would be so kind. I suppose, as you were present, such a thing could not really lower the standard of the college?" These words came from Susan Duncan, who looked at Hammond as she spoke. She was his cousin, and very fond of him. "Please tell us about the auction," he said, looking full at Maggie. "I will," she replied, answering his gaze with a flash of repressed irritation. "The auction was splendid fun! One of our girls was in debt, and she had to sell her things. Oh, it was capital! I wish you could have seen her acting as her own auctioneer. Some of us were greedy, and wanted her best things. I was one of those. She sold a sealskin jacket, an expensive one, quite new. There is a legend in the college that eighty guineas were expended on it. Well, I bid for the sealskin, and it was knocked down to me for ten. It is a little too big for me, of course, but when it is cut to my figure, it will make a superb winter garment." Maggie was clothed now in velvet and sable; nothing could be richer than her attire; nothing more mocking than her words. "You were fortunate," said Susan Duncan. "You got your sealskin a great bargain. Didn't she, Geoffrey?" "I don't think so," replied Hammond. "Why not? Oh, do tell us why not," cried the sisters, eagerly. He bowed to them, laughed as lightly as Maggie would have done, and said, in a careless tone: "My reasons are complex, and too many to mention. I will only say now that what is objectionable to possess can never be a bargain to obtain. In my opinion, sealskin jackets are detestable." With these words he strode across the room, and seated himself with a sigh of relief by Priscilla's side. "What are you doing all by yourself?" he said, cheerfully. "Is no one attending to you? Are you always to be left like a poor little forsaken mouse in the background?" "I am not at all lonely," said Prissie. "I thought you hated to be alone." "I did, the other day, in that drawing-room; but not in this. People are all kind in this." "You are right. Our hostess is most genial and sympathetic." "And the guests are nice, too," said Prissie; "at least, they look nice." "Ay, but you must not be taken in by appearances. Some of them only look nice." "Do you mean?" began Prissie in her abrupt, anxious voice. Hammond took alarm. He remembered her peculiar outspokenness. "I don't mean anything," he said, hastily. "By the way, are you fond of pictures?" "I have scarcely ever seen any." "That does not matter. I know by your face that you can appreciate some pictures." "But, really, I know nothing of art." "Never mind. If the painter who paints knows _you_--" "The painter knows me? I have never seen an artist in my life." "Nevertheless, there are some artists in the world who have conceived of characters like yours. There are some good pictures in this house-- shall I show you one or two?" Prissie sprang to her feet. "You are most kind," she said, effusively. "I really don't know how to thank you." "You need not thank me at all; or, at any rate, not in such a loud voice, nor so impressively. Our neighbours will think I have bestowed half a kingdom upon you." Prissie blushed, and looked down. "Don't be shocked with me," said Hammond; "I can read your grateful heart. Come this way." They passed Maggie Oliphant and her two or three remaining satellites. Prissie looked at her with longing, and tripped awkwardly against her chair. Hammond walked past Maggie as if she did not exist to him. Maggie nodded affectionately to Priscilla, and followed the back of Hammond's head and shoulders with a supercilious, amused smile. Hammond opened the outer drawing-room door. "Where are we going?" asked Priscilla. "Are not the pictures here?" "Some are here, but the best are in the picture gallery--here to the left, and down these steps. Now, I'm going to introduce to you a new world." He pushed aside a heavy curtain, and Prissie found herself in a rather small room, lighted from the roof. It contained in all about six or eight pictures, each the work of a master. Hammond walked straight across the gallery to a picture which occupied a wall by itself at the further end. It represented a summer scene of deep repose. There was water in the foreground; in the back, tall forest trees in the fresh, rich foliage of June. Overhead was a sunset sky, its saffron and rosy tints reflected in the water below. The master who painted the picture was Corot. Hammond motioned Priscilla to sit down opposite to it. "There is summer," he said; "peace, absolute repose. You have not to go to it; it comes to you." He did not say any more, but walked away to look at another picture in a different part of the gallery. Prissie clasped her hands; all the agitation and eagerness went out of her face. She leant back in her chair. Her attitude partook of the quality of the picture, and became restful. Hammond did not disturb her for several moments. "I am going to show you something different now," he said, coming up to her almost with reluctance. "There is one sort of rest; I will now show you a higher. Here, stand so. The light falls well from this angle. Now, what do you see?" "I don't understand it," said Prissie, after a long, deep gaze. "Never mind, you see something. Tell me what you see." Priscilla looked again at the picture. "I see a woman," she said at last, in a slow, pained kind of voice. "I can't see her face very well, but I know by the way she lies back in that chair, that she is old, and dreadfully tired. Oh, yes, I know well that she is tired--see her hand stretched out there--her hand and her arm--how thin they are--how worn--and--" "Hard worked," interrupted Hammond. "Anyone can see by the attitude of that hand, by the starting veins and the wrinkles, that the woman has gone through a life of labour. Well, she does not occupy the whole of the picture. You see before you a tired-out worker. Don't be so unhappy about her. Look up a little higher in the picture. Observe for yourself that her toils are ended." "Who is that other figure?" said Priscilla. "A woman too, but young and strong. How glad she looks, and how kind. She is carrying a little child in her arms. Who is she? What does she mean?" "That woman, so grand and strong, represents Death, but not under the old metaphor. She comes with renewed life--the child is the type of that--she comes as a deliverer. See, she is touching that poor worn-out creature, who is so tired that she can scarcely hold her head up again. Death, with a new aspect, and a new grand strength in her face, is saying to this woman, `Come with me now to your rest. It is all over,' Death says: `all the trouble and perplexity and strife. Come away with me and rest.' The name of that picture is `The Deliverer.' It is the work of a painter who can preach a sermon, write a book, deliver an oration, and sing a song, all through the medium of his brush. I won't trouble you with his name just now. You will hear plenty of him and his wonderful, great pictures by-and-by, if you love art as I do." "Thank you," said Prissie, simply. Some tears stole down her cheeks. She did not know she was crying; she did not attempt to wipe them away. CHAPTER TWENTY ONE. "I DETEST IT." Shortly after the girls got home that evening, they received letters in their rooms to inform them that Miss Heath and Miss Eccleston had come to the resolution not to report the affair of the auction to the college authorities. They would trust to the honour of the students at St Benet's not to allow such a proceeding to occur again, and would say nothing further on the matter. Prissie's eyes filled again with tears as she read the carefully worded note. Holding it open in her hand she rushed to Maggie's room and knocked. To her surprise, instead of the usual cheerful "Come in," with which Miss Oliphant always assured her young friend of a welcome, Maggie said from the other side of the locked door-- "I am very busy just now--I cannot see anyone." Priscilla felt a curious sense of being chilled; her whole afternoon had been one of elation, and Maggie's words came as a kind of cold _douche_. She went back to her room, tried not to mind, and occupied herself looking over her beloved Greek until the dinner-gong sounded. After dinner Priscilla again looked with anxious, loving eyes at Maggie. Maggie did not stop, as was her custom, to say a kind word or two as she passed. She was talking to another girl, and laughing gaily. Her dress was as picturesque as her face and figure were beautiful. But was Priscilla mistaken, or was her anxious observation too close? She felt sure as Miss Oliphant brushed past her that her eyelids were slightly reddened, as if she had been weeping. Prissie put out a timid hand and touched Maggie on the arm. She turned abruptly. "I forgot," she said to her companion. "Please wait for me outside, Hester; I'll join you in a moment, I have just a word to say to Miss Peel. What is it, Prissie?" said Maggie, then, when the other girl had walked out of hearing. "Why did you touch me?" "Oh, for nothing much," replied Prissie, half frightened at her manner, which was sweet enough, but had an intangible hardness about it, which Priscilla felt, but could not fathom. "I thought you'd be so glad about the decision Miss Heath and Miss Eccleston have come to." "No, I am not particularly glad. I can't stay now to talk it over, however; Hester Stuart wants, me to practise a duet with her." "May I come to your room later on, Maggie?" "Not to-night, I think; I shall be very busy." Miss Oliphant nodded brightly, and disappeared out of the dining-hall. Two girls were standing not far off. They had watched this little scene, and they now observed that Prissie clasped her hands, and that a woe-begone expression crossed her face. "The spell is beginning to work," whispered one to the other. "When the knight proves unfaithful the most gracious lady must suffer resentment." Priscilla did not hear these words. She went slowly upstairs and back to her own room, where she wrote letters home, and made copious notes from her last lectures, and tried not to think of the little cloud which seemed to have come between her and Maggie. Late, on that same evening, Polly Singleton, who had just been entertaining a chosen bevy of friends in her own room, after the last had bidden her an affectionate "Good-night," was startled at hearing a low knock at her door. She opened it at once. Miss Oliphant stood without. "May I come in?" she asked. "Why, of course. I'm delighted to see you. How kind of you to come. Where will you sit? I'm afraid you won't find things very comfortable, for most of my furniture is gone. But there's the bed; do you mind sitting on the bed?" "If I want to sit at all the bed is as snug a place as any," replied Maggie. "But I'm not going to stay a moment, for it is very late. See, I have brought you this back." Polly looked, and for the first time observed that her own sealskin jacket hung on Maggie's arm. "What do you mean?" she said. "My sealskin jacket! Oh, my beauty! But it isn't mine, it's yours now. Why do you worry me--showing it to me again?" "I don't want to worry you, Miss Singleton. I mean what I say. I have brought your jacket back." "But it is yours--you bought it." "I gave a nominal price for it, but that doesn't make it mine. Anyhow, I have no use for it. Please take it back again." Poor Polly blushed very red all over her face. "I wish I could," she said. "If there has been anything I regretted in the auction, besides getting all you girls into a mess, it has been my sealskin jacket. Dad is almost certain to ask me about it, for he never made me such a handsome present before. Poor dad! he was so proud the night he brought it home. He said, `Look here, Poll, I paid a whole sheaf of fivers for this, and although it cost me a good round eighty guineas, I'm told it's cheap at the price. Put it on, and let me see how you look in it,' he said. And when I had it on he twisted me round, and chucked me under the chin, and said I was `a bouncer.' Poor old dad! He was as proud as Punch of me in that jacket I never saw anything like it." "Well, he can be as proud as Punch of you again. Here is the jacket for your very own once more. Good-night." She walked to the door, but Miss Singleton ran after her. "I can't take it back," she said. "I'm not as mean as all that comes to. It's yours now; you got it as fair as possible." "Listen, Miss Singleton," said Maggie. "If I keep that jacket I shall never wear it. I detest sealskin jackets. It won't be the least scrap of use to me." "You detest sealskin jackets? How can you? Oh, the lovely things they are. Let me stroke the beauty down." "Stroke your beauty, and pet it as much as you like, only let me say `Good-night,' now." "But, please, Miss Oliphant, please, I'd do anything in the world to get the jacket back, of course. But I've ten guineas of yours, and honestly, I can't pay them back." "Allow me to lend them to you until next term. You can return me the money then, can you not?" Polly's face became on the instant a show of shining eyes, gleaming white teeth, and glowing cheeks. "Of course I could pay you back, you--_darling_," she said with enthusiasm. "Oh, what a relief this is to me; I'd have done anything in all the world to have my jacket back again." "It's a bargain, then. Good-night, Miss Singleton." Maggie tossed the jacket on Polly's bed, touched her hand lightly with one of her own, and left the room. She went quickly back to her own pretty sitting-room, locked her door, threw herself on her knees by her bureau, and sobbed long and passionately. During the few days which now remained before the end of the term no one quite knew what was wrong with Miss Oliphant. She worked hard in preparation for her lectures, and when seen in public was always very merry. But there was a certain hardness about her mirth which her best friends detected, and which caused Nancy Banister a good deal of puzzled pain. Priscilla was treated very kindly by Maggie; she still helped her willingly with her Greek, and even invited her into her room once or twice. But all the little half-beginnings of confidence which, now and then, used to burst from Maggie's lips, the allusions to old times, the sentences which revealed deep thoughts and high aspirations, all these, which made the essence of true friendship, vanished out of her conversation. Priscilla said to herself over and over that there was really no difference--that Miss Oliphant was still as kind to her, as valued a friend as ever--but in her heart she knew that this was not the case. Maggie startled all her friends by making one request. Might they postpone the acting of _The Princess_ until the middle of the following term? "I cannot do it justice now," she said. "I cannot throw my heart and soul into my part. If you act the play now you must allow me to withdraw." The other girls, Constance Field in particular, were astonished. They even felt resentful. All arrangements had been made for this especial play. Maggie was to be the Princess herself; no one could possibly take her place. It was most unreasonable of her to withdraw now. But it was one of the facts well-known at St Benet's that, fascinating as Miss Oliphant was, she was also unreasonable. On certain occasions she could even be disobliging. In short, when Maggie "took the bit between her teeth," to employ an old metaphor, she could neither be led nor driven. After a great deal of heated discussion and indignant words, she had her will. The play was deferred till the following term, and one or two slight comedies, which had been acted before, were revived in a hurry to take its place. CHAPTER TWENTY TWO. A BLACK SATIN JACKET. Very active preparations were being made in a certain rather humble little cottage in the country for the heroine's return. Three small girls were making themselves busy with holly and ivy, with badly-cut paper flowers, with enormous texts coarsely illustrated, to render the home gay and festive in its greeting. A little worn old woman lay on a sofa, and superintended these active measures. "How soon will she be here now?" said Hattie the vigorous. "Do stay still, Hattie, and don't fidget. Don't you see how tired Aunt Raby looks?" exclaimed Rose. "Prissie can't be here yet, and you are such a worry when you jump up and down like that, Hattie." Rose's words were quite severe, and Hattie planted herself on the edge of a chair, folded her plump hands, managed to get a demure look into her laughing eyes and dimpled mouth, and sat motionless for about half a minute. At the end of that time she tumbled on the floor with a loud crash, and Aunt Raby sprang to her feet with some alarm. "Good gracious, child! are you hurt? What's the matter?" Hattie was sitting on the floor in convulsions of mirth. "I'm not hurt," she exclaimed. "I slipped off the chair. I didn't mean to; I couldn't help it, really. I'm sorry I woke you, Aunt Raby." "I wasn't asleep, child." Miss Peel walked across the room, and vanished into the kitchen, from which very savoury smells issued. Hattie and Rose began to quarrel and argue, and Katie, who was more or less of a little peacemaker, suggested that they should draw up the blind, and all three get into the window to watch for Prissie. "I wonder how she will look?" said Rose, when they were all comfortably established. "I hope she won't talk in Latin," exclaimed Hattie. "Oh, it is nice to think of seeing Prissie so soon," murmured Katie in an ecstasy. "I wonder," began Rose in her practical voice, "how soon Prissie will begin to earn money. We want money even more than when she went away. Aunt Raby isn't as well as she was then, and since the cows were sold--" "Hush!" said Hattie. "You know we promised we wouldn't tell Prissie about the cows." Just then a distant sound of wheels was heard. The little girls began to jump and shout; a moment later and Priscilla stood in the midst of her family. A great excitement followed her arrival. There were kisses and hugs, and wild, rapturous words from the affectionate little sisters. Aunt Raby put her arms round Priscilla, and gave her a solemn sort of kiss, and then the whole party adjourned into the supper-room. The feast which was spread was so dainty and abundant that Katie asked in a puzzled sort of way if Aunt Raby considered Prissie like the Prodigal Son. "What fancies you have, child!" said Aunt Raby. "The Prodigal Son, indeed! Thank Heaven, I've never had to do with that sort! As to Priscilla here, she's as steady as Old Time. Well, child, and are you getting up your learning very fast?" "Pretty well, Aunt Raby." "And you like your grand college, and all those fine young-lady friends of yours?" "I haven't any fine young-lady friends." "H'm! I daresay they are like other girls; a little bit of learning, and a great deal of dress, eh?" Priscilla coloured. "There are all sorts of girls at St Benet's," she said after a pause. "Some are real students, earnest, devoted to their work." "Have you earned any money yet, Prissie?" exclaimed Hattie. "For if you have, I do want--look--" She thrust a small foot, encased in a broken shoe, prominently into view. "Hattie, go to bed this minute!" exclaimed Aunt Raby. "Go up to your room all three of you little girls. No more words--off at once, all of you. Prissie, you and I will go into the drawing-room, and I'll lie on the sofa, while you tell me a little bit about your college life." "Aunt Raby always lies oh the sofa in the evenings now," burst from Hattie the irrepressible. Miss Peel rushed after the plump little girl, and pushed her out of the room. "To bed, all of you!" she exclaimed. "To bed, and to sleep! Now, Prissie, you are not to mind a word that child says. Come into the drawing-room, and let us have a few words quietly. Oh, yes, I'll lie on the sofa, my dear, if you wish it. But Hattie is wrong; I don't do it every night. I suffer no pain either, Prissie. Many a woman of my age is racked with rheumatics." The last words were said with a little gasp. The elder woman lay back on the sofa, with a sigh of relief. She turned her face so that the light from the lamp should not reveal the deathly tired lines round it. Aunt Raby was dressed in a rough homespun garment. Her feet were clad in unbleached cotton stockings, also made at home; her little, iron-grey curls lay flat at each side of her hollow cheeks. She wore list slippers, very coarse and common in texture. Her whole appearance was the essence of the homely, the old-fashioned, even the ungainly. Priscilla had seen elegance and beauty since she went away; she had entered into the life of the cultivated, the intellectually great. In spite of her deep affection for Aunt Raby, she came back to the ugliness and the sordid surroundings of home with a pang which she hated herself for feeling. She forgot Aunt Raby's sufferings for a moment in her uncouthness. She longed to shower riches, refinement, beauty upon her. "How has your dress worn, Prissie?" said the elder woman, after a pause. "My sakes, child, you have got your best brown cashmere on! A beautiful fine bit of cashmere it was, too. I bought it out of the money I got for the lambs' wool." Aunt Raby stretched out her hand, and, taking up a fold of the cashmere, she rubbed it softly between her finger and thumb. "It's as fine as velvet," she said, "and I put strong work into it, too. It isn't a bit worn, is it, Prissie?" "No, Aunt Raby, except just round the tail. I got it very wet one day, and the colour went a trifle; but nothing to signify." A vivid picture rose up before Priscilla's eyes as she spoke of Mrs Elliot-Smith's drawing-room, and the dainty, disdainful ladies in their gay attire, and her own poor, little, forlorn figure in her muddy cashmere dress--the same dress Aunt Raby considered soft and beautiful as velvet. "Oh, Aunt Raby," she said with sudden impulse, "a great many things have happened to me since I went away. On the whole I have had a very good time." Aunt Raby opened her mouth to emit a prodigious yawn. "I don't know how it is," she said, "but I'm a bit drowsy to-night. I suppose it's the weather. The day was quite a muggy one. I'll hear your news another time, Priscilla; but don't you be turned with the vanities of the world, Priscilla. Life's but a passing day: you mind that when you're young, and it won't come on you as a shock when you are old. I'm glad the cashmere has worn well--ay, that I am, Prissie. But don't put it on in the morning, my love, for it's a sin to wear through beautiful fine stuff like that. And, even if the colour is gone a bit round the hem, the stuff itself isn't worn, and looks don't signify. You'll have to make up your mind to wear the cashmere for best again next term, Prissie, for, though I'm not pinched in any way, I'm not overflush either, my love." Priscilla, who had been sitting in a low chair near her aunt, now rose to her feet. "Ought we not to come to bed?" she said. "If you don't feel tired, you look it, Aunt Raby. Come upstairs, do, and let me help you to take your things off, and put you into bed. Come, Aunt Raby, it will be like old times to help you, you know." The girl knelt by the old woman, took one of her withered hands, raised it suddenly to her lips, and kissed it. Aunt Raby's face was still turned from the light. "Don't you keep kneeling on your cashmere," she said. "You'll crease it awfully, and I don't see my way to another best dress this term." "You needn't, Aunt Raby," said Priscilla, in a steady voice. "The cashmere is quite neat still. I can manage well with it." Aunt Raby rose slowly and feebly from the sofa. "You may help me to get into bed if you like," she said. "The muggy day has made me wonderfully drowsy, and I'll be glad to lie down. It's only that: I'll be as pert as a cricket in the morning." The old woman leant on the girl's strong, young arm, and stumbled a bit as she went up the narrow stairs. When they entered the tiny bedroom Aunt Raby spoke again-- "Your dress will do, but I have been fretting about your winter jacket, Prissie. There's my best one, though--you know, the quilted satin which my mother left me; its loose and full, and you shall have it." "But you want it to go to church in yourself, Aunt Raby." "I don't often go to church lately, child. I take a power of comfort lying on the sofa, reading my Bible, and Mr Hayes doesn't see anything contrary to Scripture in it, for I asked him. Yes, you shall have my quilted satin jacket to take back to college with you, Prissie, and then you'll be set up fine." Priscilla bent forward and kissed Aunt Raby. She made no other response, but that night before she went to sleep she saw distinctly a vision of herself. Prissie was as little vain as a girl could be, but the vision of her own figure in Aunt Raby's black satin quilted jacket was not a particularly inspiriting one. That jacket, full in the skirts, long in the shoulders, wide in the sleeves, and enormous round the neck, would scarcely bear comparison with the neat, tight-fitting garments which the “First page; and again, under Kampfmuller’s sign’ture, on the sporting page. We’ve got a good start, all right. Now----” “If it isn’t too late,” said Dan hesitantly, “I kind of wish you’d cancel the match. I don’t honest think I c’n stop Kid Feltman; for all you say I’ve gone ahead this half year. And it’s more’n an even bet he c’n stop me inside the limit. So I’ve been thinking it over, and I guess you’d best call it off; or get ’em to subst’toot some easier guy than Felt----” “Good Lord!” snorted Keegan. “Do you set there and tell me you don’t even remember from yesterday the layout for that fight? Of all the----” “Yep,” answered Rorke, sullenly playing with his food and glancing down for encouragement at the collie lying on the floor beside him. “Yep. I remember it all right, all right, Red. I remember it. But it won’t work. That’s why I----” “Won’t _work_?” thundered Keegan, glaring across at his embarrassed star. “Why the blue hell won’t it work? It’s the prettiest set-up we’ve ever handled. There ain’t a flaw to it. Won’t work, hey? Why the----” “Because,” replied Dan sheepishly, yet firm as stone, as he glowered back at his manager, “because that set-up of yours calls for a heap of fancy fouling. And--and I’m--I’m off fouling. Off it for keeps. That’s----” Red Keegan broke in on the halting announcement with a sound that a turkey might have produced had its tail feathers been pulled violently at the moment it chanced to be gobbling. The result was a noise that brought Jeff to his feet with a jump; his tulip ears cocked, his eyes aglow with excited inquiry; a series of staccato barks racketing from his furry throat. “Lay down, Jeffie!” ordered Dan. “He ain’t going to bite me. He’s only----” “Are you plumb crazy, Dan?” sputtered the manager. “Or is it a bum little joke? Off fouling, hey? What’s going to keep you from the hungry house if----” “If clean scrapping won’t keep me fed,” answered Rorke, “I’ll go get back my job in the puddling gang. Anyhow, it goes like I said. I’m off fouling. Now go ahead and swear!” But Red Keegan did not go ahead and swear. Profanity was a very present help to the nerves, in the event of stepping on a tack or mashing one’s thumb with a hammer or on hearing that one’s wife had eloped. But this matter lay too deep for swearing. Blusteringly, then flatteringly, then coaxingly and at last with the tremolo stop pulled far out, he pleaded with Dan. He painted in glowing colours the middleweight’s comfortable rise from the ranks and the golden future that awaited him under Keegan’s guidance, if only he would have the intelligence to stick to his manager’s tuition and not get fool ideas that he could fight on the square well enough to keep himself warm. He foretold a future of failure and gutter poverty should the fool hold to this suicidal new plan. To all of which Dan Rorke answered not a word; but sat glumly frowning at the spotty tablecloth and occasionally letting his fidgety hand rest for a second on Jeff’s head. When at last Keegan had run down and was bereft equally of breath and vocabulary and emotion, Dan began to speak. He did not look at the puffingly apoplectic manager, but rambled on as if addressing the hole in his napkin. “A feller told me once,” he began, “that there’s mighty little a collie dog don’t know. And I’ve seen enough of Jeff, here, to find out that’s so. Jeff c’n tell when I’m blue and when I’m tickled, just by looking at me. It--it’d be funny, wouldn’t it, if he c’d get to telling, by looking at me, that I’m not on the square? A dog with Jeff’s breeding and Jeff’s sense would sure be too high-toned to pal with a crook, if he knowed it. And he knows a lot of things I’d never s’posed a animal c’d know.” He looked down again at the collie as if for moral support. At the worry in his master’s glance, Jeff’s dark eyes took on a glint of eager concern. He laid one white little forepaw on Dan’s muddy boot, and whined softly, far down in his throat. Thus encouraged, Rorke went on: “That’s only one end of it. Here’s another: A man’s pretty low down in the list, ain’t he, if he can’t even fight as square as his dog c’n fight? A clean dog’s sure got a right to a clean master. Them folks yesterday was all praising Jeff. They wasn’t praising him so much for licking the big feller as for licking him, _clean_; and for not fouling when he had a chance to. I c’d see that myself. Well, I sh’d think folks would feel that way about a man that fights clean. Anyhow,” he finished defiantly, “no poor dog’s going to have the right to say he’s a whiter man than what I am. I been thinking it all over. And that’s the answer. I’m off fouling. Like I said.” For the next twenty-four hours the bungalow and the gym were vibrant with the sounds of argument and vituperation. Keegan exhausted his every battery. And--like most men who think slowly and seldom--Dan Rorke grew more and more firmly set in his queer resolution, the more he discussed it. Even stolid Bud Curly, his sparring partner and general handy man round the gym, was moved to bewilderment by the once-docile fighter’s firmness in resisting the all-powerful boss. Only once, in a day and night of abusive exhortation on Red’s part, did Dan lose for an instant his sullen calm. That was when Keegan grumbled: “It’s all the damn’ dog’s fault. It’s him that’s turned you loony. I’ve got a good mind to shoot him. Then maybe you’ll----” “You shoot that dog,” flared Rorke, striding up to the little manager, his thick fingers working convulsively, “and, by the good Lord, I swear I’ll break your neck over my knee; if I go to the chair for it. That goes for _you_, too, Curly! If you think I’m bluffing, you’d best change your mind--unless you’re sick of staying alive. It goes!” To Bud Curly’s surprise the irascible Red did not retort. Instead, he stood looking long and earnestly at the raging fighter. Then he said with conciliatory calm: “Nobody wants to hurt the purp, Dan. Climb down off the ceiling. And if you’re so dead set on playing the fool--well, I s’pose I’ll have to trail my bets along with yours. You can’t lick Feltman on the square. But it won’t be my fault if you don’t put up the best fight of your life ag’in him. It’s too late to cancel the match now. All me and Curly c’n do is to train you to the minute and trust to luck for the rest.” Glad to have won his sorry point, Dan settled down with grim energy to the task of training. He knew how slight were his chances of victory. Yet he was ready to meet the suddenly reconciled Keegan halfway, by training at his level best. Feltman and a little retinue came to Pitvale, in order to be on the ground, and to avoid travel before the fight. They set up training quarters scarce two blocks away from Keegan’s bungalow. For nearly a month the two rivals wrought at their preparations for the battle. Once or twice on hike or sprint they chanced to meet in street or highroad. And such well-rehearsed chance meetings, with their mutual scowling frigidity, served Kampfmuller as splendid “grudge-fight” copy for the _Chronicle_. The fight was to be held in the Pitvale Coliseum, a vast and barnlike structure originally built for state conventions and for summer Chautauqua lectures. It was scheduled for ten o’clock on the night of April second. On the morning of April second Dan Rorke awoke from a ten-hour sleep, ran under the shower, rubbed down, slipped into his clothes, and started for breakfast with the appetite of a longshoreman. His nerves as well as his physique had profited by his hard and wise training. If he was due to end the day in defeat, at least the thought of it had not marred his night’s rest or his appetite. Outside his bedroom door he paused as usual for his morning frolic with Jeff. But Jeff was not there. In all their long months of chumship this was the first morning that Jeff had not been on hand to greet with noisy delight his new-awakened master. And the dog’s absence perplexed Rorke. Downstairs he went, hoping to find the collie waiting for him in the dining-room. The room was empty. Whistling for the missing Jeff, Dan went out on the tiny front porch. No dog was in view. But he saw Keegan and Bud working with scrambly haste at a far end of the yard, piling shovelfuls of fresh dirt into what looked like a new-dug hole under the yard’s one fruit tree. Before Dan could call out, Curly happened to look up from his toil; and caught sight of him as he stood on the porch steps. Curly nudged Keegan and said something out of the corner of his mouth. The two exchanged nervous whispers; then Red dropped his spade and came hurrying towards the house, a labouredly artificial smile of greeting on his bothered face. “Seen Jeff, anywhere?” asked Rorke, his puzzled eyes still on Curly, who was now patting the crumbly earth smooth over the filled excavation. “Sure, I’ve seen him!” babbled Keegan with forced joviality, and looking anywhere rather than at Dan. “He was frisking round here just a minute ago. Must ‘a’ run down street, a ways. He’ll be back soon. Come on in and eat! Sleep all right? I wasn’t expecting you down for another ten minutes.” He had mounted the steps and almost forcibly was propelling Dan indoors. “Looking for Jeff?” hollowly queried Bud Curly, coming up the steps behind him. “He’s all right. Good old Jeff’s all right. He was playing round in the gym just now.” Dan Rorke was the least subtle of men; and his brain was too small to hold suspicion. But a five-year-old child would have been keenly aware of the guilt and furtiveness in the manner of the two. Dan stopped short. He looked from one to the other of them; then at the fresh earth under the fruit tree. “Red, you told me Jeff went down street!” he accused. “And now Bud says he’s out in the gym. Which of you is lying? And why is either of you lying? And what were you burying out there? Speak up, one of you; or I’ll go there and dig till I find out!” He spoke with rising excitement. As he finished he made as if to start across the yard towards the tree. Both men seized him and both began speaking at once. “Jeff’s all right!” insisted Red. “And we was just spading up the earth to make that tree grow better. It’s too spindly. And----” “Yes,” declared Bud in the same breath, “Jeff’s feeling fine. He’ll be back pres’n’ly. We was trying to see could we bury some garbage out yonder, ’stead of bothering to burn it. We----” “Jeff is dead!” interrupted Dan, his voice all at once lifeless and flat. “You been burying him. You don’t want me to know. He----” The two others fidgeted guiltily. Then, clearing his throat, Keegan said: “I wanted to keep it from you, till after to-night, Danny. I’m sorry. Sorry, right down to the ground. But since you’ve guessed that much of it I’d best tell you the whole thing. Buck up and take it like a he-man, son. After all, he was only just a dog. I’ll buy you another one and----” “There ain’t any other one!” denied Rorke chokingly. “There was only just Jeff! Him and me. And he was the chum I-- What happened to him?” he demanded fiercely, swallowing very hard and trying to keep his voice steady and his eyes dry. “Spill it!” “Then take it!” cried Keegan harshly. “Take it straight, like a he-man had ought to take rotten news. This morning, when I went apast your door, there lay Jeff. He was stone-dead. I picked him up and brang him down on the porch. I knowed how it’d queer your nerve to find out he was gone. So I aimed to bury him and tell you he’d just strayed off, like; and that he would come home by and by. When I got him out on the porch I noticed he was all strained backward. And I’d seen dogs poisoned by strychnia before. There ain’t any other poison that makes ’em look that way. He----” “Poisoned!” yelled Dan in blind fury, catching at the word. “I’ll find the swine that did it, if it takes every cent I got. And when I once get hold of him----” “I beat you to it, Danny,” continued Red’s sorrowing tones. “I got Curly, here, to start digging a grave; and I piked down to Reuter’s drug store. I had a sneaking s’spicion, already. Reuter was just opening up for the day when I got there. I asked him who had bought strychnia of him lately. The only strychnia he’s sold in the past week was what he sold to a man yesterday; a feller who had a doctor’s p’scription for it, and said he wanted it to poison cats that kep’ him awake by yowling under his window. He got Reuter to tell him how to fix it up in a piece of meat----” “Who was he?” broke in Rorke, his eyeteeth showing, his deep voice a half-coherent growl. “Who----” “The doctor that gave the man the p’scription,” said Keegan slowly, “was that old down-and-out M. D. slob that Feltman has for a handy man. The feller that bought the poison and asked Reuter how to fix it was--Kid Feltman. He----” The manager got no further. Dan Rorke was out of the door and down the steps at one bound. It was only as he stopped to yank madly at the gate latch that Red and Curly overtook him and threw themselves bodily on the raging man. Even then it was a matter of minutes before their combined strength and Bud’s wrestling grip, from behind, could quell him. “Let me go!” he snarled, straining and biting at the detaining arms. “I’ll settle with him before Jeff’s cold! I’ll----” “You’ll settle with him a heap better’n by trying to beat him up now, with his handlers and them to keep you from doing it,” promised Keegan. “There’s better ways. Lots better ways. You listen to me, Danny boy!” Momentarily spent with his own fury, Rorke suffered himself to be dragged indoors. There Keegan faced him and said: “You want to square yourself with Feltman--and more’n square yourself? Good. Then here’s the way: Feltman’s always hated you, ever since he lost to you that time. He’s told fifty folks he’d get even. He’s seen, and he’s heard, how much store you set by Jeff. So he poisoned him to get back at you. Now here’s how you’ll get back at _him_: You was going to fight him clean. And he’d ‘a’ most likely won. So that ain’t the way to fight him, if you want to settle with him for poor Jeff. The way to do is to sail in with every foul that can git past Kampfmuller. And a hay load of ’em c’n git past that ivory mine. Foul him from the start, with the murderingest set of fouls I’ve ever learned you. Cripple him so he’ll be in the hosp’tal a year. Foul him into a dead one; and then punch his head off’n him and win as early in the fight as you want to. Git the idee? Foul him to death if you like. It’s no worse’n he treated Jeff. The ring’s the place to finish him. Not now, where you’d likely land up in the hoosgow before you’d more’n half hit him. Go to it!” Dan grunted avid assent. And after breakfast careful rehearsing of old foul tactics and a study of new ones began. As Dan Rorke, stripped and eager, sat in his hot dressing room under the auditorium that night, waiting for the summons to enter the ring, he had his first minute of solitary reflection throughout the whole Keegan-infested day. His manager was upstairs, wrangling with the carnival treasurer. Curly had gone to the ring to watch the wind-up of the second preliminary bout. Dan was alone. In his heart still raged black hate and a craving for revenge. And he was sick with grief over his chum’s murder. While he sat there, the faint challenge bark of a dog--a collie, perhaps--from nowhere in particular, drifted to him through the ill-boarded dressing-room walls. At the sound Dan started violently. “_Jeff?_” he whispered under his breath. As if in answer to his call, the room all at once seemed athrob with the presence of his loved dog. In superstitious awe Dan peered about him. Then he straightened his bent body. And to an unseen Something he began to speak. “We’re going to pay up the bill in a few minutes now, Jeffie!” he promised. “Watch me!” The foolish words started a new train of thoughts in the tormented brain. Watch him? The clean-fighting dog watch his master put up the foulest fight of his career? With the vision came sharp revulsion. “Watch me, Jeff!” he repeated aloud. “Watch me do it! Watch me do it, square! _Square_, Jeffie, boy!” While the odd exaltation was still upon him Keegan and Curly came back to the dressing room to escort him to the arena. The Pitvale Athletic Carnival crowd that night witnessed the bloodiest and most spectacularly ferocious battle in the annals of the local ring. From the sound of the gong Dan Rorke was at his antagonist, forcing the fight at every point. Never once for the fraction of a second did he abandon the aggressive. Feltman showered upon him an avalanche of scientific punishment. But it failed to slow down that homicidal attack. To Red Keegan’s goggle-eyed dismay and despite his dumfounded inter-round pleas, Rorke fought as clean as a Galahad. Not once would he make use of even the safest foul. Not once would he seek to elude the dull referee by using the easiest of Keegan’s carefully taught ruses. He fought like a wild beast, but he fought like a fair one. Buoyed up by his insane hate for his enemy and by his stark craving for vengeance, he was as a man in delirium. The hideous punishment meted out to him had no visible effect on his maniac strength or speed. His madness did not preclude the use of all the skill he could muster, but it made him impervious to pain and to shock. Round after round the fight slashed on, while the crowd screamed and pounded in delight and while Red Keegan and Curly watched their madman with anguished eyes. Willing to take the heaviest blow, if only he might land as heavy a smash in return, Dan tore away at his foe. Four times he was knocked down. Once he was unconscious for five seconds. But borne ever onward by that wild urge of revenge he came flying back to the combat with undiminished fury. Flesh and blood could not stand the fearful tax indefinitely. Through all his mania Rorke began dimly to realise that there was a trifle less crushing vehemence in his own punches and less whirlwind speed in his onslaught. With every atom of will and of rage and of resolve in his whole cosmos, he scourged himself to renewed effort. The welter of blows avalanched upon him, unfelt. Over and over in his hot brain he was saying: “Watch me do it, Jeff! Watch me do it, _square_!” And he fought on. As Dan reeled back to his corner at the end of the hammer-and-tongs ninth round he heard, as from miles off, Keegan’s voice whispering to him: “Try out the good old stunts, Danny! ’Tain’t too late, even yet. He’s groggy. Try ’em. Curly tells me he’s making a joke of how he killed Jeff. Says he kicked the poor purp yesterday, too, when he met him in the street. He----” Dan heard no more. The minute’s rest was over almost before it began. His ears ringing with the tale of the kick, he plunged back into the fight. Feltman met him in midring; a horribly battered and staggering Feltman, who sought to improve on his minute’s rest by feinting with the left and then aiming a great right swing for the head. The swing did not land. Disregarding the feint, Rorke had bored in. The swing passed beyond him, while his two fists were greedily busy with infighting at his tired adversary’s body. Across the ring and to the ropes, with all his ebbing force, he hammered Feltman. Against the ropes he drove him. Then, as Feltman rebounded from the impact, Dan flung every remaining sinew of strength into a cross-body right for the jaw. It was a reckless blow, except as a counter. And Feltman saw it coming in time. But his worn-out guard would not obey the dazed brain’s mandate quickly enough to block the mighty punch. Rorke’s rage-driven right fist caught his opponent flush on the point of the chin. And Feltman sprawled prone on his face. Quietly, non-dramatically, he lay there, dead to the world while the referee counted. At the count of eight Feltman tried instinctively to get up. But he succeeded only in rolling over on his back. Cut to ribbons, bleeding, bruised, aching and all but blinded, Dan Rorke suffered the exultant Keegan and Bud to guide him down to his dressing room. He had won. He had thrashed the man who had poisoned Jeff. This much his dizzy senses told him. But Feltman was still alive. And Jeff was dead. Dan’s heart was like cold lead beneath his bruised ribs. His sensational victory was as ashes and dust to him. He was deaf to Keegan’s hysterical adulation. Nothing mattered. Bud Curly swung open the dressing-room door. Over the threshold swept a whirlwind of gold and white, barking rapturously and flinging itself upon Rorke’s bleeding chest. (Long afterwards Dan listened with a foolish grin on his swollen face while Keegan confessed the truly Keeganesque trick whereby he had sought to lure back his man to an acceptance of the sure-to-win foul tactics; of the hiding of Jeff in a neighbour’s cellar for the day; and the spiriting of him into the dressing room after the fight began; of the coaching of Curly into indorsing the tale of poison and of Bud’s part in the mock grave digging,--a digging timed nicely to coincide with Dan’s appearance on the porch.) All this, much later. But, for the instant, the only thing Dan Rorke knew was that his dead pet--or its ghost, it did not matter which--had come back to him; and that everything was once more tremendously worth while and that the world was a gorgeous place to do one’s living in. Forgetful of hurts and of weakness, he gathered the ecstatically squirming collie into his battered bare arms and babbled sobbingly: “I did it, square, Jeff. I did it, square! You--you _saw_ me do it, SQUARE.” THE GRUDGE This is the strange yarn of three dogs. If the dogs had been humans, the story would have been on stage and screen long ago. Frayne’s Farms is the alliterative name for the hundred-acre tract of rich bottom land; in the shadow of the Ramapo Mountains,--a range that splits North Jersey’s farm country for some twenty odd miles. Back in these mountains are queer folk; whose exploits sometimes serve as a page story for some Sunday newspaper. Within forty miles of New York City as the crow flits, the handful of mountaineers are well-nigh as primitive as any South Sea Islanders. They are as a race apart; and with their own barbarous codes and customs. Down from the mountains in the starvingly barren winter time, every few years, a band of huge black mongrel dogs used to swoop upon the Valley, harrying it from end to end in search of food; and leaving a trail of ravaged henroosts and sheepfolds in their wake. These plunderers were the half-wild black dogs of the mountaineers;--dogs blended originally from a tangle of diverse breeds; hound predominating; and with a splash of wolf-blood in their rangy carcases. When famine and cold gripped the folk of the mountains, the dogs were deprived of even such scanty crusts and bones as were their summer portion. And, under the goad of hunger, the black brutes banded for a raid on the richer pickings of the Valley. At such times, every able-bodied farmer, from Trask Frayne to the members of the Italian garden-truck colony, up Suffern-way, would arm himself and join the hunt. Rounding up the horde of mongrels, they would shoot fast and unerringly. Such few members of the pack as managed to break through the cordon and make a dash for the mountains were followed hotly up into the fastnesses of the grey rocks and were exterminated by trained huntsmen. The mountaineers were too shrewd to make any effort to protect their sheep-slaying and chicken-stealing pets from the hunters. Much as they affected to despise the stolid toilers of the Valley, yet they had learned from more than one bitter and long bygone experience that the Valley men were not safe to trifle with when once righteous indignation drove them to the warpath. For years after such a battle, the Valley was wholly free from the marauding black-dog pack. Not only did the dogs seem to shun, by experience, the peril of invading the lowlands; but their numbers were so depleted that there was more than enough food for all of the few survivors, in the meagre garbage of the mountain shacks. Not until numbers and forgetfulness again joined hands with famine, did the pack renew its Valley forays. When this story begins, a mere two years had passed since the latest of the mongrel hunts. Forty farmers and hired men, marshalled and led by young Trask Frayne, had rounded up not less than seventy-five of the great black raiders at the bank of the frozen little Ramapo river, which winds along at the base of the mountain wall, dividing the Valley from the savage hinterland. The pack’s depredations had beaten all records, that season. And the farmers were grimly vengeful. Mercilessly, they had poured volley after volley into the milling swarm of freebooters. Led by a giant dog, ebony black and with the forequarters of a timber wolf, the handful of remaining pillagers had burst through the cordon and crossed the river to the safety of the bleak hills. It was Trask Frayne who guided the posse of trackers in pursuit. For the best part of two days the farmers kept up the hunt. An occasional far-off report of a shotgun would be wafted to the Valley below, in token of some quarry trailed to within buckshot range. The gaunt black giant leading the pack seemed to be invulnerable. No less than five times during that two-day pursuit some farmer caught momentary sight of him; only to miss aim by reason of the beast’s uncanny craftiness and speed. Trask Frayne himself was able to take a hurried shot at the ebony creature as the fugitive slunk shadowlike between two hillock boulders. At the report of Trask’s gun, the huge mongrel had whirled about, snarling and foaming at the mouth and had snapped savagely at his own shoulder; where a single buckshot had just seared a jagged groove. But, before Frayne could fire a second shot, the dog had vanished. Thus the hunt ended. Nearly all the black dogs of the mountaineers had met the death penalty. It was the most thorough and successful of the historic list of such battles. The raiders were practically exterminated. Many a year must pass before the pack could hope again to muster numbers for an invasion. And the Valley breathed easier. Yet, Trask Frayne was not content. He knew dog-nature, as it is given to few humans to know it. And he could not forget the wily black giant that had led the band of mongrels. The Black was a super-dog, for cunning and strength and elusiveness. That had been proven by certain ultra-devastating features of the raid; as well as by his own escape from the hunters. And the Black still lived;--still lived, and with no worse reminder of his flight than a bullet-cut on one mighty shoulder. Such a dog was a menace; so long as he should continue alive. Wherefore Trask Frayne wanted to kick himself for his own ill-luck in not killing him. And he was obsessed by a foreboding that the Valley had not seen the last of the Black. He could not explain this premonition. He could not explain it, even to himself. For Valley history showed that each battle served as a wholesome lesson to the black dogs for years thereafter. Never, between forays, was one of them seen on the hither side of the Ramapo. Yet the idea would not get out of Frayne’s head. Trask had hated the necessary job of destroying the mongrels. For he loved dogs. Nothing short of stark need would have lured him into shooting one of them. His own two thoroughbred collies, Tam-o’-Shanter and Wisp, were honoured members of the Frayne household. Dogs of the same breed differ as much in character as do humans of the same race. For example, no two humans could have been more widely divergent in nature than were these two collies of Trask’s. Tam-o’-Shanter was deep-chested, mighty of coat, tawny; as befitted the son of his illustrious sire, old Sunnybank Lad. Iron-firm of purpose and staunchly loyal to his master, Tam was as steady of soul as a rock. Whether guarding the farm-buildings or rounding up a bunch of scattered sheep that had broken bounds, he was calmly reliable. He adored Trask Frayne with a worship that was none the less all-absorbing because it was so undemonstrative. And he cared for nothing and nobody else on earth--except Wisp. Wisp had been the runt of a thoroughbred litter. He was slender and fragile and wholly lovable; a dainty little tricolour, scarce forty pounds in weight. Not strong enough for heavy work, yet Wisp was a gallant guard and a gaily affectionate house dog--the cherished pet and playfellow of the three Frayne babies. Also, he was Tam’s dearest friend. The larger collie, from puppyhood, had established a protection over Wisp; ever conceding to him the warmest corner of the winter hearth, the shadiest spot in the dooryard in summer, the best morsels of their joint daily meal. He would descend from his calm loftiness to romp with the frolicsome Wisp;--though the sight of stately Tam, trying to romp, was somehow suggestive of Marshal Joffre playing pat-a-cake. In short, he loved Wisp, as he loved not even Trask Frayne. More than once, in the village, when a stray cur misunderstood Wisp’s gay friendliness and showed his teeth at the frail little dog, Tam so far departed from his wonted noble dignity as to hurl himself upon the aggressor and thrash the luckless canine into howling submission. He was Wisp’s guardian, as well as his dearest comrade. Once in a very great while such inseparable friendships spring up between two collies. One morning in June, Trask set forth for Suffern with a flock of sixty sheep. The day was hot; and the journey promised to be tiresome. So, when the two collies had worked the sixty out from the rest of the Frayne bunch of sheep and had started them, bleating and milling, toward the highroad, Trask whistled Wisp back to him. “Home, boy!” he ordered, patting the friendly uplifted head and playfully rumpling the collie’s silken ears. “Back home, and take care of things there to-day. It’s a long hot trip for a pup that hasn’t any more stamina than you have, Wispy. Tam and I can handle them, all right. Chase back home!” The soft brown eyes of the collie filled with infinitely pathetic pleading. Wisp understood the meaning of his master’s words as well as might any of the Frayne children. From birth he had been talked to; and his quick brain had responded; as does every clever collie’s. Wisp knew he had been bidden to stay at home from this delightful outing. And every inch of his body as well as his eloquent eyes cried aloud in appeal to be taken along. Yet, when, once more, Frayne petted his head and pointed towards the dooryard, the good little chap turned obediently back. As he passed Tam, the two dogs touched noses; as if exchanging speech of some sort;--as perhaps they were. Then, disconsolately, Wisp trotted to the house and curled up on the doormat in a small and furry and miserably unhappy heap. There he was still lying, his sorrowful eyes fixed on his master and on his busily-herding chum; as the huddle of sheep were guided out of the gateway into the highroad beyond. Glancing back, Frayne smiled encouragingly at the pathetic little waiting figure at the door. Tam, too, paused, as he manœuvred the last silly sheep into the highroad; and stood beside Frayne, for a second, peering back at his chum. Under their momentary glance, Wisp made shift to wag his plumy tail once; by way of affectionate farewell. Long afterward, Trask Frayne could summon up memory of the daintily graceful little dog, lying so obediently on the doormat and wagging such a brave goodbye to the master who had just deprived him of a jolly day’s outing. Possibly the picture remained in Tam-o’-Shanter’s memory, too. It is to be hoped so. For never again were Frayne or Tam to see their lovable little collie chum. Dusk was sifting down the valley from beyond the mountain wall that afternoon, when Trask Frayne turned once more into the gateway leading to his farm. At his side trotted Tam. It had been a hard day, both for dog and man. At best, it is no light task to marshal a flock of sixty bolting sheep along miles of winding road. But when that road is infested with terrifying motor-cars and when it goes past two or three blast-emitting stone-quarries and a railway, the labour is spectacular in spots and arduous at all times. But, at last, thanks to Tam, the sheep had reached Suffern without a single mishap; and had been driven skilfully into the herd-pens. The seven-mile homeward tramp had been, by contrast, a mere pleasure-stroll. Yet, both the collie and his master were glad of the prospect of rest and of supper. Frayne, reviewing the labour of the day, was pleased with his own foresight in making Wisp stay at home. He knew such an ordeal, in such weather, would have tired the delicate collie half to death. Coming up the dusky lane from the house to meet the returning wanderers was a slender, white-clad woman. As he saw her, Frayne waved his hat and hurried forward at new speed. Thus, always, after one of his few absences from home, his pretty young wife came up the lane to welcome him. And, as ever, the sight of her made him forget his fatigue. Yet, now, after that first glance, worry took the place of eagerness, in Frayne’s mind. For his wife was advancing slowly and spiritlessly; and not in the very least with her wonted springy walk. “The heat’s been too much for her!” he muttered worriedly to Tam. “It’s been a broiling day. She ought to have----” But Tam was no longer beside him. The big collie had started ahead, toward the oncoming woman. Usually, when Mildred Frayne came thus to greet her returning husband, Wisp was with her. The little dog would bound ahead of his mistress, as Frayne appeared; and come galloping merrily up to him and Tam. Tam, too, always cantered forward to touch noses with his chum. But, by this evening’s dim light, Frayne could not see Wisp. Nor did Tam rush forward as usual. Instead, he was pacing slowly toward Mildred, with head and tail adroop. As Tam had turned in at the gate beside his master, the collie had come to a convulsive halt. His nostrils had gone upward in a series of eagerly suspicious sniffs. Then, his shaggy body had quivered all over, as if with a spasm of physical pain. At that moment, Mildred’s white-clad figure had caught his wandering eye. And he had moved forward, downcast and trembling, to meet her. It was Tam,--long before Trask,--who discovered that Mildred was weeping. And this phenomenon, for the instant, turned his attention from his vain search for Wisp and from the confusingly menacing scents which had just assailed his nostrils. Departing from his lifelong calm, the big dog whined softly, as he came up with Mildred; and he thrust his cold muzzle sympathisingly into her loose-hanging hand. Within him stirred all his splendid race’s pitiful yearning to comfort a human in grief. So poignant was this craving that it almost made him forget the increasingly keen scents which had put him on his guard when he came in through the gateway. “Hello!” called Trask, cheerily, as he neared his wife. “Tired, dear? You shouldn’t have bothered to walk all this way out to meet me. After a rotten day like this, you ought to be resting.... Where’s Wisp? Is he ‘disciplining’ me for making him stay home? I----” Then he, too, saw Mildred was crying. And before he could speak again, she had thrown her arms around his neck; and was sobbing out an incoherent story, broken by an occasional involuntary shiver. Holding her close to him and asking eagerly futile questions, Trask Frayne, bit by bit, drew forth the reason for her grief. Harry and Janet, the two older children, had gone down to the river, that noon, to fish, off the dock, for perch. Mildred, at an upper window where she was sewing, had watched them from time to time. For the river was high and rapid from recent rains. But Wisp was with them; and she had experience in the little collie’s sleepless care over the youngsters. More than once, indoors, Wisp had thrust his own slight body between a Frayne child and the fire. Again and again, at the dock, he had interposed his puny bulk and had shoved with all his force; when one or another of the babies ventured too close to the edge. To-day, as she looked up from her sewing, she had seen the trio leave the dock and start homeward. Janet had been in the lead; swinging the string of perch and sunfish and shiners they had caught. They had skirted a riverside thicket on their way to the home-path. Out from the bushes had sprung a gigantic lean dog, jet black except for a zig-zag patch of white on one shoulder. The wind had been strong in the other direction. So no scent of the dog had reached Wisp, who was dawdling along a bit to the rear of the children. The black had made a lightning grab at the carelessly swung string of fish; and had snatched them away from Janet. As he turned to bolt back into the thicket with his stolen feast, Harry had caught up a stick and had charged in pursuit of the string of laboriously-caught fish. The child had brought his stick down with a resounding thwack on the head of the escaping beast. The blow must have stung. For, instantly, the Black dropped the fish and leaped upon the tiny chap. All this in a single second or less. But, before the mongrel’s teeth could reach their mark, Wisp had flashed past the two startled children and had launched his weak body straight at the Black’s throat. Down went the two dogs in a tearing, snarling heap. Mildred, realising how hopelessly unequal was the contest, had run to the aid of her beloved Wisp. Fleeing downstairs, she had snatched Trask’s gun from its peg above the mantel, had seized at random a handful of shells; and ran out of the house and towards the river, loading the gun as she went. By the time she came in sight, the Black had already recovered the advantage he had lost by Wisp’s unexpected spring. By dint of strength and of weight, he had torn himself free of Wisp’s weak grip, had flung the lighter dog to earth and had pinned him there. Right gallantly did little Wisp battle in the viselike grasp of the giant. Fiercely he strove to bite at the rending jaws and to rip free from the crushing weight above him. But, as ever, mere courage could not atone for dearth of brute strength and ferocity. Undeterred by his foe’s puny efforts or by the fusillade of blows from Harry’s stick and from Janet’s pudgy fists, the Black had slung Wisp to one side and had lunged once more at him. This time he found the mark he sought:--the back of the neck, just below the base of the brain. He threw all his vast jaw-power into one terrific bite. And little Wisp’s frantic struggles ceased. The valiant collie lay inert and moveless; his neck broken. Maddened by conquest, the Black tossed the lifeless body in air. It came to ground on the edge of the river. There, from the momentum of the toss, it had rebounded into the water. The swift current had caught it and borne it downstream. Then, for the first time, the Black seemed to realise that both frantically screaming children were showering futile blows on him. With a snarl he turned on Harry. But, as he did so, Mildred’s flying feet brought her within range. Halting, she raised the gun and fired. She was a good shot. And excitement had not robbed her aim of steadiness. But excitement had made her catch up a handful of cartridges loaded lightly with Number Eight shot; instead of anything more deadly. The small pellets buzzed, hornetlike, about the Black’s head and shoulders; several of them stinging hotly. But at that distance, the birdshot could do no lasting damage. Nor did any of it chance to reach one of his eyes. With a yell of pain he wheeled to face the woman. And she let him have the second barrel. Memories of former clashes with gunners seemed to wake in the brute’s crafty brain. Snarling, snapping, shaking his tormented head, he turned and plunged into the narrow river; gaining the farther bank and diving into the waterside bushes before Mildred could think to reload. The balance of the day had been spent in a vain search of the bank, downstream, for Wisp’s lost body; and in trying to comfort the heart-broken children. Not until she had gotten the babies to bed and had soothed them to sleep did Mildred have scope to think of her own grief in the loss of the gentle dog who had been so dear to her. “He--he gave his life for them!” she finished her sobbing recital. “He knew,--he _must_ have known,--that he had no chance against that horrible monster. And Wisp had never fought, you know, from the day he was born. He knew that brute would kill him. And he never hesitated at all. He gave his life for the children. And--and we can’t--can’t even say a prayer over his grave!” But Trask Frayne, just then, was not thinking of prayers. Deep down in his throat, he was cursing:--softly, but with much venom. And the nails of his hard-clenched fists bit deep into his palms. “Black, with a white scar on the shoulder?” he said, at last, his own harsh voice not unlike a dog’s growl. “Hound ears, and the build of a timber-wolf? Almost as big as a Dane; and bone-thin? H’m! That’s my buckshot-scar on his shoulder,--that zig-zag white mark. To-morrow morning, I’m going hunting. Up in the mountains. Want to come along, Tam?” But, as before, Tam was not there, when his master turned to speak to him. The collie had waited only long enough to note that the task of comforting the weeping Mildred had been taken over by more expert powers than his. Then he had trotted off towards the house; not only to solve the problem of these sinister scents which hung so heavy on the moist night air, but to find his strangely-absent chum, Wisp. Circling the house, he caught Wisp’s trail. It was some hours old; but by no means too cold to be followed by a collie whose scenting powers had once tracked a lost sheep for five miles through a blizzard. With Wisp’s trail was mingled that of two of the children. And it led to the river-path. True, there were other trails of Wisp’s, that the sensitive nostrils caught. But all of them were older than this which led to the water. Therefore, as any tracking dog would have known, Wisp had gone riverward, since he had been near the house. And down the path, nose to ground, followed Tam-o’-Shanter. He did not move with his wonted stolidity. For, over and above the mere trail scent, his nostrils were assailed by other and more distressingly foreboding smells;--the smells he had caught as he had entered the gate;--the smells which grew ranker at every loping step he took. In half a minute he was at the bank. And before that time, he had abandoned the nose-to-earth tracking. For now all around him was that terrible scent. Back and forth dashed and circled and doubled Tam. And every evolution told him more of the gruesome story. Here among the bushes had lain a strange animal; an unwashen and pungent and huge animal; apparently sleeping after a gorge of chicken or lamb. Here, along the path, had come the children, with Wisp behind them. Here the strange dog had leapt forth; and here,--alongside that string of forgotten and sun-blown fish on the ground,--Wisp and the stranger had clashed. The dullest of scents could have told the story from that point:--the trampled earth, the spatters of dried blood, the indentation in the grass, where Wisp’s writhing body had striven so heroically to free itself from the crushing weight above it and to renew the hopeless battle. Wisp was dead. He was slain by that huge and rank-scented creature. His body had touched the river-brink, fully five feet from the scene of the fight. After that it had disappeared. For running water will not hold a scent. Yes, Wisp was dead. He had been murdered. He had been murdered,--this adored chum of his,--by the great beast whose scent was already graven so indelibly on Tam’s heartsick memory. There, at the river-edge, a few minutes later, Trask Frayne found Tam-o’-Shanter; padding restlessly about, from spot to spot of the tragedy; whimpering under his breath. But the whimper carried no hint of pathos. Rather was it the expression of a wrath that lay too deep for mere growling. At his master’s touch, the great collie started nervously; and shrunk away from the caress he had always craved. And his furtively swift motion, in eluding the loved hand, savoured far more of the wolf than of the trained house dog. The collie, in look and in action, had reverted to the wild. Tam trotted, for the tenth time, to the spot at the river-shore, where the Black had bounded into the water. Impatiently,--always with that queer little throaty whimper,--he cast up and down along the bank, in quest of some place where Wisp’s slayer might perhaps have doubled back to land. Presently, Trask called to him. For the first time in his blameless life, Tam hesitated before obeying. He was standing, hock-deep, in the swirling water; sniffing the air and peering through the dusk along the wooded banks on the far side of the stream. Again, and more imperatively, Frayne called him. With visible distaste, the collie turned and made his way back towards his master. Frayne had finished his own fruitless investigations and was starting homeward. Half-way to the house he paused and looked back. Tam had ceased to follow him and was staring once more at the patches of trampled and dyed earth. A third and sharper call from Trask brought the collie to heel. “I don’t blame you, old boy,” said Frayne, as they made their way towards the lighted kitchen. “But you can’t find him that way. To-morrow you and I are going to take a little trip through the mountains. I’d rather have your help on a hunt like that than any hound’s. You won’t forget his scent in a hurry. And you know, as well as I, what he’s done.” On the way to the house, Frayne paused at the sheepfold; and made a careful detour of it. But the inspection satisfied him that the fence (built long ago with special regard to the mountainpack’s forays) was still too stout to permit of any dog’s breaking through it. And he passed on to the house; again having to summon the newly-furtive collie from an attempt to go back to the river. “He won’t pay us another visit to-night, Tam,” he told the sullen dog, as they went indoors. “He’s tricky. And if he’s really on the rampage, here in the Valley, he’ll strike next in some place miles away from here. Wait till to-morrow.” But once more Tam did not follow his overlord’s bidding. For, at dawn of the morrow, when Trask came out of the house, shotgun in hand, the dog was nowhere to be found. Never before had Tam forsaken his duties as guardian of the farm to wander afield without Frayne. The jingle of the telephone brought Trask back into the house. On the other end of the wire was an irate farmer. “I’m sending word all along the line,” came his message. “Last night a dog bust into my hencoop and killed every last one of my prize Hamburgs and fifty-three other chickens, besides. He worked as quiet as a fox. ’Twasn’t till I heard a chicken squawk that I came out. That must have been the last of the lot; and the dog had got careless. I had just a glimpse of him as he sneaked off in the dark. Great big cuss he was. As big as a house. Looked something like a wolf by that bum light; and something like a collie, too. Last evening I got news that Gryce, up Suffern-way, lost a lamb, night before, from some prowling dog. D’you s’pose the dogs from the mountains is loose again?” “One of them is,” returned Frayne. “I’m going after him, now.” He hung up the receiver, and, gun under arm, made his way to the scow lying at the side of the dock. Crossing the river, he explored the bank for a half mile in both directions. Failing to find sign or trail of the Black, he struck into the mountains. It was late that night when Trask slouched wearily into his own house and laid aside his gun. “Any trace of him?” asked Mildred, eagerly. “Not a trace,” answered Frayne. “I quartered the range, farther back than we ever hunted before. And I asked a lot of questions at that God-forsaken mountaineer settlement, up there. That’s all the good it did. I might hunt for a year and not get any track of the beast. Those mountaineers are all liars, of course. Not one of ’em, would admit they’d ever seen or heard of the dog. If I’d had Tam with me, I might have caught the trail. To-morrow, I’ll see he goes along. He----” “Tam?” repeated Mildred, in surprise. “Why, wasn’t he with you? He hasn’t been home all day. He----” “Hasn’t been home? Do you mean to say he didn’t come back?” “No,” said his wife, worriedly. “When I got up this morning and found you both gone, I thought of course you’d taken him along, as you said you were going to. Didn’t----” “He wasn’t anywhere around when I started,” replied Frayne. “He’s--he’s never been away for a whole day, or even for a whole hour, before. I wonder----” “Oh, do you suppose that horrible brute has killed Tam, too?” quavered Mildred, in new terror. “Not he,” Trask reassured her. “Not he, or any other mortal dog. But,” he hesitated, then went on, shamefacedly, “but I’ll tell you what I _do_ think. I believe Tam has gone hunting, on his own account. I believe he’s trailing that mongrel. If he is, he has a man’s size job cut out for him. For the Black is as tricky as a weasel. Tam thought more of Wisp than he thought of anything else. And he was like another animal when he found what had happened, down yonder. Take my word for it, he is after the dog that murdered his chum. Whether he’ll ever get him, is another matter. But, if he really is after him, he’ll never give up the hunt, as long as he has a breath of life left in him. Either he’ll overhaul the cur or--well, either that or we’ll never see him again. There’s no sense in my poking around in the mountains without him. All we can do is wait. That and try to find Tam and chain him up till he forgets this crazy revenge-idea.” But even though the Fraynes did not see their cherished collie when they arose next morning, they did not lack for news of him. In the middle of a silent and doleful breakfast a telephone ring summoned Trask from the table. “That you, Frayne?” queried a truculent voice. “This is Trippler,--at Darlington. I got rotten news for you. But it’s a whole lot rottener for _me_. Last night my cow-yard was raided by a dog. He killed two of the month-old Jersey calves and pretty near ripped the throat out of one of my yearlings. I heard the racket and I ran out with my gun and a flashlight. The cow-yard looked like a battlefield. The dog had skipped. Couldn’t see a sign of him, anywheres. “But about half an hour later he came back. He came back while I was redding up the yard and trying to quiet the scared critters. He came right to the cow-yard gate and stood sniffing there as bold as brass; like he was trying to catch the scent of more of my stock to kill. I heard his feet a-pattering and I turned the flashlight on him. “He was _your_ dog, Frayne! That big dark coloured collie dog of yours. I saw him as plain as day. I upped with my gun and I let him have it. For I was pretty sore. But I must have missed him, clean. For there wasn’t any blood near his footprints, in the mud, when I looked. He just lit out. But I’m calling up to tell you you’ll have a big bill to pay on this; and----” “Hold on,” interrupted Frayne, quietly. “I’ll be up there, in twenty minutes. Good-bye.” As fast as his car could carry him, Trask made his way up the Valley to Darlington, and to the Trippler farm. There an irately unloving host awaited him. “Before you go telling me the whole story all over again,” Trask broke in on an explosive recital, “take me over to the exact spot where you saw Tam standing and sniffing. The ground all around here is soaked from the shower we had last evening. I want to see the tracks you were speaking of.” Muttering dire threats and whining lamentations for his lost calves, Trippler led the way to the cow-yard; pointing presently to a gap in the privet hedge which shut off the barns from the truck garden. Frayne went over to the gap and proceeded to inspect the muddy earth, inch by inch. “It was here Tam stood when you turned the light on him?” he asked. “Right just there,” declared Trippler. “And I c’n swear to him. He----” “Come over here,” invited Trask. “There are his footprints. As you said. And I’d know them anywhere. There’s no other dog of his size with such tiny feet. He gets them from his sire, Sunnybank Lad. Those are Tam’s footprints, I admit that. I’d know them anywhere;--even if they didn’t show the gash in the outer pad of the left forefoot; where he gouged himself on barbed wire when he was a pup.” “You admit it was him, then!” orated Trippler. “That’s all I need to hear you say! Now, how much----?” “No, no,” gently denied Frayne. “It isn’t anywhere near all you need to hear. Now, let’s go back into the cow-yard. As I crossed it, just now, I saw dozens of dog-footprints, among the hoof-marks of the calves. Let’s take another look at them.” Grumblingly, yet eager to add this corroboratory evidence, Trippler followed him to the wallow of churned mud which marked the scene of slaughter. At the first clearly defined set of footprints, Trask halted. “Take a good look at those,” he adjured. “Study them carefully. Here, these, for instance;--where the dog planted all fours firmly for a spring. They’re the marks of splay feet, a third larger than Tam’s; and not one of them has that gash in the pad;--the one I pointed out to you, back at the gap. Look for yourself.” “Nonsense!” fumed Trippler, albeit a shade uneasily, as he stood up stiffly after a peering study of the prints. “Anyhow,” he went on, “all it proves is that there was two of ’em. This big splay-footed cuss and your collie. They was working in couples, like killers often does.” “Were they?” Frayne caught him up. “Were they? Then suppose you look carefully all through this welter of cow-yard mud; and see if you can find a single footprint of Tarn’s. And while you’re looking, let me tell you something.” As Trippler went over the yard’s mud with gimlet eyes, Trask related the story of Wisp’s killing; and his own theory as to Tam. “He’s trailing that black dog,” he finished. “He struck his scent somewhere, and followed him. He got here a half-hour too late. And then when you fired at him he run off to pick up the trail again. But I doubt if he got it. For, the Black would probably be cunning enough to take to the river, after a raid like this. He’d have sense enough to know somebody would track him. That brute has true wolf-cunning.” “Maybe--maybe you’re right,” hesitated Trippler, after a minute search of the yard had failed to reveal a footprint corresponding with Tam’s. “And the county’s got to pay for ‘any damage done to stock by an unknown dog.’ That’s the law. I’m kind of glad, too. You see, I like old Tam. Besides, I c’n c’llect more damages from the county than I c’d c’llect from a lawsoot with a neighbour. What’ll we do now? Fix up a posse; like we did, the other times?” “No,” replied Trask. “It would do no good. The Black is too clever. And in summer there are too many ways to throw off the scent. Tam will get him,--if anyone can. Let’s "K'ite. Do you think I would tell a lie? I is the _gweat_ Diana. You is sort of forgetting, Orion." "No, I aren't," said Orion. "Oh, I am happy now!" "Well, lie down. I'll make up your bed, and you shall go to s'eep. We has a lot to do to-morrow, hasn't we?" "Yes, a lot," answered Orion, with a little laugh. "Oh, Di! will they let us?" "Course they'll let us," said Diana. "I has it all settled beautiful. Now, go to s'eep, p'ease, Orion." Orion did very soon enter the land of dreams, but little Diana lay broad awake. She was thinking hard, and her thoughts were wonderfully sensible for such a baby. The performance at the circus had turned out a great success. Diana had already appeared once or twice on Greased Lightning's back, but Ben Holt now kept her out of sight on purpose. He had caused rumors to be spread about her wonderful riding; his aim was to make people very anxious to see her again. He wanted the public to have a sort of craving for her. He hoped that when she finally appeared, dressed as the great Diana, with the bow and arrows, and when little Orion accompanied her with his girdle round his waist, and a sword in his hand, and when the two children rode round and round the circus on the fleetest horses in the company, that they would in very truth bring down the house--in short, that crowds would come to see them. Uncle Ben was full of hope with regard to Diana, but he was by no means so sure as far as Orion was concerned. If Orion would not play his part well, and look what he was--one of the prettiest boys in England, and one of the very youngest who had ever appeared in a circus--why, half the effect would be lost. He began to perceive, however, that cruelty had little or no effect on the child, and he was inclined to allow that little genius, Diana, to manage him in her own way. That night when the entertainment had come to an end, and Uncle Ben was seated at his cozy supper, he was much surprised when the door of the room was pushed suddenly open and a small girl, clad in a little white nightdress, made her appearance. "Is my dear Uncle Ben anywhere about?" called out the clear little voice. "My word! if that aint little Diana," said the man. "Come here this minute, you little romp, and get on my knee." Diana flew up to him, climbed on his knee, put her arms round his neck, and kissed him. "You's sort o' fond of me, I'm thinking," she said. "Yes, that I be, missy," he answered; "you are the 'cutest little gal I ever seed, and you are fond of poor Uncle Ben, eh?" "It all apends," replied Diana. "Now what do you mean by that, missy?" "It all apends," she repeated. "Wife, can you understand her?" questioned the man. "I think she means that it all depends, Ben." "Oh, depends--on what now, my dear?" "On whether you is good to my bwother or not." "Oh, is that all? Well, I'll be good to 'im." "He's awfu' fwightened of you." "Well, he needn't be. If you'll manage him I won't say a word." "Won't you twuly? Then I love you," said Diana. "Now, listen to me--I has been a-talking to him." "That's right, missy. Have a sip of my stout, won't you?" "No; I don't like it; it's black, nasty stuff. Put it away; I won't touch it. Well, now, listen to me, Uncle Ben. It apends altogether on whether you is good to Orion to-morrow or not whether he wides well, or whether he wides badly, and what I think is this--" "Well, missy, you are a very wise little miss for your age." "What I think is this," repeated Diana. "Let Orion wide G'eased Lightning and let me wide Pole Star." "But you can do anything with Greased Lightning," said the man. "Why, the 'orse fairly loves you, and Pole Star's a rare and wicious sort of beast." "I aren't fwightened; that aren't me," said Diana, in her usual proud, confident tone. "Orion isn't to wide a wicious sort of beast." She slipped down from the man's knees and stood before him. "It aren't me to be fwightened of any horse," she said. "I never was and I never will be." "I believe yer, miss," said Uncle Ben, gazing at her with great admiration. "But Orion he is--he is awfu' fwightened of Pole Star, and he sha'n't wide him. Now, G'eased Lightning, he'll do anything for me, and so what I say is this--let Orion wide him, and if he begins to dance about and get sort of fidgety, why, I'll stwoke him down. You know I could pwactice widing a little on Pole Star in the morning." "To be sure you could, missy." "Oh, my dear Ben," said Aunt Sarah at that moment, "you are never a-going to let either of them little kids ride a 'orse like Pole Star?" "You let me manage my own affairs," said the man, scowling angrily. "Well, I call it a shame," answered the woman. "Poor Aunt Sawah! you needn't be fwightened," said Diana. "I is never fwightened; that aren't me. I'll wide Pole Star, and Orion, he'll wide G'eased Lightning, _only_--now, Uncle Ben, is you listening?" "Yes, to be sure I am, missy," said Uncle Ben, taking another deep draught from his big glass of stout. "What's the 'only,' little miss?" "Let's pertend," said Diana. "Pretend what, missy?" "That after Orion has done it, after he has wode G'eased Lightning, he may go 'way." "Go away, missy?" "Yes, let's pertend it. If he thinks he's going away after he has done it, why, there's nothing he won't twy to do, 'cos, you see, he's longing to go. Let's say this to him: 'Orion, you's good boy, you's darlin' boy, and when you has done what I want you to do, you shall go way'--then he'll do it beaut'ful." "But he aint a-going," said the man, "he's my property. I has bought him; I has bought you both. You are sort of slaves to me." "No, I aren't a slave to nobody," said Diana, whose fierce little blood could not brook this word. "Well, you are a very good little gal, and so I am to pretend to Orion that he's going away; but now, when I don't mean him to go, that seems sort of cruel." "Oh, you leave it to me!" said Diana; "let him think he's going away and I'll manage. Tell Susan to tell him, and tell Aunt Sawah to tell him, and you tell him, and I'll tell him, and then he'll be as good as good, and as bwave--as bwave as a big giant." "Well, my dear, manage it your own way," said Uncle Ben; "but, all the same, it seems a shame. I aint what's called a very soft sort of man, but it seems a shame to deceive a little kid; only you manage it your own way, little missy." "I'll manage it my own way," echoed Diana. "I'm awfu' 'bliged." She tripped gayly out of the room. CHAPTER XXI. POLE STAR. The next day, at an early hour, the different performers had a grand rehearsal of their parts. It was a dress rehearsal. Holt was in high spirits, and Aunt Sarah, who stood just in front of the circus, petted and encouraged both Diana and Orion as much as possible. Orion felt shaky and looked very white, but the delicious thought that, after he had gone through those few minutes of agony, he might really be free to run away, to leave the dreadful, terrible circus forever, sustained him wonderfully. Diana had assured him that this could be managed. She had told him that Uncle Ben had promised that if he was a brave boy and sat well on Greased Lightning, and stood up when necessary, and, in short, went through the ordeal set him to do, without a murmur, he should be allowed to leave the circus that evening. It mattered nothing at all to little Orion that he did not know where he was to go, that he was a penniless and very small, very ignorant boy. The one object on which all his hopes were centered was the desire to get away from Uncle Ben and the terrible horses which he was forced to ride. "Now, 'member, you is to be bwave," said Diana; "you isn't to be fwightened. If you's fwightened, Uncle Ben won't let you go. You just be as bwave as possible, and never mind nobody. Now, then, it's your turn. Come 'long." Orion looked charming in his pretty dress. He wore a little sky-blue tunic, with small, tight knickers of white; his little legs and feet were bare, round his waist was a crimson girdle, and at his side was attached a toy sword. Diana wore a silk skirt and tights, her curling black hair fell partly over her forehead; her bold, black eyes were full of a strange mixture of frolic, affection, and defiance. She looked the personification of healthy life and courageous fire. In her hand she held the bow of Diana, and round her neck was slung a couple of arrows. She was a wonderfully graceful child in all her movements, and looked charming in her picturesque dress. The call for the children came, and the two bounded on the stage. The moment they did so, Diana ran up to Uncle Ben and took hold of the great whip which he carried. "You must let me do it my own way," she said; "you have pwomised. Orion won't be bwave boy if I don't manage him. Give me that whip." "Oh, but I say, little missy----" "Give me that whip," repeated Diana, flashing her eyes up at the man. "I is the gweat Diana and I order you. Give me the whip; I'll slash it; I know how. Ah, here comes G'eased Lightning. Come 'long, you beauty; come 'long, you darlin'." Diana ran fearlessly up to the horse, fondled its nose, and looked into its eyes; the creature stood perfectly still, bent its graceful head, and licked her little hand. "And it's a perfect brute to everyone else," thought Uncle Ben to himself, but this time he did not utter a word. The horse stood perfectly motionless until little Orion was mounted on its back. "Now, G'eased Lightning, you has got to be a good horse," said Diana, speaking to him in a confiding voice. "You isn't to fwighten Orion; 'member he's a giant, and it's a gweat honor for you to carry him, 'cos most times he lives up in the stars." "Come, missy, we have no time for that sort of nonsense," said Uncle Ben, who began to get impatient. "Give me back my whip." "No; I is going to slash the whip. Come, G'eased Lightning; twot, twot, p'ease." The horse began to amble gently forward. Little Diana went and stood by Uncle Ben's side. "I's managing," she said; "you shall have whip to-night; but I's managing now." The other performers stood round in breathless silence. Orion kept his seat manfully. Greased Lightning was as gentle as a lamb. "Good boy!" called out Diana; "vedy good little boy. Good horse, G'eased Lightning! you is a vedy good horse. Now then, go faster." Diana gave the whip a crack. The horse looked at her out of his big, intelligent eyes, and began to trot, but still very gently, round and round the circus. "Good boy," repeated Diana; "good horse! Now then, Orion, get up on to yous two foots; don't be fwightened. 'Member what will happen when it's over. Get up on to yous foots this minute." Poor little Orion scrambled in deadly terror on to his small feet; but the horse still went swift and smooth, neither budging nor turning to the right or the left. Diana once again cracked her whip. He went faster and faster. Orion began to lose his fear; he even laughed with excitement; the rose bloom came out on his delicate little face. The terrible hoops were brought, and the child made a manful effort to get through them. Diana cracked her whip and called out and encouraged him, and finally brought him successfully through the ordeal. He was taken off the stage wet with perspiration, and trembling all over, but at the same time he had a wild sort of triumph in his little heart. "I did it well; didn't I, Aunt Sarah?" he said. "You did it splendidly, my little love," said Aunt Sarah; "but I never did see a little gal like your sister. Oh, merciful Heavens! that man aint never a-going to let her ride Pole Star!" A black horse of immense strength and size was now brought upon the stage. This horse seemed to paw the air as he walked; his eyes were bloodshot and full of a dangerous light. "Remember it's your own fault, missy," said Uncle Ben; "this aint the 'orse I'd give you. I don't want any harm to come to you; but if you insist on that little chap, that aint a patch on you, riding Greased Lightning, why, there aint nothing for it but for you to ride Pole Star." "You don't 'uppose I's fwightened of Pole Star? Why, he's a weal beauty," said Diana. "He's the----" The man arrested the words on his lips. Diana had thrown down her whip and rushed across the stage. With just the same fearless confidence as, half an hour before, she had gone up to Greased Lightning--she now approached Pole Star. "You's pwetty, you's a darlin'," she said. She held out her tiny brown hand. "Give me a bit of sugar, somebody," she demanded. A girl who stood near ran away to fetch a lump. The child offered it to the horse. He looked at her, pawed the ground restlessly, and then, stooping, licked the sugar off her hand as tenderly as if he were a kitten. "Well, I never!" said Uncle Ben, breathing a great sigh of relief. "It's a beauty horse," repeated Diana; "I like it better nor G'eased Lightning. Pole Star, I's going to wide you; you's a dear, good horse." She stroked the creature's nose--the fierce eyes grew gentle--a moment later the child was mounted on its back. "Now, gee up, gee up!" called Diana. "P'ease, Uncle Ben, don't cwack your whip; I can manage Pole Star." She pulled at the reins, and the creature began, at first gently and then more rapidly, to run round and round the stage. After all, notwithstanding her bravery, it was an ordeal, for Pole Star could run double as fast as Greased Lightning. Soon, from running he seemed to take to flying, and little Diana gasped and lost her breath; but she sat firm as a statue, and never touched a hair of the creature's mane. "Now, Pole Star," she called out, when the horse had stopped for want of breath; "I's going to stand on you, and you must be vedy good." She patted the animal on its head; then she scrambled to her feet, and, holding the reins taut, stood firm as an arrow, while the creature once more flew round the stage. When her ride was over she had won the applause of the whole house. After this Diana and Orion were taken away to rest until the evening. They were given the best food and a great deal of petting from Aunt Sarah. As to Diana, she was in excellent spirits. "Oh, please, Di; nothing will make you stop, nothing will make you break your word?" said little Orion once to her. "What I pwomise I do," replied Diana, with dignity. And so the hours flew by, and at last the time arrived when the children were to appear before the footlights. The huge circus tent was packed to the highest gallery. There was, in short, not standing room in the audience part of the house. Uncle Ben, in the highest spirits, was darting here and there behind the wings, giving directions, gesticulating, ordering, rearranging. Little Diana flew up to him and took his hand. "What is you 'cited about?" she asked. "Is you fwightened 'bout anything?" "No, little gal, no--that is, provided you and your brother do your parts well." "We has pwomised," said Diana, with great firmness; "you needn't be fwightened; we has pwomised." The children were to appear as the last item of the first part of the performance. Uncle Ben felt that on them really turned the success of the evening. At last the crucial moment arrived. Two beautiful horses were led into the circus, and immediately afterwards little Diana, holding Orion by the hand, skipped on to the stage. She came lightly forward, almost up to the footlights, dropped a somewhat pert little courtesy, turned round, and, taking Orion's hand, danced up to where the two horses were impatiently pawing the ground. Uncle Ben, with his big whip in his hand, dressed in evening clothes, was standing at one side. A man came forward to help Diana to mount Pole Star--another gave his hand to Orion. "'Member, Orion, you has pwomised, and it all apends," said Diana, in a low, but very clear, voice. The little fellow looked at her. Her spirited action, the splendid color in her cheeks, the glow of excitement in her great big eyes, inspired him. He would not ride for those horrid people who were crowding all the seats in front, those horrid, terrible people who seemed to rise from the floor to the ceiling. He did not care anything about those faces, those cruel, staring eyes, those smiling lips; but he did care for Diana. He would ride his best for her. "Steady, G'eased Lightning," said the little girl; "you's to be good horse, 'member. Now, Pole Star, beauty, darlin', do just what Diana wants." The horses began to canter forward, going briskly and swiftly side by side. Greased Lightning's coal-black eye was fixed upon Diana as she sat on Pole Star's back. Pole Star felt the feather-weight of the hot hand on his mane, the touch of the little feet somewhere near his neck. There was a magnetic current of sympathy between the horse and the child. "Think you's a giant," she said once to Orion, as she shot past him in the race. The crowd, speechless with astonishment and delight for the first moment or two, now began to clap and cheer loudly. Crack went Uncle Ben's whip. The circus girls in the wings, the men, the clown, all watched the little pair with beating hearts. Diana they felt sure of, but what of little Orion? And yet a change had come over the child. His face was no longer pale; some of Diana's spirit seemed to have entered into his soul. The signal came for the pair to stand upon the bare, backs of their horses. Little Orion scrambled as quickly and nimbly to his feet as Diana herself. He caught the reins; crack again went the whip; the horses flew round and round. Now and then Diana said a soft word to Greased Lightning; now and then she stamped her small foot on Pole Star's neck. Each movement, each glance of the child, seemed to thrill through the willing beast. Incomprehensible as it may seem, both these wild, half-tamed creatures loved her. They kept straight, veering neither to left nor right, for her sake. The first part of the performance went safely through, but now came the more difficult and dangerous time. The children were now not only to ride the horses standing, but they were obliged to ride holding one foot in the air, then to keep on their steeds standing on tiptoe, and finally they had to spring through great rings made of tissue paper, and leap again upon the horses as they galloped through. Diana performed her task with unfailing exactness, always reaching the horse's back at the right moment, springing up, sitting down, standing first on one foot, then on the other, being apparently on wires, afraid of nothing, triumphant through all. Orion made a gallant effort to follow her example. In two minutes now the whole thing would be over. "Don't be fwightened, Orion; time's nearly up," whispered the gay, brave little voice in his ear. The horses flew, the children moved as if they were puppets, and all might now have been well if at that moment Diana herself--Diana the fearless, the brave, the unconquerable--had not slipped, slipped at the very moment when she was springing through one of the rings. The horse galloped on without her, and she lay prone upon the floor of the circus. Uncle Ben rushed madly to the rescue, and before Orion's horse had reached the spot he had caught the child in his arms. She was stunned by the fall, and lay white as death in his embrace. The house thought the fall had killed her, and there was a horrified murmur; but Diana was only stunned. In a moment she raised her cheery little voice. "I's awfu' sossy; I's all wight now," she said. "Where's Pole Star?" "Nay, little gal," said Uncle Ben, knowing well the temper of the house, "you must do no more to-night. The company, I know, will excuse you." Seating the child on his shoulder, and patting her hand affectionately, as if he were her father, he brought little Diana to the front. "I hope, ladies and gentlemen," he called out, "that you will excuse this great lady huntress to-night. But if you wish her to take another turn round on the back of the great Pole Star, she is willing to comply." "No!" shouted voice after voice in the gallery; "let little missy off. We'll come to see little missy another night. Three cheers for little missy!" The next moment Diana and Orion found themselves at the back of the stage. "Is it true, Di?" gasped Orion. "Is it all over?" "Yes; it's all over," answered little Diana. She leaned against the wall. "I's a bit giddy," she said; "but I'll be all wight by and by." Aunt Sarah, with tears in her eyes, brought the child a restorative. "Drink this, little love," she said; "you'll soon be much better, I'm sure." The curtain had fallen on the first half of the performance, and Uncle Ben came up in a huge good humor. "Missy, I hope you aint hurt," he said. "Hurt?" answered Diana. "What do a fall matter? I's as wight as wain. Didn't Orion do well, Uncle Ben?" "Yes, all things considerin'," said Uncle Ben. "We has a full house, missy, and I'm very much obliged to you. Now you had best go straight to bed. Sarah, take the kids off and give them a good supper, for they has earned it." Aunt Sarah took Diana's hand and led her to their bedroom. "But aren't we going away now?" said Orion. Aunt Sarah sat down at the foot of one of the beds with a white face. "Come to me, little missy," she said to Diana. The child went to her. "I's k'ite well," she said, "only a little giddy. Why, Aunt Sawah, you's kying." "I thought you were dead for a minute, my little miss; you that is the image of my Rachel, what the good God took from me. I thought you were dead, and it 'most broke my 'eart--oh, little missy, little darlin'!" "But, Diana, aren't we going away?" Said Orion. "You promised, and you never broke your word." "I pwomised, and I never break my word," said Diana. "Yes, Orion, yes; we is going away." "I declare," said Aunt Sarah, "I believe it would be the right thing to do. It would kill me if you was killed, missy--and them 'orses!" "They is darlin's," interrupted Diana. "Well, go to sleep now, and I'll fetch some supper," said Aunt Sarah. She shut the door behind the children, returning in a few minutes with bowls of bread and milk. Diana sat listlessly down on the nearest bench. "I's awfu' s'eepy," she said. She did not quite know what was the matter with her; it seemed as if something had suddenly knocked all her spirit away. She did not know herself without the brave spirit which God had put into her little breast. Orion gazed at her anxiously. "You do look queer," he said; "your eyes are bigger than ever, and they stare so. What's the matter, Di?" "Nothing," said Diana. "Aren't you going to eat your supper?" "I's wather sick," said Diana; "I don't want to eat. You had best eat all you can, Orion." "Yes, I had best," answered Orion, "'cos I won't have strength to run away if I hasn't plenty of food." He began to eat up his own basin of bread and milk, and, as it was not too large, he thought he might attack Diana's also; then he gave her an anxious glance. She was sitting strangely still, her hands lying idly in her lap, her eyes staring straight at the opposite wall. "'Member we is going away, and that you promised," he said. "Isn't it time for us to be off?" "Yes, Orion," she answered. "Well, drink off this teeny drop of milk; it will strengthen you." He brought the bowl to Diana, who sipped of a few spoonfuls; but then she shook her head. "I's sick," she said; "it aren't good to eat when you is sick." "Well, do come now," said Orion. "If you don't go at once they will find us; and you promised, and you never broke your word yet." "I underland," said Diana; "I would not bweak my word; that would be mean." "Well, let us go now." Diana slipped off the little bench on which she had seated herself. She was still in her circus dress; her little bow was hung at her side, her arrow slung round her neck. Orion was also in his pretty dress, with his tiny sword and belt, his blue jacket and little white knickers. "Let's put on our shoes," he said; "we can't go far in bare feet." "We can't go far in bare foots," echoed Diana, in a dreary sort of voice. "I's s'eepy. Shall we wun away in the morning, Orion?" "No; to-night! to-night!" he said, in terror. "You'll break your promise if we don't go to-night." "All wight," she answered. He brought her shoes, slipped them on her feet, buttoned them, and put on his own; then he took her hand in his. They opened the door of their bedroom and ran down a long passage, at the end of which was another door; it was on the latch. Orion opened it, and the little children found themselves at the back of the stage. There were no people about to see them, even Aunt Sarah was far away in one of the wings. "There! we is safe," said Orion. "We has runned away, and we are safe." "We has wunned away and we is safe," echoed Diana, in that dreary little voice. "But, Orion, I's drefful s'eepy." "Never mind," said Orion; "we'll sleep in the fields." "We'll s'eep in the fields," echoed Diana, in a vague manner. Orion took her hand; they ran as fast as they could down a shady lane, for the great circus tent had been put outside the town. CHAPTER XXII. THE MILKMAN. It was a lovely summer's night, and as the children ran, Orion looked up at the stars. "Why, it's a starful night!" he cried, in a joyful voice, "and there's me. Do look at me, Di! There I am up in the sky, ever so big and 'portant." "So you is," said Diana, laughing and then checking herself. "Is it far to----" "To where, Di?" "To the garding," said Diana; "to the dead-house where Rub-a-Dub is. Let's go and sit on the little bench and see the dead 'uns--let's count 'em; I wonder how many there is!" She stopped suddenly and gazed around her. "What do you mean?" said Orion, in some alarm. "We are nowhere near the garden. Don't you know where we are, Diana?" "Yes, I do now, course," she answered, with a laugh. "I think I was dweaming; it's my head; it's keer. I want to s'eep awfu'." "Well, here are the fields," said Orion; "here's a beautiful green field, and the moon is shining on it. Oh, and there's a hole in the hedge; let's creep in." "Let's k'eep in," said Diana. They pushed their way through the hole and found themselves in a clover field. The clover, slightly wet with dew, felt very refreshing to their hot little feet. "Isn't this 'licious?" said Diana. "Let's lie down on the g'een g'ass; let's s'eep here; I's awfu' s'eepy." "It's very near the circus," said Orion. "I'm rather frightened for fear Uncle Ben will find us." "No, he won't; it's all wight," said Diana. She allowed her little brother to lead her as far as the hedge, and then nothing would persuade her to go any further. Down on the damp grass she flung herself, and then next moment was fast asleep. Orion, aged six, did not think it wrong for Diana to sleep on the wet grass. The moon shone all over her bare little legs. She folded her arms when she lay down, and now there was not a stir, nor a movement from her. Far away, or at least it seemed far away to little Orion, he could see the blinking lights of the town, and when he stood on tiptoe he could also see the lights of the merry-go-rounds and the other accompaniments of the great circus. He knew that he was dreadfully near his tyrants, and he longed beyond words to awaken Diana and make her go farther away; but she was asleep--dead tired. He never could master her. There was nothing, therefore, but for him to lie down also, close to her. Accordingly, he flung himself on the grass, laid his head on her shoulder, nestling up close to her for warmth and protection, and in a few moments he had also forgotten his fears, and was calmly living in the blessed land of dreams. The great Orion overhead looked down on his tiny namesake, and the little boy dreamt that he was a giant in very truth, and that he and Diana were fighting their way through the world. The children slept, and presently the creatures of the night came out--the owls, and the bats, and the night moths--and looked with wonder at the queer little pair lying prone amongst the green clover. Thousands of wonderful night noises also began to awaken in all directions--the merry chirp of the cricket, the whir of the bat on its circling flight, the hum of the moths--but the children heard nothing, although the creatures of the night were curious about these strange little beings who, by good rights, ought not to be sharing their kingdom. At last, just when the first peep of dawn began to tinge the east, little Orion opened his eyes and rubbed them hard. With a great rush memory returned to him. He had run away; he had ridden Greased Lightning and had not fallen from his back; his terrible life in the circus was at an end. Uncle Ben was nowhere near to chide him. He and Diana had got off; but it was true that they had not put a great distance between themselves and Uncle Ben. Perhaps Uncle Ben, who had promised that he might go away if he did his part well, might change his mind in the morning. It was most important that he and his sister should go farther away as quickly as possible. Accordingly, he proceeded to wake Diana. Diana was very sound asleep indeed. He could see her face distinctly, for the first faint return of day was spreading a tender glow over it. She did not look pale; there was a hot spot on either cheek--a spot of vivid rose. "I am cold enough," thought the little fellow, "but Diana seems warm. Wake up, Di; wake up!" he said. "We has runned away, but we has not run far enough. Wake up, Di, and let's go on." Diana did not stir at all at his first summons. He spoke loudly, looking around him as he did so in some terror. A night owl, preparing to go home, was seated on a tree near by. The owl looked at Orion and hooted in a very melancholy manner. His voice seemed to say: "I never saw two greater little fools than you children in all my life." Orion felt rather afraid of the owl. Having failed to awaken Diana by words, he proceeded to shake her. This device succeeded. She opened her great, big, sleepy eyes and stared around her in bewilderment. "So you is our little mother now, Iris?" she said. "All wight; I's coming." She sat up on her grassy bed and rubbed her eyes, then stared at Orion and burst out laughing. "What are you laughing at?" said Orion. "We are in awful danger here. Uncle Ben may catch us any minute." "Who's Uncle Ben?" asked Diana. "Why, Di! how very queer you are. Don't you remember Uncle Ben, the awful man who has the circus?" "No, I don't," said Diana. "Is it true that Rub-a-Dub's dead?" "Oh, Di! Rub-a-Dub died weeks ago. What does it matter about a mouse? I'm frightened about Uncle Ben. If he catches us he'll change his mind, perhaps, and I cannot ride Greased Lightning again. Don't speak so queer, Di. Do rouse yourself. We must get out of this as fast as we can." "As fast as we can," echoed Diana. "All wight, Orion; I's k'ite sati'fied." "Well, come, then," said Orion; "get up." "I don't think I care to." "But we can't run away if you are lying there." "No more we can," said Diana. She laughed again. "Isn't it fun?" she said. "And so Rub-a-Dub isn't dead after all?" "Yes; of course he is." "Orion, look!" said the child; "look!" "Look at what?" answered the little fellow. "Oh, Diana! don't say it's Uncle Ben!" "I don't know nothing 'bout no Uncle Ben; but didn't you see something flash there?--something white, just over there? I know who it was; it was mother. Mother has gone to the angels, but she has come back. Mother! mother! come here! Call her, Orion; call her, call her!" "Mother! mother!" said the little boy; "mother, come here!" But there was no answer to this cry, which, on the part of Orion at least, was full of agony. No answer either from the heaven above or the earth beneath. "It was a mistake, I s'pect," said Diana. "Mother is in heaven; she's a beautiful angel, singing loud. Well, let's come 'long." She staggered to her feet, and, supported by Orion, began to walk across the field. "Let's go into the garding," she said. Poor little Orion was quite in despair. "We are miles from the garden," he said. "I think you have gone silly." "S'pect I has," said Diana. "What fun!" "And you have got such a queer look on your face." "A k'eer look on my face?" repeated Diana. "Yes; and your eyes, they are ever so big; they frighten me." "My eyes k'ite fwighten you, poor little boy," said Diana. "Well, let's wun; let's get to the garding. Why, it's the day mother went away to the angels, and we has got no lessons. Where's Iris? I want Iris." "So do I," said Orion. "Oh, Di! what is to become of us? You frighten me." "K'ite fwighten poor little boy," echoed Diana. "I's sossy, but I can't help it. I's giddy in my head. Does this way lead to garding, Orion?" "No. What are we to do?" said Orion. "Oh, I am so frightened!" He really was. Diana's strange behavior was more than he could understand. "Oh, I'm so bitter hungry!" he cried. He flung himself on the grass. Diana stood and looked at him with a puzzled expression on her face. "Why, you is a poor little boy," she said. "Now, if you'll take my hand we'll go indoors, and Fortune will give us a lovely bekfus. Come, Orion; don't be fwightened, poor little boy." They walked across the field. By this time the sun was up and the place felt warm and dry. Little Orion, shivering in his queer circus dress, was glad of this, and a faint degree of returning courage came into his heart. Diana did not seem to feel anything at all. She walked along, singing as she walked. "We's going to the dead-house," she said. "Rub-a-Dub's dead." "You'll never know fear any more, Little dear; Good-by, Rub-a-Dub." "Oh, don't Di! You make me feel so frightened," said Orion. "Why do you talk like that? Can't you 'member nothing?" "Course I 'member," said Diana. "Rub-a-Dub's dead." "Never know fear, Little dear; Rub-a-Dub's dead." "Come this way," said Orion, taking her hand. She was quite willing to follow him, although she did not in the least know where she was going. "S'pect I aren't well," she said at last. "Don't be fwightened, poor little boy. S'pect I aren't k'ite well." "I's so hungry," moaned Orion. "Well, let's go into the house; let's have bekfus. Where's Fortune? Come 'long, Orion; come 'long." They had reached the highroad now, and were walking on, Orion's arm flung round Diana's waist. Suddenly, rattling round a corner of the country road, came a man with a milk cart. He was a very cheery-looking man with a fat face. He had bright blue eyes and a kindly mouth. "Hullo!" he said, when he saw the two little children coming to meet him. "Well, I never! And what may you two be doing out at this hour?" Diana gazed up at him. "I's going to the garding," she said. "I's to meet Iris in garding. We is to 'cide whether it's to be a pwivate or a public funeral." "Bless us and save us!" said the man. "Don't mind her," said Orion; "she's not well. She fell off a horse last night, and there's something gone wrong inside her head. I s'pect something's cracked there. She's talking a lot of nonsense. We has runned away, and we is desperate hungry. Can you give us a drink of milk?" "Well, to be sure," said the man, smacking his lips as he spoke. "I never saw anything like this afore, and never heard anything like it, neither. Why, it's like a page out of a printed book. And so you has run away, and you belong to the circus, I guess. Why, you are in your circus dresses." "See my bow and arrow," said Diana. "I is the gweat Diana; I is the gweatest huntwess in all the world." "To be sure; to be sure!" said the man. "And I am Orion," said the boy, seeing that Diana's words were having a good effect. "You can watch me up in the sky on starful nights. I am a great giant, and this is my girdle, and this is my sword." "I never heard anything so like a fairy tale afore," said the man. "Are you sure you are human, you two little mites?" Diana took no notice of this. "I want to get into the garding," she said. "I want to lie down in the garding; I want Iris; I want mother. Man, do you know that my mother has gone away to the angels? She is playing a gold harp and singing ever so loud; and once we had a little mouse, and it was called Rub-a-Dub, and it's deaded. We gived it a public funeral." "Oh, do let us have some milk, and don't mind her!" said Orion. The man jumped down off the cart, and, turning a tap in the great big can, poured out a glass of foaming milk. He gave it to Orion, who drank it all off at the first draught. He then filled out a second measure, which he gave to Diana. She took it, raised it to her lips, took one or two sips, and then gave it to Orion. "There's something sick inside of me," she said. "I don't know what's the matter; I isn't well." "She had a bad fall last night at the circus," said Orion. "She fell from one of the rings. I s'pect something's cracked inside her head." "I s'pect something's c'acked inside my head," echoed Diana, looking up piteously. "I want to go to the garding; I want to lie down." "Well, look here," said the man; "this is more than I can understand. You had best, both of you, go back to the circus, and let the people who has the charge of you see what's the matter." "No!" screamed Orion; "never! never!" He suddenly put wings to his little feet, and began to fly down the road, away from the milkman. Diana stood quite still. "Aren't he silly little boy?" she said. "But he mustn't go back to circus, milkman; it would kill him. I isn't able to wide to-day, 'cos I's c'acked inside my head; and he mustn't wide without me, 'cos it would kill him. Couldn't we go to your house, milkman, and rest there for a bit?" "Well, to be sure; I never thought of that," said the man. "So you shall, and welcome. Jump up beside me on the cart, missy." "I can't, 'cos my head's c'acked," said Diana. "Then I'll lift you up. Here, you sit there and lean against the big milk can. Now, we'll set Peggy going, and she will soon overtake little master." Diana laughed gleefully. "Do you know, you's an awfu' nice man?" she said. "I am glad you think so, missy." The man took the reins and Peggy started forward. They soon overtook little Orion, who was lifted also into the milk cart. Then the milkman turned swiftly round and carried the children back to a small house on the outskirts of the town. When he got there he called out in a lusty voice: "Hi, Bessie! are you within?" A woman with a smiling face came to the door. "Now, what in the world is the matter with you, Jonathan?" she answered. "Only this, wife. I met the queerest little pair in all the world on the road. Can't you take them in and give them rest for a bit? I believe the little miss is hurt awful." "I's c'acked inside my head, but it don't matter," said Diana. The woman stared from the children to the man; then something in Diana's face went straight to her heart. "Why, you poor little mite," she said, "come along this minute. Why, Jonathan, don't you know her? Course it's the little missy that we both saw in the circus last night. Didn't I see her when she fell from the ring? Oh, poor little dear! poor little love!" CHAPTER XXIII. FORTUNE. Uncle William took the children straight up to London. They spent the night at a great big hotel, and in the morning he went alone to have a long consultation with one of the best detectives in New Scotland Yard. When he returned after this interview, Iris came to meet him with a wise look on her face. "I know what to do," she exclaimed. "Well, then, my dear, it's more than I do," replied Uncle William. "It's the only thing," repeated Iris. "Let's go straight home." "Home? Do you mean to the Rectory? Why, we have just come from there." "I don't mean the Rectory. I mean our real home," answered Iris. "Let's get back at once to Delaney Manor." "I don't see much use in that," answered Uncle William. "It's all a feel I have inside of me," replied Iris. "Often and often I get that feel, and whenever I obey it things come right. I have a feel now that I shall be nearer to Diana and to Orion in the old garden than anywhere else. I always try to obey my feel. Perhaps it's silly, but I can't help it. Do you ever get that sort of feel inside of you, Uncle William?" "If I did," replied Uncle William, "your Aunt Jane would say that I was the silliest old man she had ever come across." "But you aren't, you know. You are a right good sort," answered Apollo, in a patronizing tone. "I am glad you think so, my boy," replied Uncle William. "Well, now," he added, "I always did hate London, and in the middle of summer it seems to me that it is wanting in air. I once heard a countryman say that he believed people only breathed turn about in London, and it really seems something like that this morning. The place is so close and so used-up that there is not a breath anywhere; so, Iris, if you have got that feel, and if you will promise not to tell your Aunt Jane that _that_ is your reason for returning to the Manor, why, we may just as well do so--only, I suppose, the place is all shut up." "Fortune, at any rate, is there," replied Iris; "and if anybody can help us to find Diana and Orion, it's Fortune; for she had them, you know, Uncle William, from the moment the angel brought them down from heaven. She had to do for them and nurse them, and tend them from that moment until Aunt Jane took them away. Oh, yes!" continued Iris; "if there is a person who will help us to find them, it's Fortune." "She partakes of the strange names which seem to run in your family," answered Uncle William. "But there, it is as good an idea as any other, and we shall at least each of us have our proper number of breaths at Delaney Manor. That certainly is in favor of the scheme." Accordingly, that very afternoon, Uncle William, Iris, and Apollo took the train into Devonshire. They arrived at the Manor in the evening. Nobody expected them, and the place looked, to Uncle William, at least, very dull and desolate. But when Iris saw the quaint old gateway, and when Apollo felt his feet once again upon the well-known avenue, the sadness of heart which had oppressed both children seemed to lift itself as if it had wings and fly right away. "Let's go to the garden this very instant," exclaimed Iris, looking at her brother. They clasped each other's hands and, flying along the well-remembered haunts, soon reached their favorite garden. "Oh, Apollo! I live; I breathe again," said Iris, panting as she spoke. "Oh, I am happy once more!" "Let us see if anything has been injured while we were away," said Apollo. "Oh, I wonder if anybody has watered our pretty gardens. I planted a lot of mignonette the day before I went away. I wonder if it has come up." The children wandered about the garden. The dead-house was now empty; the four little gardens looked sadly the worse for want of watering and general looking after. The cemetery, however, looked much as usual; so also did the greenswards of grass, the roses, the different summer flowers; and finally Iris and Apollo visited the little summer-house, and seated themselves on their own chairs. "The garden has not run away," said Apollo. "That's a comfort. I'm real glad of that." "It's exactly like the garden of Eden," said Iris, panting as she spoke. "I don't think anybody," she continued, "could be naughty in this garden." Apollo kicked his legs in a somewhat impatient manner. "I feel dreadfully hungry, Iris," he said. "Suppose we go to the house now and have some supper." "Who is that coming down the walk?" said Iris. It was dusk by this time, and in the little summer-house all was dark; but Iris, as she spoke, sprang to her feet, and the next moment found herself clasped in Fortune's motherly arms. "My darling!" said the woman. "Why, it drives me near mad to see you again. And now, what in the world is up with the two of you, and where are the others? There's an elderly gentleman--a clergyman--in the house, and he said I was to look for you here, and that you were going to spend the night. What does it mean, Iris? Oh, my dear! I can't see your face, for it is too dark; but you are very light. Why, you are no weight at all, my honey." "I expect I'm rather worn out," replied Iris, in her old-fashioned tone. "You know, Fortune, when mother went away she told me to be a mother to the others, and--oh, Fortune, Fortune! I have failed, I have failed." Iris' little arms were clasped tightly round her old nurse's neck; her face was hidden against her bosom; her heavy sobs came thick and fast. "Why, my poor dear, you are exactly like a feather," said Fortune; "it aint to be expected that a young thing like you could be a mother. But what's gone wrong, dearie? what's gone wrong?" "They are lost. That's what has gone wrong," said Iris. "Orion and Diana are lost, Fortune." "Sakes alive, child! stand up and speak proper," said Fortune. "Your little brother and sister lost! Impossible; you are joking me, Iris, and that aint fair, seeing I was with you since you drew the breath of life." "Do you think I could joke upon such a subject?" said Iris. "You say I am like a feather--that is because I have all wasted away from--from fretting, from--from misery. Yes, Fortune, they are lost, and I wish I were dead. I feel it here so dreadfully." The child pressed both her hands against her heart. "I have not been a mother," she continued. "Oh, Fortune! what is to be done?" "You jest sit down on my lap and stop talking nonsense," said Fortune. "Why, you are trembling like an aspen. You jest rest yourself a bit alongside o' me. Now then, Master Apollo, tell me the whole truth, from beginning to end. The two children lost? Now, I don't believe it, and that's a fact." "You'll have to believe it, Fortune," said Apollo, "for it's true. They went out one day about a month ago--we think they must have gone to some woods not far from that horrid Rectory, but nobody seems to know for certain--and they just never came back. We missed them at tea-time, and we began to look for 'em, and we went on looking from that minute until now, and we have never found either of 'em. That's about all. They are both quite lost. What I think," continued the little boy, speaking in a wise tone, "is that Diana must have met the great Diana of long ago, and gone right away with her, and perhaps Orion has been turned into one of the stars that he's called after. I don't really know what else to think," continued Apollo. "Fudge!" said Fortune. "Don't you waste your time talking any more such arrant nonsense. Now, the two of you are as cold and shivery as can be, and I doubt not, as hungry also. Come straight away to the house. This thing has got to be inquired into." "Oh, Fortune! can you do anything?" asked Iris. "Can I do anything?" said Fortune. "I have got to find those blessed children, or my name's not Fortune Squeers. Did your mother bring me all the way from America to be of no use in an emergency like the present? You needn't fret any more, Iris; nor you either, Apollo. Just come right along to the house and have your cozy, warm supper, the two of you, and then let me undress you and put you into your old little beds, and I'll sleep in the room alongside of you, and in the morning we'll see about getting back those two children. Lost, is it? Not a bit of it. They are mislaid, if you like, but lost they aint--not while Fortune is above ground." Fortune's strong words were of the greatest possible comfort to Iris. It is true that Aunt Jane had told her somewhat the same, day by day--Aunt Jane was also sure that the children were certain to be found--but, as far as Iris could gather, she only spoke, and never did anything to aid their recovery; for Iris had no faith in detectives, nor secret police, nor any of the known dignitaries of the law. But she put the greatest possible faith in the strong, cheery words of her old nurse, and she returned to the house clasping Fortune's hand, and feeling as if the worst of her troubles were at an end. The greater part of Delaney Manor was shut up, and Fortune and two other old servants were left in charge; but very soon a comfortable meal was spread for the travelers, a room was provided for Uncle William, and Iris and Apollo slept once more in the dear old nursery. How very sound Iris did sleep that night! How happy she felt once more! Fortune had dragged in her bed, and laid it on the floor close to the little girl's side, and the sound of Fortune's snores was the sweetest music Iris had listened to for a long time. "Fortune will find the others, and I can be a real mother once more," she whispered over and over to herself. And so she slept sweetly and dreamed happily, and awoke in the morning with color in her cheeks and hope in her eyes. CHAPTER XXIV. ON THE TRAIL. It was on the very evening that Orion and Diana had left the great circus that Uncle William and the two children arrived at Delaney Manor, for Delaney Manor was only five miles distant from the prosperous seaside town of Madersley. Now, Uncle Ben had very little idea, when he brought the two children to the southwest of England, that he was really taking them back to their native country. These things, however, are ordered, and the wisest man in the world cannot go against the leadings of Providence. Uncle Ben thought to hide the children from their best friends, whereas, in reality, he was taking them home once more. But two little circus children might wander about at their own sweet will at Madersley, and be heard nothing whatever of at Delaney Manor, and these little children might never have been found, and this story might have had a totally different ending, but for Fortune. When Fortune, however, lay down on her mattress by Iris' side, she thought a great deal before she went to sleep. She thought, as she expressed it to herself, all round the subject, to the right of it, and to the left of it. She thought of it in its breadth, and she thought of it in its height, and, having finally settled the matter to her own satisfaction, she went to sleep, and soothed little Iris with the comforting music of her snores. On the following morning she had an interview with Mr. Dolman. "I want to ask you a straight question, sir," she said. "What is it the police are doing? It seems a mighty strange thing to me that two little children should be lost in the middle of a civilized country like England." "It seems a stranger thing to me," replied Uncle William. "I am dreadfully puzzled over the whole matter. We have now four detectives at work, but up to the present they have not got the slightest clew to the children's whereabouts." "As like as not," said Fortune, "these two have been stolen by gypsies." "We thought of that at once," said Uncle William. "Yes," interrupted Fortune, "and then, when you couldn't make the thing fit, or find your clew, you dropped it. Now let me tell you, sir, that aint our way in America. When we get the faintest ghost of a clew we cling on to it as if it were grim death, and we don't let it go, not for nobody. It's my belief that gypsies are at the bottom of the matter, and why have not you and your detectives looked in every gypsy encampment in the length and breadth of England?" "There were some gypsies in our neighborhood, only we did not know it the first day," continued Mr. Dolman, "and their camp was of course thoroughly examined, but no little people in the least resembling the children were found there." "Then of course it goes without saying," continued Fortune, "that the gypsies passed on the little dears to other folk. Now the question is, What sort of folk would be interested in a little pair like them? They was both young, both lissom, both handsome, and Miss Diana was the bravest child I ever come across--maybe they was sold to someone to train 'em to walk on the tight rope." Uncle William smiled indulgently. "The detectives would certainly have found that out by this time," he said. "Besides, there were no traveling companies of any sort within a radius of quite fifteen miles." "Very well," said Fortune; "then, perhaps, sir, you'll allow me to manage things my own way. I aint a detective, but I'm bent on detective work for the time being. I'm going straight off to Madersley this morning. I'm going to have descriptions of those children printed in very big characters, and posted all over Madersley." "And why specially all over Madersley?" asked Mr. Dolman. "'Cos Madersley is, so to speak, their native town," answered Fortune. "Why, there aint a person in Madersley who don't know Delaney Manor; and strangers, when they come there, drive out to see Delaney Manor as they would any other big place, and folks at this time of year travel from far to stay at Madersley, because the place is bracing and the coast good for bathing. So you see, Mr. Dolman, there'll be lots of people who will read my descriptions, and when they read 'em they'll begin to talk about the children, and there's no saying what may happen." "It doesn't sound a bad idea," said Mr. Dolman. "Bad!" repeated Fortune. "It's a first-rate idea; it's an American idea. In America we never let the grass grow under our feet. I'm off to Madersley this minute to see after those posters. Why, we post up everything in America, every single thing that is lost, let alone children, and we do it in big type, as big as they make it, and we put the posters on the walls, and wherever there's a scrap of available space. By your leave, sir, I'm off to Madersley now." Fortune was as good as her word. She not only went to Madersley and interviewed some of the best printers in the place, but she also visited the police station, and told the police to be on the lookout. "For the two youngest little Delaneys are missing," she said, "and found they must be, if heaven and earth are moved to accomplish the job." The superintendent of police remembered that he had already had notice of two children being missing somewhere in the North of England, but as he thought it extremely unlikely that such children
