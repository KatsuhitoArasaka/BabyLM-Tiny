I have turned it on and it is doing its little best  but our guests from the south are obviously  
I'll, I'll  
sequins, it sounds like  Come Dancing .
Oh I don't know I'm sure  say anything rude.
No  honest.
Do they?
some voices aren't allowed to er appear.
Are you still in here?
It it's okay carry on it's alright I'm, I  
Right.
Okay I'm sorry I haven't had level three supervision groups before so this is a whole new experience for me 
Well we're very high powered you know  
Chris has given me my instructions so 
Oh no 
I'm supposed to first say is th are you finding the course okay and to ask you about your projects.
So course okay so far?
supervisor.
So Mike have you got your project sorted out?
Well it's more or less in hand, yeah.
What what you're doing?
Yeah 
With Stewart?
yeah.
So is it just a continuation of what you've done anyway?
Well more or less but he weren't amused at any of the results so 
Oh I see right.
I've  got to start again .
That's rotten.
So are y are you just do 
No it's quite fair actually.
are you just doing are you just doing one er sorry j er are you just doing one project  a t a two term project?
Yeah.
Right so you're s you're sorted out.
Charles what are you doing?
Er I'm doing something on wild salmon.
Oh right.
Who, who are you er with?
Er with Gordon.
?
Yeah.
Oh right, so what are you, tell us about it, what are you going to do?
Erm well  Alex and I are both doing it but Alex has got his own rivers  so he's doing it on his own sort of thing 
Alex 
and er I'm  I'm, think I'm doing mine more sort of related to er the eggs.
Right.
So where 
Well sort of looking in that, that s er on the Tyne.
Oh right.
So I mean is this eggs that are put in by the, I mean I 
Er yeah I think it will have something to do with that, yeah.
I've sort of er I've
So are you just doing a lit is it, is it a two term project as well?
Yeah.
And you're just starting a  research?
Yeah.
Right.
I've started that, I've gotta, just gotta  I went and played on the computers yesterday.
You went what?
And played on the computers yesterday  
Oh right, oh right.
Have you all, by the way have you all tried this C D rom thing
Mm
in the library?
It's quite fun.
It's quite fun, have you tried that?
Yeah that's what I tried yesterday.
Has anyone got anything useful out of it yet?
No it's  
Yeah I know but they're not exactly over run with them are they?
in the library or down here we have to do  
Have you got to be more specific with your requests?
I haven't tried it.
Well probably but it do it s I mean it, you either put in  I, I mean I  most, most 
You're doing  
most of the things that I've done have been on Atlantic salmon and you put in Atlantic salmon and you get seven thousand eight hundred 
Yeah.
and forty abstracts out  
Right 
forget that.
And you narrow it down and you get zero.
Oh right, right.
Right, so you've got to play about with the system a bit more?
I think so I think so.
Right.
ASFA I think it's more helpful I think than C D rom isn't it?
What's the difference between ASFA and C D rom?
It's spelt different.
No but ASFA is just on the  scientific end

Oh.
You can ask him if it's alright to keep you in your tablets.
I'm going to start .
I tell you when I was in here it was just keeping calm.
And I'd no been to  bloody.
Aye well  Nothing Doctor  can do,
I know but he .
He would need to go up and see .
Doctor 
Ah.
What's up with young John today?
Oh my  Strathclyde Hospital on Wednesday,
Aha.
and they er sort of X-rayed me, took a urine sample, took a blood sample, er Doctor
Aha.
He examined me.
Erm he f he found, know how they were wrong about a slight murmur on my heart?
Mhm.
He couldn't find it.
He says it could have been  anxiety
Mhm.
or 
hospital
Aye just
So there was nothing really 
nothing to worry about.
Good.
I'm delighted to hear that.
But he did say that er it'll take three weeks before he can get back to me about sending me to the Law  
Mhm.
He says that, see the biopsy and the other?
Yeah.
He says that I might not need to get it right?
Because he, he'll be able to tell off my blood.
Mhm.
So he, he's still to decide about that.
Yeah.
Right.
Aye, and he also agreed with you about the lump in my back.
Mhm.
Right?
Yeah.
And he s he said the same as you, that er
If it's not bothering you, leave it alone.
Aye.
Said the exact same as you.
Oh aye.
Och aye.
It's not, not sensible.
Now then.
Here you are young John.

Mhm.
Yeah,
something for it?

How're you doing with the, the drink?
Oh.
I have my good days and bad days.
How many good ones and how bad ones?
during the day.
Too many bad ones.
I just cannae seem to get off it at all.
Well, keep it down as low as you can because the lower you keep it, the less chance there is of getting this biopsy done.
I thought they were just going to X-ray me back, but they X-rayed everything.
Oh they would do.
They done the lot,
Yeah.
front, back, side.
Yeah.
Oh aye.
There you are John, And

Doctor   what, if that happens Doctor  says that the next time he wants to see us along with him.
Mhm.
Yeah yeah.
Because he's worrying us.
Yeah.
See I don't know if it's just part real  or if he's just trying to frighten me.
Mhm.
It could be.
This i this is the thing, with youngsters like that, you never know.
I mean he doesn't want for nothing, he gets as much as I can give him.
It's nothing it's nothing to do 
He's got, he's got everything he could want.
Aye, it's nothing to do with wanting.
I mean see my see my next door neighbours, they're good

Now these new wheely-bins, you take a turn each.
Mhm.
I'll just take the two, and Billy'll take them out the next week.
Mhm.
But on Sunday night we weren't in, and Billy looked in the kitchen.
We were at a night out.
He must have looked in the kitchen window.
Just to see
Mhm.
whether to take the bins out or not.
But our John was sitting reading the paper.
He's got a, they're all talking about me, he says they're listening at the walls or standing in the clossies 
Mhm.
I mean the things he's coming away with aren't real.
Aye.
Why is he seeing Doctor  ?
He's .
He's gonna see him again, don't get me wrong, Doctor  said he'll send for the both of us, right?
Mhm.
But he's getting to the point where I'm ready for saying to him away you go down to your granny's right, but my mam cannae live with him either.
No no.
Cos she's the same way.
She's phoning me.
She 
I think Doctor  only sits once a month, and  
Oh no.
No.
No.
Every week.
Is it every week?
Is it?
Mhm.
I thought it was only once a month.
No.
See when he's thing, you see when he's er down at his granny's, my mummy and my daddy are actually talking round about him trying to kid on that they're, they're ignoring him.
They they try to ignore him.
Know what I mean?

I'll get on to him and we'll soon get this .
See I cannae walk by a bus stop.
There're two people at a bus stop, they two people's talking about him.

A man walked in and he says hello to John and that and how's it going and that, he came into see you and I sat, I mean I came in 
Mhm.
out of the road, what's that man saying about me?
Aye I heard him saying how do you put up with an arsehole like that?
Thinks, he's paranoid.
He thinks everybody's talking about him.
Aye.
You know what I mean?
But this has just come on.
Mhm.
Oh aye.
This is how it comes.
This is how it comes, just
And I mean  I'm not wanting to make up any .
Ah but Doctor , it's plain to you, John's 
It may be the best thing for him.
John has been  put under psychologist because he was slow at school right?
Aha.
Aye.
And this is the start.
This is what's in his head.
He's no equal with anybody else.
Yet 
Ah.

Yes yes yes.
But this is the thing, if he doesn't go there, if he needs to go there and he doesn't go there, he's going to get worse.
Aye.
Aye.
I mean he's going to get worse and worse and worse.
See, the way I feel I've, it's not a case
She even thinks
I know there was  
see because he w he was slow, he had trouble with learning 
Mhm.
at school, right?
Mhm.
See he  
S he thinks that all the ones that were at school with him are s talking 
about him.
Mhm.
That's right 
Still yet.
that's what he said, the first night he came in.
Aye.
The f the thing is if he needs to go in for treatment, he's only going to get worse if he doesn't get it.
But he'll say to me 
I said that and all.
But as I, like you know John when he talks about it.
If they found out 
I'm up there like I'm just going to stay up there, I'm never mind to come back here.

Do you think if I, do you think if I gave him a fright,s see the, time he says he's going off to his granny's and I say away you go, and my mam says she's not taking him.
Would you would you like to take the chance?
No.
I wouldn't either.
I know he's starting all these things, see his computers and that?
S maybe if I says to him away you go to your granny's and then and you're not taking anything with you.
No?

Nobody ever used to make that mistake at one time you know why?
No.
Because everything worked was wasn't in decimal.
Mm.
All the distances were in twelves 
Mm.
and for and weights were in fourteens so 
Aha.
nobody ever thought about anything being a decimal.
Mhm.
So nobody had any problems with that.
No of course that everything's de- you know everything's decimal time
Yeah.
becomes quite an awkward calculation.
It didn't used to be.
It didn't.   not been interrupted.
same constant speed.
So you work the same the constant speed.
.
Yeah w shouldn't matter ,
yeah.
that's fine.
Aha.
Doesn't make any difference at all that doesn't.
Erm so you would have done  er yeah then you've got You've got your speed of distance over time correctly.
Mm.
Or time is distance over speed.
It's all right, but  you've then  gone that's not nought point two five minutes the speed's per hour.
Isn't it?
Mm.
The speed is per hour  isn't it?
So that would have been  point two five which should have been fifteen minutes.
Yes that's sixtieth of an hour 
Which is point two five of an hour.
Be very careful with your 
Mm.
units.
Yeah.
That's
Mm.
The calculation's fine what you've done's fine just mucked 
Put the wrong 
the units up.
Yeah.
Right?
So that's  How many minutes earlier?
Now you've not done that you've actually done his journey time .
Mm.
Mm?
So careful read the question.
You must read the question!
Alright, how're you getting on with them?
Or have I stopped you?
Didn't know what I'm supposed to be doing with that .
Your supposed to be doing them rotate them through Do this one first.
How do you mean  them?
Hundred and eighty degree rotation around C.
doing it Do you mean drawing it on Using this drawing it?
Yeah.
You've done rotations and reflections and so forth haven't you?
Mm.
Mhm.
that rotated a hundred and eighty degrees about that.
Mm.
brought it by  isn't it?
But I know what to do I don't know what you want me to do.
I want it I want it shown as a hundred and eighty degree rotation.
There's an exam question  Rotate that
Yeah.
about that point the hu Through a hundred and eighty degrees .
Mm.
four.
What your not so  Fine.
Yeah.
Okay yes good.
That's alright.
Use the patterns to write down  the A three.
A Three is that that that that that.
A four    Lets have a look.
Is it done?
No I haven't done anything yet I'm on .
Look
I can't do it!
I can't .
You haven't done rotations have you?
Yeah I have but I don't how to do them like this I've not seen it been d drawn out like that.
Right draw something from the centre of rotation to the the figure.
Mm.
Rotate that bit through a hundred and eighty degrees where's it go?
Over here.
Over there.
There's a hundred 
Yes.
and eighty innit?
Trace the original.
Yes.
Mm.
Round the centre of rotation  it to the spoke while she's up the other spoke.
Dum.
Mm.
Mm?
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
it's as simple as that.
Isn't it?
.
Go on then.
as if you've drawn.
Have you got a pencil?
No I was looking at the other one.
No I want it actually done I want you 
to physically do 'em .
Right erm 
So they go into your brain
Mm.
via your eyes and and 
finger ends and so forth.
Mhm.
Okay?
Mhm.
I suppose I should put Nyah Right okay simultaneous equations.
Yeah.
With some degree of er  success I trust this time.
I think I messed number one up.
Ah dear.
Yes you did.
You know why?
No.
You made the classic mistake the only mistake there is here you multiply everything by two
Mm.
So that's twenty six.
Mm.
That's the only I mean that's th that's the real problem with this thing It's one the the difficulties you end up with You see you must remember to multiply everything that's there by the number you want to multiply, not just half of it.
And that's all the problem is.
I think I've done the others right.
Yes that looks alright.
Yeah.
Well you can always tell can't you?
How do you tell?
St st st just stick 
Go back and check it  
the numbers back in.
Just put the numbers back in.
Yeah it's alright.
Yeah it's alright.
You see you managed to  plough through these quite r readily did you?
Sort of.
Ah.
What on earth's that question?
Two A plus
Oh it's an A is it?
Oh I beg your pardon sorry
I changed it to  .
That's al that's alright that's alright I'm with that.
I understand what you're doing it's a substitution.
It's a little like As and Bs.
Er it doesn't make any difference does it?
No but I'm used to Xs and Ys.
Yes but A Yeah that's alright erm except for examples  we where do up to?
Ten.
Up to ten.
Yes.
Have a go at fourteen and sixteen.
Whilst I sit here and admire your expertise and 
Ha.
general  facility at this subject.
Mm.
And say to yourself
Nine seven nine C plus 
Yep.
Or four Y minus minus nine.
Yeah.
Which is probably as good.
Thirteen.
Thirteen is right.
twenty six 
That's okay.
Y equals 
Y equals  What're you gonna do?
Divide it.
Yeah, whoa.
Right it's two isn't it?
Mm.
Okay.
Substitute that back in .
Yes that's right.
Yes.
Do number seventeen.
But I haven't done sixteen.
Just do number seventeen I fancy seventeen better than number sixteen.
Mhm, you would.
I know.
I have this great in-built desire to make people suffer.
There's an easier way of doing it isn't there?
What get rid of the Ys?
Yes.
Mm.
Suppose so.
Yeah there is is There's an awful lot of suppose so about that you only gonna do one set of calculations rather than two aren't you?
Yeah.
You must look at this from the minimum of Point of view of the minimum amount of labour.
Yeah.
Equals twenty six.
No it doesn't.
I beg your pardon yes it does..
Mm.
Yes it does.
You're right.
That's right.
and X equals 
Thirty three.
Yeah.
Alright we  need to bother a I know you I know you can do substitution.
Yeah thing about it is though when you're looking at this, you wanna be looking as to which is the Produces the smallest numbers.
mm.
And which produces the minimum amount of manipulation and that was that the second one wasn't it?
Yeah.
You had much less to do than anything else.
Mm.
Right that's unfortunate.
That I l I've forgotten to bring the other work.
However.
Can I Can I just interrupt and say I've forgotten .
I'm sorry is that enough?
Yes.
thank you.
Eye's funny.
Yeah.
Now look it asks you for a certain number of things It says As The average doesn't it?
How 
Yes.
Do you work t an average?
Average is all the tests added together
Yeah,
divide by the number of tests he had.
That's right.
So what's the total for all his test?
Hundred and twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six how many tests had he had?
X.
X.
So the average is going to be?
Hundred and twenty five divide by x.
Hundred an Is it a hundred and twenty five?
twenty six.
Hundred and twenty six divided by X is that.
Yeah.
So what's difficult about that?
Nothing.
So.
Now there's another two tests.
Yeah.
So what's the total now?
Hundred and twenty eight  divide by
Where's a hundred and twenty eight come from?
What's the total marks for the next two tests?
Oh.
You're told what the marks are for the next two tests aren 
Oh nine and eight.
Nine and eight aren't they?
Yeah.
So what's the total marks for the Now for the the tests?
How many marks you got all together?
Hundred and   twenty thirty  forty   forty two .
Mm.
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
No!
What's a hundred and twenty six plus nine?
Come on what's nine add six ?
Hundred and thirty six.
O What's nine add six?
Eleven.
Nine add six?
Oh  Fourteen.
And another one.
Six 
fifteen yeah?
Yes.
Six and nine it's always one less when innit when you're adding nine?
So it's fifteen do it's a hundred and twenty six plus nine is?
hundred and thirty forty.
I want a hundred and twenty six plus nine!
Oh a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty  five.
Hundred and thirty five.
What's five and eight?
Not
Thirteen.
Thirteen so the answer's gonna be a hundred and?
Forty three.
Hundred and forty three.
You know what the a en end number's gonna be every time i Don't you?
Yeah.
Mm.
Hundred and forty three.
That's right so the total's a hundred and forty three.
So what's the what's the average gonna be or even the mean?
Hundred and forty three  divide by 
By 
X plus two.
Splendid.
Can we have it written down like real mathematicians?
Ah wonderful.
Wonderful.
hundred and forty five.
Yes No I said a hundred and forty 
Forty three 
three yes.
Over 
Divide by X plus two .
plus two that's right.
Now what's the next part of the question say?
If if a If his average for the first X test was one greater than his average for
X plus two tests .
plus two tests .
Use results of one and two 
To form the equation and find the value of X. 
Now what it just said  think of another way of saying that.
Work out what X is.
No you can't work out what X is you haven't got a c hope of working out wh 
Form an equation.
Form an equation.
But what's one side of the equation going to be?
Hundred and twenty six divide by X.
Plus?
Hundred and fort 
No no
plus two
No no read what it says.
If his average for the first X tests is one greater than the average  Sorry beg your pardon I've got it round me  round me neck.
If his average for the first X t is one greater than his average for the X plus two tests   So a hundred and twenty six over X is gonna equal?
What he got in the first
O in the second lot  isn't it?
Plus one.
Mm.
Yes.
So right it down.
Yeah come on!
Just write it down!
Hundred and twen 
What?
What I've just told you hundred and twenty six over X is equal?
Hundred and forty three 
Three 
divide by X plus two
Yeah.
Plus one.
Yes.
Plus one.
Why is it plus one there?
Cos it's says it's This is one more than that isn't it?
This is one more than that.
So shouldn't that be plus one?
How do you make them equal?
Oh yeah.
Yes think about it carefully.
How do you make them equal.
Mm.
That's right so.
Now what are you going to do?
Find the value of X.
I'm an extremely patient soul as you well know,but if you say Find the value of X to me again How are you gonna  find the value of X?
What do you intend to do?
Get rid of the denominators.
Get rid of the denominators, good.
Well done.
Go on then.
Is that right?
No.
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
Timesing it by X.
Alright then times it by X.
Go on then if that's what you're doing go on.
Keep going!
Hold on a minute you've still got a this on the bottom haven't you?
To start with come on.
Cos your multiplying by X go on you haven't cancelled it yet go on.
Carry on.
Eh?
What are you doing?
You can't do that!
Why?
Multiply everything by X go on.
Ju just do every term you've got multiply it by X.
Go on.
I don't know how to do it though.
Course you do!
Just carry on multiplying things by X instead of trying to jump to conclusions.
Where's the two X come from?
Times it by 
But you've got that over th on the bottom haven't you?
It's X plus two there, isn't it?
It's got nothing to do when multiplying You're multiplying the top by X go on.
That's better.
That's right perfect.
Go on then, get some stuff cancelled out.
That's right.
No.
There's no way you can do that.
But I've got an X on the top.
Aye but you've got an X plus two on the bottom.
So if I put X minus two on the top?
No it will not cancel.
Why not?
You've got a hundred and forty three X over X plus two, haven't you?
Hundred and forty three minus two.
Hundred and forty does not work.
There's no way that works at all.
Just do what you've got there.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
Write a hundred and twenty six.
That's right, equals.
Hundred and forty three X over  X plus two.
That's right.
Plus X.
That's perfect now what are you going to do?
Can I move across That across to this side?
You can multiply everything through by X plus two, yes.
Go on.
Bracket, X plus two never mind about this s Mm.
Equals  that plus  Come on you're multiplying by X plus two.
No  you're multiplying by X plus two.
You've missed a You've now dropped a plus sign out haven't you?
And you've dropped an X out.
Why?
You're multiplying this term by X plus two aren't you?
You're 
Mm.
gonna multiply everything by X plus X plus two.
It just so happens that if multiply this term by X plus two you get rid of the X plus two at the bottom don't you?
Mm.
But everything there It's the same thing as when you were doing this.
The simultaneous equations wasn't it?
Why was it?
You had to me s make sure that you multiply every term out, haven't you?
Yeah.
So here you've got to multiply every term out.
Do not forget that that is a term on its own it's got n connected to this yet.
No.
You're a very very careful about that so start getting it tidied up then.
Expand the brackets I think is probably the best thing.
Hundred and twenty six X 
S X that's right.
Plus two hundred and fifty two.
Equals
Hundred and forty three X 
X 
Plus
X squared  
X squared plus two X.
That's right.
Right now things are getting a bit better aren't they?
Come on!
What're you gonna do now?
Do all the Xs on one side.
Well I'd collect the things together that were the same for a start I think.
What d'you mean?
Well you've got some Xs to collect together haven't you?
Oh.
Mm?
That's better.
That's simplified it.
Yeah.
Now s You can start you've still gotta get the every I would get everything over to one side of the equals sign.
Why?
What's this ?
Then use your quadratic  .
This is a quadratic isn't it?
Yes good.
Does it matter which way you put it?
Well I always like to read it from left to right but it doesn't matter really.
Yeah but I mean
you can do that if you want to.
I would have put all the  the er
Hundred and forty five X minus hundred and twenty six X .
Yes.
Plus x squared  minus two five two 
Minus two five two.
Equals nothing.
Yes.
So that's going to be 
Don't look at me like that!
Nineteen X.
Mhm.
Plus X squared.
Yeah.
Minus two five two .
minus two five two Equals nothing .
Equals nothing that's right.
Now if you're gonna do this you really want it in the form of X squared first don't you?really to make it To make  the thing easy to work, aren't you?
Well that's gonna be your A.
Yeah it is.
B and that's gonna be C .
It's much be It's much better to see it as A square As X squared plus te nineteen X plus minus two two five, really.
Two five two equals nothing.
Right.
Formula.
I don't know.
You're gonna have some tremendously large numbers if you work the formula aren't you?
Yes.
I mean B squared's nineteen squares you know just under four hundred isn't it?
That's twenty times twenty.
You imagine four times that.
A lot.
It's a lot isn't it?
But they're only numbers.
that's true.
But perhaps it's easier I wonder what are other factors of two hundred and fifty two?
One.
One and two hundred and fifty two, yes very good yes.
Two.
Yes good.
We want a difference of nineteen somewhere don't we?
That's easy.
We drop the calculator everywhere.
Well you can drop the calculator if you want it would be better if you pick 'em up and stick the  numbers in.
How're you gonna do?
Two hundred and fifty two divide by nineteen.
What you got?
Thirteen point two six three one five 
Yes.
seven nine eight.
Yes.
I don't think that's right.
Try the square root of two five two.
Fifteen point eight seven four five  
Yes yes ,a difference.
Don't know  does sixteen go into it just try sixteen into two five two.
Fifteen point seven five.
So we want something like erm  Seven and sixteen, well that doesn't work Sorry seven and twenty six.
Is that right?
No.
How about
No, gives a difference of nineteen.
Use the formula then, we're just sitting here wasting time.
Minus nineteen  or minus B plus or minus the square root of B 
Minus B 
Plus or minus
plus or minus the square root of 
the square root of B squared
plus 
No.
Minus 
Minus two B C
Minus four A C
Four A C
All over
Two A.
Two A is right.
So what's A?
It's an X!
Must be true.
Yes.
I am delighted you agree.
Yeah.
Minus nineteen
Yes.
plus or minus
The square root of nineteen squared minus four times 
nineteen squared minus four times 
one
one
times 
times two
No It's not times two five minus two five two .
times minus two five two 
Lovely.
All over 
Over two
Two times one.
Yep.
X squared.
X equals not X squared.
Minus nineteen  plus or minus 
plus or minus Can I do that 
Root 
all in one?
Yeah!
I can do it on here, oops!
Hope so.
Square root of nineteen squared minus four times times minus 
Minus 
two five two.
Answer.
Nineteen squared's three hundred and ninety ninety one I think.
Mm.
Three hundred and sixty one.
Really?
Three sixty one times  eight thousand There's summat wrong.
Nineteen squared minus four times one 
No it's minus It's plus It's nineteen squared plus eight  nought  one nought nought eight.
Mm.
Four time two five two.
Two hundred and fifty times four is a thousand Two hundred and fift 
It's minus!
It's minus times a minus  Isn't it?
Four
four times two th two five two is one thousand and eight isn't it?
Yes.
Two fifty times four is a thousand.
So two five two times four is t one thousand and eight, plus three hundred and chunkety chunk Three hundred and sixty one.
Mm.
Which is one three six nine.
That's more like it.
Yeah but what about mm.
above answer.
Mm.
What about that?
Where do  get that from?
Because what you did was you did er nineteen squared
Yes.
minus four.
I don't know why I don't how that works 
Would that be in brackets?
Of course it is.
I didn't put a brackets there.
Well you would have to although I would have though it might have worked algebraically that's certainly wrong though.
What did we say?
One three six  nine .
Nine.
One three six nine, yes.
All over 
Er you want the square root of that.
that's it all over two.
Two.
Yep, so it's minus nineteen plus or minus 
Plus or minus 
root one three six nine.
Square root 
One three six nine.
That's interesting.
Ah!
Yes go on.
Yeah it is isn't it?
Yes.
Go on then.
You'll remember that.
I will.
Thirty seven.
So the f One answer is f fourteen 
Don't!
Just don't!
It's not actually.
One answer's nine innit?
Minus nought point five?
Yeah.
And the other answer is?
Can you tell me how managed to produce nought point five, how you managed to produce  that?
Don't know.
Minus nineteen plus thirty seven without the aid of a calculator  must be about eighteen mustn't it?
Mm.
The difference between thirty seven and nineteen's about eighteen innit?
Approximately?
Divide that by two, answer?
Nine.
Nine.
Mm.
Engage brain  Th You must regard a calculator 
with the greatest and gravest of suspicion.
Cos it's not actually working algebraic that calculator at the present moment I don't know what you've got it programmed in What you've got it at but it's not working algebraic.
Now it might work.
No unless we have to Minus nineteen minus thirty seven divide by two minus twenty eight?
Yeah that's better.
I wonder if  minus.
Wait you've got minus fifty six haven't you here? this is minus fifty six if you use your brain.
And divided by two is minus twenty eight.
Yeah.
Yes minus twenty eight.
Now if you You take the difference between nineteen and thirty seven you get the answer eighteen don't you?
Yes.
You divide that by two you get the answer nine .
Nine.
Mm.
But why isn't my calculator working?
Because you haven't got it in the correct mode it's not working algebraic.
Which is in what function?
Who knows what your calculator and that's a such a wonderful piece of work that.
Yeah but  
Scie Scientific or You want it in scientific mode if it says scientific
Yeah it does.
In that case use it in scientific and then it will work that way.
Will it?
Yeah well it should do.
Anyway.
.
Okay.
Let's read the second part of this question cos it's taken us er quite some time to do it but excellent question.
Hasn't it 
Right 
Right let's read the second part of this.
It has an average of thirteen point five marks for the first X plus one tests.
His mark on the last test gave him a final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
What was his marks for the last test.
How do you work out his total marks for his X plus one tests.
Thirteen point five divided by X plus one.
That's his No no you've got his average as thirteen point five haven't you?
How do you work out his total marks which is what we're really looking for?
Times X plus
Yes, it's thirteen point five times X plus one.
And how do you work out his total marks for his X plus two tests?
Fourteen times thirteen plus two.
No no no.
Why?
Fourteen times what?
Times X plus  two.
Yeah.
That's what I said!
Was it?
I'm sorry I misheard you.
So what it's alright.
Mm.
I misheard you okay?
Mm.
So, it might be a good idea to write that down and work it out.
Thirteen point five
Yes
times
Will you stop doing that!
What?
That!
What's wrong with it?
How do you write a multiplication in algebra?
You're gonna multiply that by X plus one aren't you?
Mm.
How do you write that?
Hundred and thirty five X plus one.
Bracket.
X plus one.
X plus one.
Ha?
Suppose so.
That's how you write it.
Minus fourteen
Never mind about this silliness, that 
you've been allowed to get away with.
Right go and work them out then.
Thirteen point five times one is?
Thirteen point five innit?
Yeah.
Mm.
That's right.
Okay.
So what's your total marks?
Sorry what's the difference?
Fourteen point five.
You know what he total mark for  his X plus one test was don't you?
Mm.
And you know the total mark was X plus two tests.
It actually asks you for the mark he obtained for his final tests doesn't it?
Yeah.
So if you take two away, one from the other, you'll have the mark
Nought point five.
for his test won't you?
So you'll have nought point five X plus?
Plus 
Point about it is y you can't see it, can you unless you've got it written down so write it down.
it's thirteen well it's fourteen X isn't it?
Mm.
Plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Or minus thirteen X plus thirteen point five isn't it?
Why is it?
Well you're taking the difference between the two aren't you?
So don't you just minus them?
Yeah.
So that's fourteen X plus twenty eight minus thirteen point five X minus thirteen point five isn't it?
Yes?
Mm.
So that's nought point five X, now what?
Plus 
Plus what's the difference here?
Hundred and thir Hundred 
What's twenty eight minus thirteen point five?
Oh it's point five!
Yes.
What's twenty eight minus thirteen poin 
Fourteen point five.
Fourteen point five.
Okay.
So wouldn't 
That's 
you times it by two?
Another student has his average as thirteen point five marks for the first blah blah blah, right.
Which marks for the last test give a final average of fourteen marks for   So the one test is gonna give him that isn't it?
That's right you agree isn't it?
That's his total marks for X plus one tests, is there.
Total marks for S plus plus two tests is there.
The actual mark  is that.
That's for his nought  nought point five X.
So to get those two up to one X  
up to one X you should times by two which is twenty nine.
Which I don't believe.
Well do you times it by four?
No give   but his mark on his last test gave him the final average of fourteen marks for X plus two tests.
So that's his total there and his total there.
Yes it's gonna be doubled hasn't it to give you that?
Oh!
Oh dear!
How daft can you get?
What's the value of X?
W we worked that out somewhere didn't we?
We did didn't we?
Oh!
Oh!
Nearly as bad as .
Dear oh dear!
Eh?
Oh.
Innit?
I'm very tired .
So what do you do?
Times thirteen point five X by
Well you do thirteen point five times ten if you want.
Yes.
And fourteen times eleven.
Why eleven?
Well nine plus two is eleven isn't it?
Yes.
Hundred and fifty four.
Now who is being dormant?
And you've got it haven't you?
Then you find the difference?
Yes.
That makes sense.
actually work here hasn't it?
Does that give you the same answer?
Yes it should do.
Let's just check it go on.
You had thirteen point five times ten which I think is a hundred and thirty five in normal circumstances.
Yes.
And a hundred and f fourteen times eleven.
Go on it's a hundred and fifty four.
Minus nineteen.
No minus a hundred and thirty five.
One fifty four minus hundred and thirty five.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
Which is wh what we would have done if we'd done 
If we'd done 
that better.
Yeah but it we it's a spurious argument because you've got nought point five X haven't you?
Yeah.
Nought point five X i Nought point five of X i is four point five isn't it/
Yeah.
Four point five plus fourteen point five  Answer?
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
We actually got it right both ways.
But it would have been simpler to have done it that way I think.
And quicker.
And quicker.
But not as entertaining.
Yes.
Not as entertaining.
Mm.
If you like.
Yes.
They have a tendency to ask questions not quite as comp Not quite as  abstract as that.
Intricate.
Not even intric Not quite as abstract cos th the the tendency is to ask the question The average weight of nine people is whatever it is, you know somebody else has added 
Yeah  questions.
Yeah yeah.
Rather than quite as abstract as that But you can cope with abstract as that you can do A level.
Yeah.
You have to cope 
You have to  You have to be as abstract as that.
Which will not do you any harm.
Good.
A man bought three box of Dutch cigars.
Good lord how appalling in this day and age!
Three boxes!
At X pence per box, and two boxes of Havana cigars  at Y pence per box.
Calculate terms of X and Y 
Cost of the five boxes.
So what's the cost of the Dutch ones?
How many boxes?
Three X.
Splendid.
What's the cost of the Havanas?
Two Y.
So what's the total cost?
“I don’t think he’d be apt to set up a claim, without he was a pretty mean man,” said the deacon.
“Not even if ’twas Squire Peternot?” said Mr. Pipkin. “Guess he’d put in for his share, if there was any chance o’ gittin’ on ’t!”
“Nonsense, Pippy! If ’twas a large sum, he might, but a trifle like this,—you’re unjust to the squire, Pippy.”
“I haven’t said it was the squire’s land. But suppose it _was_? And suppose it had been a large sum,” queried Jack, “could he claim it? What’s the law?” And, to explain away his extraordinary interest in the legal point, he added, laughingly, “Just for the fun of it, I’d like to know what he _could_ do if he _should_ try Phin’s joke, and set out to get my half-dollar away!”
“I really don’t know about the law,” the deacon was saying, when Lion barked. “Hist! here comes Peternot himself! Say nothing. I’ll ask him. He’s bringing his nephew over to see us.”
“He’s kind of adopted his nephew, hain’t he, sence he heard of his son’s death?” said Mr. Pipkin. “I’ve seen him hangin’ around there.”
“No; he only wants to get him into our school next winter.”
“Ho! a schoolmaster!” whispered Phin, jeering at the new-comer. “Say, Jack! I bet we can lick him!”
“Don’t look as if he had any more backbone ’n a spring chicken,” was Mr. Pipkin’s unfavorable criticism, as the gaunt and limping squire came to the door with his young relative.
“Good afternoon, neighbor,” said the deacon, shaking hands first with the uncle, then with the nephew. “You’ve come just at the right time. We’ve a legal question to settle. Suppose Jack, here, finds a purse of money on my place; no owner turns up; now whose purse is it, Jack’s or mine?”
“Your land—your hired boy—I should say, your purse,” said the squire, emphatically.
“But suppose _you_ find such a purse on my land?”
“H’m! that alters the case. How is it, Byron? My nephew is studying law; he can tell you better than I can about it.”
Peternot thought this a good chance to bring the candidate for the winter’s school into favorable notice; and the candidate for the winter’s school made the most of his opportunity. He was a slender young man with a sallow complexion, a greenish eye, a pimpled forehead, and a rather awkward and studied manner of speaking. In rendering his opinion he was as prolix as any judge on the bench. He began with a disquisition on the nature of law, and finally, coming down to the case in point, said it would be considered a case of treasure-trove.
“What’s that?” Jack eagerly interrupted him.
“Treasure-trove is treasure found.”
“Then why don’t they say treasure found?”
“’Sh, boy!” said Mr. Chatford, good-naturedly, smiling at the youngster’s impatience of long-winded sentences and large words. “What’s the law of—treasure-trove, I believe you call it, Mr. Dinks?”
“I don’t think there’s any law on the subject,” replied the student of Blackstone, picking his teeth with a straw.
“No law! then how can such a case be decided?”
“Custom, which makes a sort of unwritten law, would here come in.”
“Well, what’s the custom?”
Thereupon Mr. Byron Dinks became prolix again, speaking of English custom, which, like English law, creates precedents for our own country. The meaning of his discourse, stripped of its technical phrases and tedious repetitions, seemed to be, that formerly, treasure-trove went to the crown; that in more modern times it was divided—in a case like this—between the finder and the man on whose premises it was found; but that he didn’t think any precedent had been established in America.
“We’re about as wise now as we were before,” remarked Phin’s elder brother Moses, standing in the kitchen door.
Mr. Chatford gave him a wink to remain silent, and said, “How are we to understand you, Mr. Dinks? To use your own expression, A finds money on B’s premises; now what would be your advice to B?”
“Supposing B is my client? I should advise him to get possession of the money, if he could. Possession is nine points of the law.”
“Well, but if he couldn’t get possession?”
“Then try to compromise for one half. Then for a quarter. Then for what he could get.”
“Very good. Now what would be your advice to A?”
“A is my client?”
“Yes, we’ll suppose so.”
Spitting and throwing away his straw, Mr. Byron Dinks said with a laugh, “My advice to A would be to pocket the money and say nothing about it; keep possession, any way; fight for it.”
“Thank you,” said the deacon, with quiet irony in his tones. “Now we know what the law is on this subject, boys.”
“I don’t see, for my part, that it differs very much from common sense,” remarked the simple-minded Mr. Pipkin, “only it takes more words to git at it.”
“I’m sure,” said the squire, “my nephew has given you all the law there is to govern such cases, and good advice to his clients. ’T ain’t his fault if people can’t understand him.”
“I guess we all understand the main point, now we’ve got at it,” said Deacon Chatford. “Hang on to your money, Jack.”
“You’ve got it,” said Jack, more deeply glad and agitated than any one suspected.
“So I have. Well, I’ll tell ye when I get home from the Basin to-night whether it’s good or not. Walk in, gentlemen.”
And the deacon entered the house with his guests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER IV
IN WHICH JACK COUNTS HIS CHICKENS.
PETERNOT and his nephew took their departure, after making a short call. Then the family sat down to the supper-table, and the merits and prospects of the candidate for the winter’s school were discussed in a manner that ought to have made his ears tingle. Then, while the boys harnessed the mare and brought her to the door, the deacon changed his clothes, and at last started for the Basin.
“Don’t forget to ask about that half-dollar!” said Jack, as he held the gate open for the buggy to pass through.
“Glad you reminded me of it,—I _should_ have forgotten it,” replied the notoriously absent-minded deacon.
Jack wished he could have found some excuse for going with him, but he could not think of any.
“How can I wait till he gets back, to know about it?” thought he, as he stood at the gate and watched the buggy and Mr. Chatford’s black hat disappear over the brow of the hill.
His revery was interrupted by Moses, who, noticing the boy’s unusual conduct,—for Jack was ordinarily no dreamer when there was work to be done,—called out to him from the stable-door, “Say, Jack! you’ve got to go and fetch the cows to-night; Phin says he won’t.”
“It’s Phin’s turn,—but I don’t care, I’ll go.” And Jack set off for the pasture, glad of this opportunity to be alone, and to muse upon his wonderful discovery.
It was a beautiful evening. The air was fresh and cool, and perfectly delicious after the shower. The sky overhead was silver-clear, but all down the gorgeous west, banks and cliffs and floating bars of cloud burned with the hues of sunset. Jack’s heart expanded, as he walked up the lane; and there, in that lovely atmosphere, he built his airy castles.
“If I _am_ a rich man,” thought he, “what shall I do with my money? I’ll put it out at interest for a year or two,—I wonder how much there is! That’ll help me get an education. Then I’ll go into business, or buy a little place somewhere, and I’ll have my horses and wagons and hired men, and—” O, what a vision of happiness floated before his eyes! riches, honors, friendships, and in the midst of all the sweetest face in the world,—the face of his dearest friend, Mrs. Chatford’s niece, Annie Felton.
Then he looked back wonderingly upon his past life. “I can hardly believe that I was nothing but a mean, ragged, swearing little canal-driver only a few months ago. Over yonder are the woods where the charcoal-burners were, that I wanted to hire out to, after I had run away from the scow,—the idea of my hiring out to them! Now here I am, treated like one of Mr. Chatford’s own boys, and—with all that money, if it is money,” he added, his heart swelling again with misgivings. “Go, Lion! go for the cows,” he said; and he himself began to run, calling by the way, “Co’, boss! co’, boss!” as if bringing the cows would also bring Mr. Chatford home, with his report concerning the half-dollar.
“He won’t be there, though, for an hour or two yet,” he reflected. “What’s the use of hurrying? I shall only have the longer to wait. I wonder if that log is just as I left it!” For Jack had still a secret dread lest the unknown person who had hidden the treasure so many years ago should now suddenly return and carry it away. “I’ll cut over there and take just one peep,” he said.
So, having started the cattle upon their homeward track, with Lion barking after the laggards, Jack leaped a fence, ran across the lot where he had been at work that afternoon with Mr. Pipkin and Phin when the shower surprised them, and was soon standing alone by the log in the darkening woods. The sticks which he had stuffed into the end of the hollow trunk were all in their place. And yet it seemed a dream to Jack, that he had actually found a box of money in that old tree,—that it was there now! He wanted to pull out the sticks and go in and make sure of his prize, but forbore to do so foolish a thing.
“Of course it’s there,” thought he. “And I’m going to take care that nobody knows where it is, till I’ve got it safe in my own possession; then who can say whether I found it on Mr. Chatford’s, or Squire Peternot’s, or Aunt Patsy’s land, if I don’t tell? Let Squire Peternot claim it if he can!”
Yet Jack longed to tell somebody of his discovery. “O, if I could only tell Annie Felton, and get her advice about it!” But Annie, who taught the summer school, and “boarded around,” was just then boarding in a distant part of the district. The next day, however, was Saturday; then she would come home to her aunt’s to spend the Sunday, and he could impart to her his burning secret.
Jack stayed but a minute in the woods, then, hurrying back, rejoined Lion, who was driving the cows into the lane. Arrived at the barn-yard, he took one of three or four pails which Mr. Pipkin had brought out from the pantry, and a stool from the shed, and sat down to do his share of the milking. He had always liked that part of the day’s work well enough before; but now with a secret feeling of pride and hope he said to himself, “Maybe I sha’n’t always be obliged to do this for a living!” And he wondered how it would seem to be a gentleman and live without work.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER V
WAITING FOR THE DEACON.
THE milk was carried to the pantry and strained; the candles were lighted, and the family sat in a pleasant circle about the kitchen table, while, without, the twilight darkened into night, and the crickets sang. There was Mr. Pipkin showing Phin how to braid a belly into his woodchuck-skin whiplash; Mrs. Pipkin (late Miss Wansey) paring a pan of apples, which she held in her lap; Moses reading the “Saturday Courier,” a popular story-paper in those days; little Kate, sitting on a stool, piecing a bed-quilt under her mother’s eye,—sewing together squares of different colored prints cut out from old dresses, and occasionally looking up to ask the maternal advice,—while Mrs. Chatford was doing some patch-work of a different sort, which certain rents in Phin’s trousers rendered necessary. Jack sat in the corner, silent, and listening for buggy-wheels.
“I hope you won’t go climbing over the buckles and hames, on to a horse’s back, in that harum-scarum way, another time,” said the good woman, in tones of mild reproof, to her younger son.
“’T was beginning to rain, and I couldn’t stop to think,” said Phin, laughing. “Could I, Phi?”
“I should think not, by the hurry you was in to hook my ride,” replied Mr. Pipkin, with reviving resentment. “That was a mean trick; and now jes’ see how I’m payin’ ye for it! Ye never could ’a’ got a decent-lookin’ belly into this lash, in the world, if ’twa’n’t for me.”
“That’s ’cause you’re such a good feller, and know so much!” said Phin, who could resort to flattery when anything was to be gained by it. “O, look, Mose! ain’t Phi doing it splendid? It’s going to be the best whiplash ever you set eyes on.”
Mr. Pipkin’s lips tightened in a grin around his big front teeth, and he worked harder than ever drawing the strands over the taper belly, while Phin, leaning over the back of his chair, whispered to Jack, “See what a fool I can make of him!”
At that Mrs. Pipkin, who had a keen ear and a sharp temper, flared up.
“Mr. Pipkin!”
“What, Mis’ Pipkin?”—meekly.
“You’ve worked long enough on that whiplash. He’s making fun of ye; and that’s all the thanks you’ll ever get for helping him. Take hold here and pare these apples while I slice ’em up.”
“In a minute. I can’t le’ go here jes’ now,” said Mr. Pipkin.
Whereupon Mrs. Pipkin laid down her knife and the apple she was paring, and looked at her husband over the rim of the pan in perfect astonishment.
“Mr. Pipkin! did you hear my request?”
“Yes, I heerd ye, but—”
“Mr. Pipkin,” interrupted Mrs. Pipkin, severely, “_will_ you have the kindness to pare these apples? I don’t wish to be obliged to speak again!”
“What’s the apples fer,—sass?” said Mr. Pipkin, mildly.
“Pies; and you know you’re as fond of pies as anybody, Mr. Pipkin.”
“Wal, so I be, _your_ pies. I declare, you do beat the Dutch with your apple-pies, if I do say it. There, Phin, I guess you can go along with the belly now. If it’s for pies, I’ll pare till the cows come hum!”
Thus disguising his obedience to his wife’s request, Mr. Pipkin took the pan and the knife, and Mrs. Pipkin recovered from her astonishment.
“Jack might pare the apples and let Phi braid!” Phin complained, getting into difficulties with his whiplash. “Darn this old belly!” And he flung it across the room.
“Phineas! you shall go to bed if I hear any more such talk,” said Mrs. Chatford, as sternly as it was in her kind motherly nature to speak. Then looking at Jack in the corner, “How happens it you are not reading your book to-night? It’s something new for you to be idle.”
“O, I don’t feel much like reading to-night,” said Jack, whose heart was where his treasure was.
“He’s thinking about his half-dollar, waiting to know if it’s a good one,” sneered Phin.
“Shouldn’t wonder if that half-dollar had dropped out of old Daddy Cobb’s money-box,” remarked Mr. Pipkin, taking a slice of apple.
“Mr. Pipkin! these apples are for pies!” said Mrs. Pipkin, in a warning voice.
“Daddy Cobb’s money-box! what’s that?” faltered Jack, fearing he had found an owner to the coin.
“What! didn’t ye never hear tell about Daddy Cobb’s diggin’ for a chist o’ treasure? Thought everybody’d heerd o’ that. There’s some kind o’ magic about it, hanged if I can explain jest what. The chist has a habit o’ shiftin’ its hidin’-place in the ground, so that though Daddy’s a’most got holt on ’t five or six times, it has allers slipped away from him in the most onaccountable and aggravatin’ manner. He has a way o’ findin’ where it is, by some hocus-pocus, hazel-wands for one thing; then he goes with his party of diggers at night,—for there’s two or three more fools big as him,—and they make a circle round the place, and one reads the Bible and holds the lantern while the rest dig, and if nobody speaks or does anything to break the charm, there’s a chance ’at they may git the treasure. Once Daddy says they had actooally got a holt on’t,—a big, square iron chist,—but jest’s they was liftin’ on’t out he jammed his finger, and said ‘Oh!’ and by hokey! if it didn’t disappear right afore their face an’ eyes quicker ’n a flash o’ lightnin’!”
Jack listened intently to this story. He did not believe that his treasure was the one Daddy Cobb had been digging for so long, but might it not elude his grasp in the same way?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VI
“ABOUT THAT HALF-DOLLAR.”
AT every sound of wheels Jack started; and more than once he imagined he heard a wagon stop at the gate. Still no deacon; would he never return? Jack watched the clock, and thought he had never seen the pointers move so slowly.
Three or four times he went to the door to listen; and at last he walked down to the gate. It was bright, still moonlight, only the crickets and katydids were singing, and now and then an owl hooted in the woods or a raccoon cried.
“There’s a buggy coming!” exclaimed Jack. He could hear it in the distance; he could see it dimly coming down the moonlit road. “It’s Mr. Chatford!” He knew the deacon’s peculiar “_Ca dep!_” (get up) to the horse.
“That you, Jack?” said the deacon, driving in.
“Yes; thought I’d come down and shut the gate after you,” replied Jack.
Mr. Chatford stopped at the house, and Jack ran to help him take out some bundles. Then the deacon drove on to the barn, and Jack hurried after him. Still not a word about the half-dollar.
“You can go into the house; I’ll take care of Dolly,” said Jack.
“I’ll help; ’t won’t take but a minute,” said Mr. Chatford. “I’ve got bad news for you.”
“Have you?” said Jack, with sudden faintness of heart. “What?”
“For you and Lion,” added the deacon. “Duffer’s got another dog. He made his brags of him to-night. Said he could whip any dog in seven counties.”
“He’d better not let him tackle Lion!” said Jack.
“I told him I hoped he wouldn’t kill sheep, as his other dog did. Take her out of the shafts; we’ll run the buggy in by hand.”
The broad door of the horse-barn stood open. Jack led the mare up into the bright square of moonshine which lay on the dusty floor. There the harness was quickly taken off. Not a word yet concerning the half-dollar, which Jack was ashamed to appear anxious about, and which he began to think Mr. Chatford, with characteristic absent-mindedness, had forgotten.
“By the way, I’ve good news for you!” suddenly exclaimed the deacon.
Jack’s heart bounded. “Have you?”
“I saw Annie over at the Basin. She wants to go home to her folks to-morrow. Would you like to drive her over? She spoke of it.”
“And stay till Monday?” said Jack, to whom this would indeed have been good news at another time.
“Yes; start early, and get back Monday morning in time for her to begin school. Then she won’t go home again till her summer term is out.”
“Maybe—I’d better—wait and go then.” Jack felt the importance of early securing his treasure, and, having set apart Sunday afternoon for that task (“a deed of necessity,” he called it to his conscience), he saw no way but to postpone the long-anticipated happiness of a ride and visit with his dear friend. Yet what if the treasure were no treasure?
“As you please,” said the deacon, a little surprised at Jack’s choice. “Moses will be glad enough to go. See that she has plenty of hay in the rack, and don’t tie the halter so short as you do sometimes. Now give me a push here,”—taking up the buggy-shafts.
“Oh!” said Jack, as if he had just thought of something,—“I was going to ask you—about that half-dollar?”
“I didn’t think on ’t,” said Mr. Chatford, standing and holding the shafts while Jack went behind,—“not till I’d got started for home. Then I put my hand in my pocket for something, and found your half-dollar. Help me in with the buggy, and then I’ll tell you.”
The deacon drew in the shafts, Jack pushed behind, and the buggy went rattling and bounding up into its place.
“Did you go back?” asked Jack, out of breath,—not altogether from the effort he had just made.
The deacon deliberately walked out of the barn, and carefully shut and fastened the door; then, while on the way to the house, he explained.
“I had paid for my purchases out of my pocket-book, or I should have found that half-dollar before. However, as I had promised you, I whipped about and drove back to the goldsmith’s. He was just shutting up shop. I told him what I wanted. He went behind his counter, lit a lamp, looked at your half-dollar, cut into it, and then flung it into his drawer.”
“Kept it!” gasped out Jack.
“Yes; ’t was as good a half-dollar as ever came from the mint, he said. He gave me another in its place.”
Jack could not utter a word in reply to this announcement, which, notwithstanding his utmost hopes, astonished and overjoyed him beyond measure. As soon as he had recovered a little of his breath and self-possession, he grasped the deacon’s arm, and was on the point of exclaiming, “O Mr. Chatford! I have found a trunk full of just such half-dollars as that!”—for he felt that he must tell his joy to some one, and to whom else should he go? But already the deacon’s other hand was on the latch of the kitchen door, which he opened; and there sat the family round the table within.
“What is it, my boy?” said Mr. Chatford, as Jack shrank back and remained silent. “Oh! you want your half-dollar. Of course!” putting his hand into his pocket.
“I don’t care anything about _that_,” said Jack. He took it, nevertheless,—a bright, clean half-dollar in place of the scratched and tarnished coin he had given Mr. Chatford that afternoon.
Mr. Chatford stood holding the door open.
“Ain’t you coming in?”
“No, sir,—not just yet.”
Jack felt that he must be alone with his great, joyful, throbbing thoughts for a little while; and he wandered away in the moonlit night.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VII
HOW JACK WENT FOR HIS TREASURE.
IN the forenoon of the following day Annie Felton dismissed her little school half an hour earlier than she was accustomed to do, and went to her Aunt Chatford’s house, to dine with her relatives and prepare for the long afternoon’s ride. She was greatly surprised when told that Jack was not to accompany her.
“Did Uncle Chatford speak to him about it?” she inquired of her aunt.
“Yes, but for some reason he didn’t seem inclined to go. That just suited Moses; he was glad enough of the chance.”
“Jack has found a half-dollar, and it has just about turned his head,” remarked Mrs. Pipkin.
“A half-dollar?” repeated Annie, wondering if such a trifle could indeed have so affected her young friend. No, she could not believe it. Then why had he willingly let slip an opportunity which she had thought he would be eager to seize?
Soon the men and boys came in to dinner,—Moses in high spirits, and with his Sunday clothes on; Jack jealous and unhappy.
“Why didn’t I leave _that_ till another Sunday? or get it one of these moonlight nights?” he said to smile, and moved her lips with some sweet, inaudible meaning as she passed him; but Moses, good fellow though he was, cast upon him a look of contempt, and flourished his whip, driving proudly away beside his beautiful cousin.
[Illustration: “IT’S A GREAT SECRET.”]
Jack, much as he thought of his hidden treasure, now for the first time in his life felt the utter worthlessness of money compared with the good-will and companionship of those we love,—a truth which it takes some of us all our lives to discover.
The sight of Annie Felton always stirred the nobler part of his nature; and now, going back to the house, he began to blame himself for having taken hitherto a purely selfish view of his treasure.
“All I’ve thought of has been just the good it was going to do _me_!” And he said to himself that he didn’t deserve the good fortune that had befallen him. Now to bestow it all upon her he felt would be his greatest happiness.
“And give some to you, precious little Kate!” was his second thought, as the gay little creature came running with Lion to meet him. In like manner his benevolence overflowed to all,—even to sharp-tongued Mrs. Pipkin,—after Annie Felton had stirred the fountain.
Twenty-four hours seemed long to wait. But the time for securing his treasure at last came round. He walked to church in the morning with Phin and Mr. Pipkin, but, without saying a word to anybody of his intentions, he at noon came home alone across the fields. He found, as he expected, Mrs. Chatford keeping house.
“Why, Jack!” said she, “why didn’t you stay to Sunday school and the afternoon services?”
“Don’t you want to go this afternoon?” replied Jack, evasively. “There will be some of the neighbors riding by, who will carry you. I’ll take care of the house.”
“You are very kind to think of me,” she said. “But I don’t think of going. You’d better eat your luncheon, and go right back.”
Jack longed to tell her everything on the spot, but feared she might disapprove of his going to bring home the treasure on the Sabbath. “After all’s over, then she’ll say I did right,” thought he. So he remarked, carelessly, “There’s a new minister to-day; I don’t like him very well. I guess I’ll go over and see Aunt Patsy a little while this afternoon.”
“If you do, I’ll send a loaf of bread and one of the pies we baked yesterday,” said Mrs. Chatford.
This was what Jack expected; and it gave him an excuse for carrying a basket. He took off his Sunday clothes, putting on an every-day suit in their place, lunched, and soon after started with Lion. He made a brief visit to the poor woman, and then set out for home by way of the woods.
On the edge of Aunt Patsy’s wood-lot he paused and looked carefully all about him. Not a human being was in sight. A Sabbath stillness reigned over all the sunlit fields and shadowy woods. There were Squire Peternot’s cattle feeding quietly in the pasture. A hawk was sailing silently high overhead. As he turned and walked on, two or three squirrels, gray and black, ran along the ground, disappearing around the trunks of trees to reappear in the rustling tops, and it was all he could do to keep Lion still.
“Look here, old fellow!” said he, “remember, you are not to bark to-day!”
From Aunt Patsy’s wood-lot he entered the squire’s, stepping over a dilapidated fence of poles and brush. The snapping of the decayed branches broke the silence; then, as he listened, he heard, far off, the bells for the afternoon service begin to ring. It was a strange sound, in that wildwood solitude, so shadowy and cool, and full of the fresh odors of moss and fern.
The bells were still ringing, and their faint, slow, solemn toll filled Jack’s heart with an indefinable feeling of guilt as he reached the log where his treasure was, and reflected upon the very worldly business that brought him there.
He did not reflect long,—he was too eager for the exciting work before him. Having walked on to the farther edge of the woods, to see that nobody was approaching from that direction, he returned, and began to pull out the sticks which he had stuffed into the end of the log.
“Everything’s just as I left it, so far,” thought he. “Wonder if my money-chest will dodge a fellow, like old Daddy Cobb’s!”
The opening clear, he put on an old brown frock which he had brought in the basket, laid his hat and coat on the ground, told Lion to watch them, and entered the log headforemost. The treasure, too, was where he had left it. His body stopped the cavity so that he could see nothing in its depths, but his groping hand felt the little trunk and the coin that had fallen out of its broken end.
“I’ll take this loose money out of the way first,” thought he; “then maybe I can move the trunk.”
He had nothing but his pockets to put the coin into, and those his frock covered. “I’ll find something better,” thought he. Backing out of the log, he pulled off his shoes, and re-entered with one of them in his hand. This he filled with all the half-dollars he could find about the end of the trunk, which he then tried to move.
“It’s stuck in a heap of rotten stuff here,” he muttered, “and I shall break it more if I pull hard on it.” So he resolved to empty it where it was.
He was half-way out of the log, bringing after him his shoe freighted with coin, when he was startled by a sudden bark from Lion. Leaving his shoe, he tumbled himself out upon the ground in fearful haste, to find a stray calf in the bushes the innocent cause of alarm. For keeping guard too faithfully poor Lion got a box on the ear.
After waiting awhile, to see if anything more dangerous than the calf was nigh, Jack brought out his shoe, poured its rattling contents into the basket, which he covered with his coat, and then went back into the log. This time he took both shoes in with him, which he filled, and emptied one after the other into the basket. Another journey, another, and still another, and he began to think there was more coin than he could carry home.
“I can get it away from here, though, so nobody can tell on whose land I found it,”—which he seemed to think a very important point to gain. “I’ll leave the little trunk where it is,—only take out the money.”
He had gone into the log for the last time, and got the last of the money, filling both shoes quite full, and was bringing them out with him,—he had actually got them out, leaving one at the entrance to the opening, and holding the other in his hands,—when Lion, notwithstanding his previous punishment, uttered a very low, suppressed growl.
Jack looked up from under his tumbled hair, and there, not three yards distant, with his horn-headed cane, regarding with grim amazement the boy and his shoes full of coin, stood Squire Peternot!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER VIII
JACK AND THE SQUIRE.
FEARING a raid upon his melon-patch, which bad boys in the neighborhood were beginning to molest, the squire had stayed at home to watch it that Sunday afternoon. He had seen Jack with his dog and basket cross the fields, go to Aunt Patsy’s house, and afterwards enter the woods; and, feeling the interest of a stern moral censor in the conduct of all Sabbath-breaking boys, he had followed him to the hollow log. Lion’s indiscreet barking had at first served to guide him to the spot; and afterwards his equally unfortunate silence, in consequence of the punishment he had suffered for that offence, favored the old man’s stealthy approach.
To have the faintest idea of the emotions that agitated the squire at sight of Jack and the shoes full of coin,—the wrath, the surprise, the avarice,—one must have seen him as he stood there, or have heard Jack (as I have heard him many times) describe the grim and frowning figure that met his eyes.
“What’s this, what’s this, eh?” cried Peternot, taking a stride forwards. “Money! on my land!” and the gray eyes glittered. “Ha! ha! This, then, is the meaning of all that talk about _treasure-trove_ the other day!”
[Illustration: “BOY! ARE YOU A ROBBER?”]
Jack felt so stunned for the moment that he did not attempt to speak, or even to rise. He sat on the ground, guarding his shoes, keeping one hand on the rim of the basket and looking up steadily at the squire with eyes full of mingled fear and defiance.
“So, so! What have you got in your basket?” And the stiff-jointed old man stooped to remove the coat which Jack had taken the precaution to spread over it each time when he entered the log.
“Here! you just leave that alone!” exclaimed Jack, while Lion gave a fierce growl. The squire dropped the garment instantly, but he had pulled it far enough from the basket to expose its surprising contents.
“Boy!” said he, in still greater amazement, “are you a robber?”
“Like enough I am,” muttered Jack, quite willing that he should take that view of the case.
“Boy!” repeated Peternot, with awful severity, “you’ve stolen this money, and it’s my duty to have you arrested. I am a justice of the peace.” Jack changed countenance at that.
“I’ve stolen it about as much as I stole Mr. Chatford’s horse and buggy once, which you were so sure of, when they were all the while standing under the shed at the Basin, just where Mr. Chatford left them.”
“Then how did you come by so much money?”
“If you must know, I found it in this log,” said Jack, with a sudden determination to tell the plain truth, and stand or fall by it.
“How do I know but what you stole it and hid it here, so you could pretend you’d found it?”
Jack was glad now that he had not removed the trunk.
“If you can’t see by the look of this silver that it’s been hid away here longer than I’ve been in the town,” he replied, “you can just go into the log and find the trunk, that you’ll say has been there about as many years as I am old, that’s all!”
“Is there any more money in there?”
Jack was willing the squire should think there might be, nor was he sure there were not a few pieces in the rubbish about the trunk; so he said, “It belongs to me, if there is.”
“Belongs to you? You little scapegrace! By what right?”
“It belongs to me,—that is,” added Jack, “if the real owner doesn’t turn up,—because I found it.”
“Found it, on my land! You haven’t got it off from my land yet, and I forbid your taking it off. What’s left in the log you haven’t even had in your possession. I want nothing but what’s my own by a plain interpretation of law; but the law’s with me in this. If you had once fairly got the coin away without my knowledge, there might have been some question about it; but that you’ve been caught trespassing, and that you’ve no right to take anything from my premises in my presence and against my express orders, is common sense as well as common law.”
Fire and tears rushed into poor Jack’s eyes.
“And do you mean to say you’ll take all this money away from me?”
“Sartin, I do, since it don’t belong to you, not a dollar on ’t. I’ll make ye a reasonable reward, however, if you give it up without making me any unnecessary trouble.”
“What do you call a reasonable reward? Half?”
“Half! of all that money!” exclaimed the squire, in huge astonishment. “Preposterous! I’ll give ye more than liberal pay for your trouble. I’ll give ye five dollars.”
Thereupon grief and fury and fierce contempt burst from the soul of Jack. All the softening influences which had been at work upon him for the past few months were forgotten in a moment; he was the vicious, desperate, profane little canal-driver once more. Looking up through tears of rage at the startled squire, he shouted, “Go to thunder, you hoary old villain!” and followed up this charge with a volley of blasphemy and abuse, which lasted for at least a minute. By that time the squire had recovered his self-possession; so, in a measure, had Jack; and the hurricane of passion that had swept everything before it was followed by a lull of sullen hate and despair.
“That’s the kind of boy you are, is it? after all your living among Christian people!” said the old man, with a sort of grim satisfaction.
“It’s the kind of boy I was, and it’s the kind of boy such Christians as you are will make me again, if I let you!” said Jack, kindling once more. “I didn’t mean to swear, but I forgot myself. I haven’t before, since the first Sunday after I came off from the canal. That’s because I _have_ been living among Christians,—people who try to encourage a fellow and help him, by bringing out the good that’s in him, instead of grinding him down, and keeping him down, by telling him how bad he’s always been and always will be,—like the kind of Christian _you_ are!”
“Talk to me about being a Christian, you profane Sabbath-breaker!” said Peternot, choking with indignation.
“A Sabbath-breaker, am I? And what are you? I own up to what brought me here to-day, but what brought _you_ here? What keeps you here? Why ain’t you at church? Guess you consider your worldly interests worth looking after a little, if _’tis_ Sunday,—don’t you?”
“Come, come, boy! that kind of talk won’t help matters.”
“Then le’s stop it,” said Jack. “But if you come here on Sunday and try to get my money away from me, and accuse me of Sabbath-breaking because I mean to keep it, I shall have just a word to say back, you better believe!” And, still sitting on the ground, Jack held his shoes between his legs, and guarded one side of the basket, while Lion guarded the other.
“What do you want of so much money,—a boy like you?” said the squire, adopting a more conciliatory tone.
“What do you want of it,—a man like you? without a child in the world, since you drove your only son away from home by your hard treatment, and he died a drunkard and a gambler!”
The old man fairly staggered backward at this cruel blow, and uttered a suppressed groan.
“It was mean in me to say that,” added Jack, relenting; “I didn’t mean to; but you drove me to it. What do you want of more money than you’ve got already?—that’s what I meant to ask. You’re a rich man now. You’ve ten times as much as you need; what do you want of more? To carry into the next world with ye? one would think so,—an old man like you!”
“Boy!” said the trembling Peternot, “you don’t know what you’re talking about!”
“Yes, I do; I’m talking just what a good many other folks talk, only not to your face. They say, ‘There’s old Squire Peternot, seventy years old, with one foot almost in the grave,—rich enough in all conscience,—don’t use even the interest on what money he has, but lays it up, lays it up,—lives meanly as the poorest farmer in town,—never gives a dollar, except when he can’t help it, and then you’d think it hurt him like pulling his teeth,—and yet there he is, trying to get Aunt Patsy’s little house and lot away from her,—making tight bargains, screwing his workmen’s wages down to the lowest notch’; that’s what I’ve heard, every word of it, and you know that every word of it is true!”
“I have my own ideas about property,” said the squire; “and no man—no prudent man—likes to squander what’s his own.”
“And so you, with all your wealth, come and grab this money, which is all I have in the world, and offer me five dollars to give it up to you! You _are_ a prudent man! I say squander!”
“I’ll give you twenty dollars of it,—and that’s liberal, I’m sure,” said Peternot, a good deal shaken by what Jack had said, but unable, from long habit, to take his hand from any worldly goods that it chanced to cover.
“Twenty dollars!” laughed Jack, with scornful defiance. “_I_ don’t make bargains on Sunday.”
This cool sarcasm caused the worthy Peternot to wince as at the taste of some bitter medicine. “I don’t bargain on the Lord’s day, neither. But I see the necessity of coming to some sort of terms with you.”
“Very well; then you just walk off and leave me and my dog to take care of this money; those are the only terms you can come to with me.”
“But what do you propose to do, if I don’t walk off?”
“Stay here,—Lion and I,—and hang on to our _treasure-trove_. Your nephew, who knows so much about law, advised me to keep possession,—to fight for it,—and I will.”
“And do you think I’m going to give up to you, you renegade?” cried the squire. He moved to lay his hand on the basket; but there was something in Lion’s growl he didn’t like. “I’ll beat that beast’s brains out, if he offers to touch me!” he exclaimed, grasping his cane menacingly.
“I advise you not to try that little thing,” said Jack. “If you should miss your stroke, where would you be the next minute?”
The squire thought of that. His tone changed slightly.
“I don’t leave this spot till I git possession of that money!”
“All right, Squire. Sit down,—you’d better. You’ll have some time to stop, I guess. Have a peach?” And the audacious little wretch took one out of his coat-pocket. “We shall need refreshments before we get through!” As Peternot indignantly declined the proffered fruit, Jack quietly broke it open, and ate, with a relish, the rich yellow pulp. The old man accepted the invitation to sit down, however, and reposed his stiff old limbs on the end of the hollow log, not clearly foreseeing how this little adventure was to end.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER IX
THE SQUIRE’S PERPLEXITY AND JACK’S STRATAGEM.
A LITTLE calm reflection opened the squire’s mind to a ray of light which would certainly have dawned upon it before, had not his wits been clouded by passion. “Boy!” he suddenly exclaimed, “I believe every dollar of that money is bogus.”
“Then what’s the use of making a row over it?” was the boy’s cool retort.
“It’s the business of a magistrate to look after counterfeiters and counterfeit money,” said Peternot. But at the same time he thought, “_He_ has satisfied himself that it _ain’t_ counterfeit; his whole conduct shows it.” And the avaricious old man still laid siege to the basket.
Half an hour passed, during which time very little was said. Jack took out his knife and began to whittle a stick; perhaps he was not unwilling to show the squire that he was armed. He also put on his coat, and then his shoes, after emptying their contents into the basket.
Peternot grew more and more impatient, as he saw the afternoon gliding away. Another half-hour, and the situation still remained unchanged. “I may set here till night,” thought he, “and all night, and all day to-morrow, fur’s I know,—but what’s the use? He’ll stick as long as I do. He’s tough; he can stand anything; ye can’t starve a canal-driver. Sakes!” he exclaimed, half aloud, suddenly putting his hand into his pocket, remembering that the key of his kitchen door was there.
On leaving home he had carefully made fast all the doors and windows of his house,—his wife and nephew having gone to meeting that afternoon; and now, should they return before he did, they would find themselves locked out!
Still the old man’s cupidity would not suffer him to raise the siege.
He was taken by a fit of coughing; and, fearing to catch cold by sitting on the damp log, he got up and walked about,—frowning and striking his cane upon the ground in huge dissatisfaction and disgust. “You’re the most obstinate, unreasonable boy I ever see!” he exclaimed angrily.
“Am I?” laughed Jack. “You haven’t begun to see how obstinate I am. Wonder what you’ll think to-morrow at this time? or the next day?” And what, he might have added, would the wife and nephew think?
“Hush!” whispered the old man. “What boys are those?”
There was a crackling of sticks in a not very distant part of the woods, occasioned by a gang of four or five boys climbing Peternot’s brush fence. Jack jumped upon the log and looked.
“It’s the Huswick tribe,” said he. “There’s Dock, there’s Hank, there’s Cub,—there they all are, going over your fence like a flock of sheep!”
“The Huswicks, Cub and Dock,—Hank with ’em!” ejaculated the squire, in great excitement. “They’re the wust set of boys in town!”
“Yes, and they’re putting straight towards your house,” observed Jack.
“They’re after my melons!” said Peternot, brandishing his cane. “The rogues! I’ll larn ’em!” With a limping stride he started in pursuit, but turned back immediately. “Promise me you’ll stay here!”
Jack couldn’t help laughing at the old man’s simplicity. “Do you think I’m such a fool as to make that promise? Or even if I should, would you trust me to keep it? Come!” cried Jack, “you must have a better opinion of me than you pretend.”
“I know you have some good traits—the rogues will destroy all my melons—if I could borrow your dog—leave your basket and go with me—we’ll settle our diffikilty when we come back,” said the agitated squire.
“I’ll take care of my basket; you can look after your melons,” retorted Jack.
“I’d as lives have a passel o’ pigs in my melon-patch!” cried Peternot, striding to and fro. “Boy! I’m sure this money is bogus!—I wish I had called to ’em ’fore they got out o’ hearin’!”
“Why didn’t ye?” asked Jack.
“That might ’a’ led ’em to come here, and we don’t want anybody by the name o’ Huswick to have a hand in this business. But my melons!—Boy, be reasonable!”
“Be reasonable yourself, Squire Peternot! You’re sure this money is bogus; then why don’t you leave it and go for your melons?”
“I _ain’t_ sure,” replied the squire. “But _you_’re sure it’s good money; I see that, and you’re no fool.”
“Thank ye, sir,” said Jack, politely. And, seeing that the old man’s cupidity made him ready to believe almost anything, he added, “Now look here! If I’ll give you what money there is in the basket, will you be satisfied?”
Peternot started. “Satisfied? Sartin—I can’t tell—explain!”
“Will you take this, and leave me what there is still in the log? That’s what I mean,” said Jack, with an air of candor.
Peternot, astonished by this strange proposition, but afraid of being cheated out of a few dollars, asked, “How much is there in the log?” at the same time stooping with difficulty and peeping into the cavity.
“That’s my risk. Come, is it a bargain?”
“I thought you didn’t make bargains on the Sabbath day!”
“Well, I don’t,” laughed Jack, “unless some good man sets me the example. I’m only a boy,—it’s easy to corrupt me.”
“Corrupt you! you sassy, profane—”
“Sabbath-breaker,” suggested Jack, as Peternot hesitated for a word bad enough. “What do you say to my offer?”
“I say, if there’s money in the log, it belongs to me, the same as this belongs to me.” And the squire, impressed by the importance of having some accurate knowledge on that point, vigorously thrust in his cane.
“Your stick can’t give ye much information,” said Jack. “You’ll have to go in yourself.”
“I’m going in myself!” exclaimed the squire, sharply. “Move out of my way here.”
Jack readily made room for him, tickled to the heart’s core at the thought of the stiff-jointed old man’s going into the log.
“Grin, will ye?” said Peternot. “I s’pose you think the minute I’m in there you’ll start to run with your basket. But you can’t run fur with that weight to carry; I shall ketch ye!”
He leaned his cane by the log, laid his hat beside it, and put his head and one arm into the cavity. Then he put in his shoulders and both arms. “I can hear ye, if ye stir to move!” he cried from the hollow depths, which muffled his voice; and in his body went, leaving only the long Peternot legs sticking out.
Jack was convulsed with laughter. But all at once the idea occurred to him that practical advantage might be taken of the squire’s ludicrous situation. Up he jumped, and seizing the largest of the sticks with which he had previously stopped the mouth of the log, began to thrust them in after the squire.
“Here! oh! oh! murder!” cried the voice, now more muffled than ever, while the old man struggled violently to get out. “Oh! oh!”
“Good by!” screamed Jack, holding him, and thrusting in more sticks. “_You_ may have what’s in the log, and _I_’ll take the basket.”
[Illustration: PETERNOT IN THE HOLLOW LOG.]
“Help! ho! I’m killed!” said the voice, growing fainter and fainter.
“And buried!” Jack yelled back, laughing with wild excitement. “But you kick well, for all that!” And in went more rubbish about the old man’s heels. “How do ye like your bargain? You’ll have plenty of time to count your dollars before I send Pipkin over to help you out.”
And, having got the old man wedged so tightly into the log that he could not even kick, Jack, inspired with extraordinary strength for the occasion, caught up his basket of coin and started to run, followed by Lion.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER X
“THE HUSWICK TRIBE.”
RUNNING quickly behind walls and fences, the Huswick boys made a rapid raid upon Peternot’s melon-patch, and left it loaded with spoils.
“Say, Dock!” said Hank (nickname for Henry), skulking behind some bushes, “le’s put for Chatford’s orchard, and scatter rines by the way, so if we’re tracked the old man’ll think ’t was the deacon’s boys hooked his melons.”
“Go ahead!” said Dock (nickname for Jehoshaphat), carrying two fine ripe melons on his left arm while he dug into one of them with a jack-knife in his right hand. “Stoop, and keep clus to the fence!”
“No danger, old man’s gone to meetin’,” said Cub, whose real name was Richard,—his odd shape (he was ludicrously short and fat) having probably suggested the nickname.
“Me an’ Cub can go without stoopin’,” giggled Hod, the youngest (christened Horace). “See Hank! he looks like a well-sweep!”
And indeed the second of the boys, who was as wonderfully tall and lank as Cub was short and thick, bore no slight resemblance to that ornament of country door-yards.
“Hanged if one o’ mine ain’t a green one!” exclaimed Tug (short for Dwight), dashing to the ground a large watermelon, the sight of which in ruins would have made old Peternot’s heart ache.
“Guess we made a clean sweep of all the ripe ones,” said Cub. “No, you don’t!” as Tug offered to relieve him of one of his three. “I never had my fill o’ melons yit, though I’ve”—cramming his mouth while he continued to talk—“been in the squire’s patch much as once afore now.”
“You never had your fill of anything, I believe, Cub!” said Hod, with his usual giggle. “Remember when we went there in the night last year?”
“Night’s no time to go for melons,” said Cub. “Ye can’t tell a ripe one ’thout cuttin’ into ’t.”
“Yes, ye can,” said Tug; “smell on ’t. That’s the best way to tell a mushmelon.”
“Cub’s terrible petic’lar about slashin’ the ol’ man’s whoppers, all to once,” said Horace.
“Of course, for if we cut a green one we sha’n’t find it ripe next time we go,” Cub explained. “Jest look! we’re makin’ a string o’ rines all the way from Peternot’s to the deacon’s orchard!”
“There now, boys,” said Hank, “throw what rines ye got down here by the brook, an’ stop eatin’ till we git to the woods.”
Their course had been westward, until they reached the orchard. They now took the line of stone-wall which divided the squire’s land from the deacon’s, and which led northward to the corner of Peternot’s wood-lot,—Hank following Dock, Cub following Hank, Tug after Cub, and Hod bringing up the rear. In this order they entered the woods, and were hastening to find a secluded spot where they could sit and enjoy their melons, when suddenly Dock stopped.
“Thought I heard somebody,” he said to Hank, coming up.
“So did I. Lay low, boys! Git behind this log!”
Down went boys and melons in a heap, each of the brothers, as he arrived, tumbling himself and his load with the rest. There they lay, only Hank’s long, crane-like neck being stretched up over the log to reconnoitre; but presently even he thought it time to duck, and threw himself flat upon the ground with the rest.
“Keep dark!” he whispered; “it’s that Jack Hazard, that lives to the deacon’s! him an’ his big dog!”
Jack indeed it was, who had been too intently occupied in fastening Peternot into the log to notice the approach of the Huswick boys. He had thought of them, to be sure, but had supposed they would return through the woods as they went.
He was now running as fast as he could with his basket of treasure, directing his course towards the orchard, but keeping a little to the right in order to reach a low length of fence, over which he intended to climb, and then betake himself to the smoother ground of the pasture. A log lay in his way. Lion, growling, drew back from it—too late. Jack, in his headlong haste, sprang upon it, and leaped down on the other side, alighting on a frightful heap of legs and heads and watermelons. He jumped on Hank, tripped against Cub, and, falling, spilt his basket of rattling coin all over Tug and Dock and Hod. Thereupon the heap rose up as one man, astonishing poor Jack much as if he had stumbled upon a band of Indians lying in ambush.
“What in thunder!—Jerushy mighty!—half-dollars!” ejaculated Cub and Dock and Tug; while Hank stretched himself up to his full height, and Hod fell vindictively upon Jack.
“Le’ me go!” screamed Jack, taking his knee out of a muskmelon, and shaking off his assailant.
“That’s my melon,” said Hod, diving at him again furiously, “an’ you’ve smashed it!”
He was butting and striking with blind rage, when Lion bounced upon him, and actually had him by the collar of his coat, dragging and shaking him with terrible growls, when Tug and Cub and Dock—one catching Hod by the heels, one Jack, and the other Lion—disentangled the combatants.
“Where j’e git all this money?” demanded Cub.
“Found it, and I’m carrying it home,” said Jack, scrambling to pick up his scattered half-dollars.
“He’s murdered somebody for it!” cried Hank, peering in the direction of the hollow log. “I heerd him! Hold on to him, boys!” and he ran to make discoveries.
“Don’t ye do that!” said Jack, as Hod rushed to help him pick up the coin. “My dog will have hold of ye again! Watch, Lion!”
“Take that out o’ yer pocket, Hod!” said Cub, seizing his youngest brother by the neck. “Melons is fair game, but now ye’re stealin’. None o’ that while I’m around!”
Hank, meanwhile, had reached the hollow log, beside which the hat and cane were; when, hearing groans from within and seeing a pair of legs sticking out, he began at once to remove the rubbish from the opening. Dock and Tug went to his assistance; and, each laying hold of a leg while Hank pulled energetically at the coat-tail, poor old Peternot, half smothered, fearfully rumpled, and frightfully cross, was hauled out by the heels horizontally.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XI
THE “COURT” AND THE “VERDICT.”
WHEN at length the squire stood upon the legs he had been drawn out by, and found himself in the presence of the Huswick boys, the recognition and pleasure were mutual.
“You scoundrels!” he began, brushing the dirt from his clothes and hair.
“What are we scoundrels fer?” said Hank, the tall one, with a comical grin on his thin, sinewy features. “Fer snakin’ ye out of the log?”
“If ye ain’t satisfied, we can pack ye in agin,” suggested Dock. But Peternot did not seem to take that view of the matter.
“How come ye in there, anyhow?” said Tug. “Was he murderin’ on ye?”
“Yes! Where is the villain? He’s got my money!” And away limped the old man in pursuit of the youthful robber and assassin.
“Them melons!” whispered Tug.
“Can’t help it now,” muttered Dock. “Hank, I wish you’d left the old fox in his hole!”
Guided by the sound of voices, and the sight of a head or two between the standing trunks, Peternot marched straight to the log behind which Jack was busy picking up his half-dollars. There were Cub and Hod watching him, while Lion watched them; there also were the stolen melons,—an interesting sight to the angry squire.
“Hullo, boys!” said Hank, leaning over the log, with one foot upon it, “where did them melons come from?”
“Do’no’,” replied Cub. “They was here when we come,—wa’n’t they, Hod?”
“Them melons come from my garden, and they come by your hands!” exclaimed Peternot. “I know it! and I’ll have ye up for trespassin’, the hull coboodle of ye!”
“Look here, squire!” said Hank, “seems to me you’re a little mite hasty. You ought to know your friends better ’n all that. Where’d you be now, if ’twa’n’t for us? In that ’ere hole. And where’ll ye be agin in less’n no time, if ye ain’t plaguy careful? In that ’ere hole!”
“He says you was murderin’ on him, Jack,” observed Tug.
“That’s a likely story!” cried the excited Jack, who by this time had got his half-dollars all back into the basket again. “Could I put him into the log? He was _in_ the log,—he was robbing _me_,—so I fastened him in and got away,—or I _should_ have got away, if I hadn’t stumbled over you fellows. Now just help me home with this money, and I’ll pay you well.”
“Help him at your peril!” said Peternot. Then, seeing the importance of securing such powerful allies, he added, “Maybe I was hasty, boys. Help me home with _my_ money, and I’ll say nothin’ about the melons.”
“That’s fair, if it’s your money,” said Hank. “Seems to be a dispute about it. Guess we’ll try the case. Come, now,—you fust, squire,—give in yer evidence whilst the court refreshes himself with a melon or two.”
So saying, Hank coolly reached over and stuck his knife into a watermelon, which he proceeded to eat, sitting on the log. “Take holt, boys,” he said, “this is lickin’ good,—wonder whose patch it come from! Yours, did ye say, squire? Guess I shall have to pay ye a visit some time. No, no, Jack! set down that basket! ye can’t leave the court with the damages ’fore the case is decided. Wal, seein’ the old man hain’t found his tongue yit, we’ll hear _your_ testimony.”
Peternot was, in fact, so choked with wrath at the sight of the five Huswick boys—for all the others had duly followed Hank’s example—sitting comfortably on the log, regaling themselves with his melons, that he could not have spoken without doing his cause great injury; and thus it happened that Jack was first heard.
[Illustration: THE “COURT” IN THE WOODS.—Page 73.]
“Now put your hand on this watermelon an’ swear’t you’ll tell the truth, the hull truth, and nothin’ but the truth,” said Hank, who had more than once seen the inside of a court-room,—perhaps unwillingly; and he handed Jack a slice of melon, which the poor fellow took with a grin and ate. “Now answer me; an’ don’t ye try to tell too much; for though they alluz make a chap swear to tell the _hull_ truth, they never let him, but shet his mouth dumb quick if he goes to let out more ’n they ask fer. Now.” (Hank took a bite of melon.) “What’s yer name?”
“Jack Hazard.”
“Ockepation?”
“I work for Mr. Chatford.”
“What did ye do ’fore that?” (Another bite.)
“I drove on the canal, for Captain Berrick.”
“How did ye happen to leave him?”
“He flung me into the canal twice in one day, which I thought was once too often, and I run away from him.”
“Poor boy?” (Hank dug into his melon again.)
“Yes; I never had anything,—I never had even a chance for myself till now.”
“Take another slice,” said Hank. “Now you’ve got a chance for yourself?”
“I thought I had; but this old man here comes down on me, and claims the money which I found in that hollow log.” And Jack, with the indulgence of the august court,—holding his second slice of melon in his hand,—poured forth his story.
“Now what have you got to say to all that?” said Hank, turning to the squire. “Have a bite? ye better,” holding out a piece of melon on the blade of his jack-knife.
Peternot declined to regale himself, and made answer: “I say what I’ve said to him,—the money (if ’t is money, though in all probability it’s bogus) was found on my premises, it has not been taken from my premises, and I forbid his takin’ it. But I’ve offered him a liberal reward for findin’ on ’t, and I offer it again.”
“Squire,” said Hank, “you’re a fair man, an’ I must say your melons are excellent. What do ye think, boys?”
Now the boys were unanimously of the opinion (with the exception of Hod) that the coin was spurious, and consequently good for nothing but to help them make their peace with Peternot. Jack saw them winking at each other, and knew their thoughts.
“You sha’n’t take it away from me!” he cried, throwing himself upon the basket. “I’ll die first! and you’ll have to kill my dog! O, I wish Mr. Chatford was here!”
“That’s the most sensible idee yit,” said Dock. “Boys, we don’t want to mix up with this business, only to see fair play. Better let the deacon settle it. He’s hum from meetin’ by this time. Go fer him, Bub; I’ll take care of your basket.”
“Will you! Won’t you let him have it? nor take it yourselves?”
“What should we take it fer? We’ve no claim on ’t, anyhow,” said Hank, who might, however, have thought and acted differently if he had believed the coin genuine. “Put, now! If I’m alive, the basket shall stay till you come back.”
“Besides, you can leave your dog,” said Cub. “He’ll watch your interest, while the squire’ll watch hisn. Be quick, for we can’t stay much longer ’n it’ll take to finish our melons.”
Notwithstanding his anxious doubts, Jack was persuaded that the best thing he could do was to run in all haste for the deacon, leaving Lion, Peternot, and the Huswick boys to watch each other and take care of the treasure in his absence.
“We’ll keep our word about the basket,” said Hank, with a droll look, as Jack disappeared over the fence; “but about the stuff that’s in ’t, this is the judgment of the court,—we allow ’t the squire’s claim is just, an’ give him the money, pervided he’ll say nothin’ ’bout the melons, but pay us a dollar apiece for helpin’ him carry it hum.”
“But we’ve engaged ’t the basket shall stay till he comes back,” Cub objected.
“An’ whatever else we do, we’re fellers that keeps our word,” added Dock, over his melon.
“Then how’s the coin to go?” demanded the exasperated squire, thinking the boys meant to dally with him until Mr. Chatford’s arrival.
“You don’ know nothin’ ’bout war,—you never see a one-hoss wagon!” said Dock, contemptuously. “Hod, off with yer breeches!”
Hod naturally objected, on strong personal grounds, to this part of the arrangement. He started to run, but Tug headed him off, and Cub seized him; when, finding that, with or without his consent, he was destined to part with the required garment for a season, the lamb of the flock yielded, and kicked off that portion of his fleece.
Cub took the trousers, and quickly turned the legs into a pair of bags by tying cords about the ankles. “Now bring on yer grist,” said he; “I’ll hold the sack open!”
“Plague on the dog!” said Tug. “He won’t le’ me tech it.”
“I can coax him. Here, poor fellow!” said Cub, patting him.
Lion did not greatly resent the patting, but the moment Cub’s hand reached for the basket, a deep growl warned him off.
“Kill the brute!” cried Peternot. “We can’t be bothered this way.”
“That’s easy enough, if you’ll pay damages,” said Dock.
“That I’ll do,—a miser’ble cur that stan’s in the way o’ my takin’ my own, on my own premises!”
“Kill him it is, then,” said Dock, looking for a club, and finding two. “Hank, you take this. Cub, you take your dirk-knife. Squire, lend Tug your cane, or use it yourself.”
“Now see here!” objected Hank. “This looks to me kind o’ mean,—half a dozen on us agin one dog! Hanged if I don’t like the looks o’ the pup, an’ I won’t have him killed.”
“What’ll ye do, then?”
“I’ll show ye.”
Lion was standing near the log, on the other side of which Hank placed himself.
“Now pretend you’re goin’ to grab the basket!”

CHAPTER XII
HOW HOD’S TROUSERS WENT TO THE SQUIRE’S HOUSE.
HANK leaned over the log,—his lank frame and astonishing length of limb favoring the execution of his stratagem,—and seized Lion by one of his hind legs while his attention was diverted by a feigned attack upon the treasure. Finding himself caught, the dog wheeled furiously; but on the instant Hank, swinging his hind-quarters upon the log, drew them between two prongs of an upright limb, forked near the trunk, where it was easy to hold him, with his head hanging.
“Now who’s got a good stout string?”
“Here’s a whiplash in Hod’s breeches pocket!”
Tug leaped the log with it, and assisted in lashing Lion’s hind legs to the limb, below the fork in which he was suspended by his thighs. The poor fellow’s struggling and yelping were of no avail: there he was, hung.
Meanwhile Cub held his pair of bags open, and the coin was emptied into them. The squire stooped with many a groan to pick up the scattered pieces that rolled on the ground. Then the well-freighted trousers were set astride Hank’s lofty neck; at which he began to prance and kick up, in playful imitation of a colt—or should we say a giraffe?—with a strange rider.
“Now ye needn’t but one of ye go with me,” said Peternot; “or at the most two.”
“Two can’t carry all that silver,” said Cub. “We must all help. And edge along towards Aunt Patsy’s wood-lot, if ye don’t want to meet Jack and the deacon. Comin’, Hod?”
“I can’t without my breeches!” replied the discontented youth.
In no very pleasant mood he saw his trousers ride off on Hank’s shoulders,—still visible above the undergrowth after the squire and the rest of his odd escort had disappeared from view. So great indeed was Hod’s chagrin at being left behind in this way, that he found it necessary at once to set himself about some sort of mischief. First he broke open the best of the remaining melons, and ate as much as he could of them. Then he gathered up all the rinds and fragments and placed them in the basket, together with bits of rotten wood, covering the whole with the frock which Jack had left spread over the coin.
“Now when he comes he’ll think his money is there, till he looks, then won’t he be mad!” With which happy thought Hod ran and hid in some bushes, where he could watch the fun.
Meanwhile Hod’s trousers, with their legs full of coin, were shifted from shoulder to shoulder of his big brothers, as the strange procession emerged from the woods and moved across Peternot’s pasture, the squire lamely bringing up the rear. Arrived at his house, he brought out a meal-sack, and the coin was emptied into it. He then took two of the half-dollars and offered them to Hank.
“What’s that fer?” said the tall youth, stooping to look at the money as if it had been some curious insect.
“I owe ye a dollar,” said Peternot.
“So ye du,” replied Hank, “but I prefer to take my pay in money as is money, if it’s the same thing to you.”
“You yourself said you believed this was bogus,” added Dock; “an’ I don’t s’pose you want to be hauled up for passin’ it.”
Peternot felt the force of the remark, and with a long face took from his pocket-book a bank-note, which he handed to Hank.
“The same to me, if you please,” said Dock. “I said a dollar _apiece_.”
The squire protested against such extortion, but finally, reminded that he had said two of the boys might come with him, he paid Dock also. Then Cub and Tug held out expectant hands; whereat he flew into a passion.
“I don’t even know ’t the coin is good; and d’ ye think I’m goin’ to submit to any such swindle? Clear out, you melon-thieves!”
“All right!” said Cub, coolly, with his hand on the meal-sack; “but if I don’t take my dollar with me, I take this right back where we found it, and give it to the boy.”
The firm position thus taken by Cub being approved by his brothers, especially by Tug, the poor old squire saw no way but to yield, and Cub and Tug were paid.
“Now a dollar for Hod,” said Hank.
“For Hod!” roared out the squire, like a man tortured beyond endurance. “Hod didn’t come!”
“But his breeches did. A dollar for his breeches,—if that will suit you any better. And quick!” said Hank, “or the coin goes into ’em agin, an’ back to the basket.”
“I hain’t got another dollar!” said Peternot, trembling with wrath and vexation.
“You’ve a V there; we can change it,” suggested Cub.
“Take it, and may the rum ye buy with it pizen ye, you pack o’ thieves and robbers!”
“That sounds well from you, that have jest robbed a poor boy of what you more ’n half believe is good money, but which we’re dumb sure is bogus, or else we never ’d have helped ye off with it. Thieves and robbers, hey? Hear him, boys!”
Hank laughed derisively, and all went off chuckling gleefully over their Sunday afternoon’s job, while the squire, entering his house, slammed and bolted the door behind them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XIII
HOW JACK RESCUED LION, BUT MISSED THE TREASURE.
THE deacon’s folks had not got home from meeting when Jack reached the house; but he saw them coming,—Mr. Chatford, Mr. and Mrs. Pipkin, and Phin, in the old one-horse wagon. He met them at the gate, and hurriedly told his story as they were driving on to the house.
“Boy, you’re crazy!” said the incredulous deacon.
“No, I ain’t! Do come quick! They won’t wait long, and then Peternot will take the money!”
“Well, well,—I suppose I’ll go,—pretty work for Sunday, I should say!”
“It was wrong,—I ought to have told you all about it before,” said Jack, “but I thought I was doing the best thing; I didn’t want anybody to know whose land I found the money on, so _he_ couldn’t claim it.”
“Hurrah! I’ll go too!” cried Phin. “You take care of the old mare, Phi!”
“If it’s the Huswick boys, I guess I better go and see fair play,” remarked Mr. Pipkin; and he followed with the deacon, while Phin ran ahead with Jack.
The two boys reached the pasture; and now Jack, outstripping his companion, darted forward to a certain low length of fence, leaped upon it, and peered with a wild and anxious gaze into the woods.
“They’re gone! they’re gone!” he shrieked despairingly; and, tumbling over the rails, he ran through the bushes to the log.
_They_ were gone indeed; but there was his basket, just where he had left it, covered with his frock. He flew to it, and stripped off the covering; and there Phin, as he came up, found him staring in utter consternation and dismay at a peck of melon rinds and rotten wood.
“Is that yer money?” said Phin. “I don’t believe there was any: you’ve been fooling us!”
Jack threw out the rubbish, with the frantic thought that the coin must still be there.
“They’ve robbed me!” he sobbed out, when the bottom of the basket was reached and showed nothing but rinds and fragments of rotten wood.
A whining sound came to his ear; and just then Phin said, “O, just look! what’s the matter with your dog?” Jack looked, and there, half hidden by the bushes, was Lion hanging by the hips from the forked limb of the log. He sprang to rescue him. The whiplash was tied in a tight knot, and out came the boy’s knife to cut it.
This part of the fun Hod Huswick, in his ambush, had not anticipated, and did not relish.
“Here! that’s my whiplash! don’t ye cut it!” he cried; and from the bushes leaped the bare legs with their flapping linen, to the no little astonishment of Phineas Chatford.
[Illustration: JACK RESCUES LION.]
“I’ll cut it, and you too!” The whiplash was severed, and Jack, knife in hand, turned upon Hod. “What have you done with my money?”
“Hain’t done nothin’ with ’t,—I hain’t teched it.”
“Who has?”
“They took it, and stole my breeches to carry it off in, ’cause they said they’d promised you not to take the basket. They stole my whiplash, too, fer to tie the dog with; I couldn’t help myself; an’ now you’ve cut it!”
“Where’ve they gone?”
“To Peternot’s; he hired ’em to help him carry the money home.”
Then Jack saw how completely he had been outwitted and betrayed. He did not rave at his ill-luck; but to Mr. Chatford, who now approached with Mr. Pipkin, he told what had happened, and in a tone of unnatural calmness appealed to him for redress. “For if you can’t do anything for me,” he said, turning his pale face and tearless eyes at the empty basket, “I shall get my pay out of the old squire some way, if I live! Tell him he’d better look out!”
“There, there!” said the deacon, soothingly. “Don’t make any foolish threats. I think it’s most unwarrantable conduct on Peternot’s part, and I’ll see him about it.”
“Go over there right now! why can’t ye?”
“My boy, remember it’s Sunday.”
“_He_ didn’t remember it was Sunday when he got my money away!” said Jack.
“Very true,” said the deacon. “But nothing will be gained by going to him now. To-morrow I’ll see about it.”
“To-morrow!” echoed Jack, with a fierce laugh.
“Burn his house down, I would!” whispered Phin, who, notwithstanding his profession of sympathy, felt, I regret to say, a secret gratification at Jack’s loss.
“Where was ’t ye found the money, Jack?” Mr. Pipkin inquired.
Jack led the way, and all went to look at the hollow log. While they were standing about it Hod’s brothers returned. Hod ran for his trousers, but Cub, who was about to fling them at him, changed his mind and tossed them into a tree, where they lodged.
“That’s for spilin’ the melons,” said he, regarding the heap on the ground.
Hod caught up a club to throw at his amiable brother, but wisely changed his mind, and sent the missile up into the tree, in the hope of bringing down his breeches. As they did not come at the first fire, he sent club after club up after them, sputtering all the while with indignation; while his brothers walked loungingly on to the hollow log.
Jack glared at them with deep and sullen hate, without deigning to speak; but the good deacon said, “Seems to me, fellows, you’ve played off a despicable trick on this poor boy here! You ought to have protected him in his rights; but instead of that you’ve helped rob him.”
“Not much of a robbery, I guess, deacon,” replied Dock, good-naturedly. “’Twas nothin’ but a lot o’ bogus coin, no use to him nor to anybody.”
“You’re mistaken,” replied the ingenuous Chatford, letting out a secret which Jack had thought it wise to keep. “The coin was genuine; at least I’ve good reason to think so.” And he told why.
The Huswick boys looked at each other. “If that’s the case, we didn’t git so much the start of the squire as we thought we did!” muttered Dock. “On the contrary, he’s got the start of us! What do ye say, Hank?”
“It’s too late now to say anything about it; but hanged if I wouldn’t ’a’ swore the silver was no silver! I thought ’twas nothin’ but the old man’s avariciousness made him think it might be good. We let him off too easy!” And Hank appeared more than half minded to go back and make better terms with the squire.
“They hung Lion up by the heels!” said Phin, getting behind his father, for he had a chronic dread of the Huswick tribe.
“I’d tie you up by the heels too,” said Cub, with a peculiar smile, “if ’t wa’n’t Sunday!”
Whereupon Mr. Pipkin, who had been on the point of expressing an opinion, concluded to remain silent; the ruffians _might_ forget what day it was!
“Well, come, boys; I don’t see that we can do anything,” said the deacon. “We may as well go home.”
They walked back past the tree which Hod, in his imperfect attire, was still clubbing for the obstinate trousers, getting mad at them finally, and pelting them as if they were to blame for sitting there so quietly on the limb, in spite of him. Mr. Pipkin, out of respect to Jack’s grief, took up the basket and frock and carried them; while Jack lingered behind with Lion, pondering dark thoughts.
“Come, boy! you’d better go home,” said Mr. Chatford, coaxingly. “Don’t be down-hearted. It’ll turn out right or be made up to you somehow, if you meet it in the right spirit, I’m confident.”
“I’ll be there pretty soon,—I can’t go just yet,” replied Jack, dissatisfied with everybody and everything; and he wandered off by himself in the woods, brooding upon his wrongs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XIV
SQUIRE PETERNOT AT HOME.
AFTER dismissing the Huswick boys, Squire Peternot carried his bag of coin into the room which served him as an office, where he had scarcely time to place it in a corner beside a bureau, when there came a dull thump at the kitchen door. He knew Mrs. Peternot’s signal, knocking with the soft under-part of her feeble fist, and went to let her in.
She was a thin, wrinkled woman, dressed in black, with an expression of countenance almost as stern and sour as that of the grim old squire himself.
“Huh!” said she, scowling as she entered, “how happens it ye hain’t got the fire agoin’ an’ the taters bilin’?”
“I’ve had somethin’ else to think on. Where’s Byron?” replied her husband, shortly.
“Gone to the barn with the hoss, I s’pose. But he won’t unharness,—ketch him!”
“I didn’t expect he would, with his Sunday clo’es on.”
“Sunday clo’es or any clo’es on, he don’t tech his fingers to anything that’ll sile ’em, or that looks like work, if he can help it,” muttered good Mrs. Peternot, laying off her black bonnet. “You never would allow sich laziness in your own son, an’ why ye should in a nephew any more, I can’t consait.”
“Byron is a sort of visitor,” said the squire. “And if I choose to favor him,—now that we’ve nobody else to show favors to,—why shouldn’t I?”
“If you’d felt so indulgent towards _him_ when _he_ was alive, he might be with us now,” replied the discontented wife, carefully doing up her shawl before putting it away in its appropriate drawer.
By _him_ she meant their only son, whose bad habits had received so little encouragement beneath the parental roof, that he had taken them abroad with him and become their victim.
“Why must ye forever be gallin’ me with that subject?” said Peternot, with a look of anguish. “You know I did what I thought was for the best. Come, I’ll start the fire for ye, and put the pot on, if that’ll make ye any better-natered.”
“I’m good-natered enough, but I should think somethin’ had riled you up,” returned the lady. “What is it?”
“Boys have been in the melon-patch, for one thing.”
“Been in the melon-patch! when ye stayed to hum a’most a puppus to keep watch on ’t!” And the good woman, having removed her Sunday cap, false hair and all, turned her thin face and scowling brows, crowned by a few thin gray locks, in amazement on her husband. “That’s a likely story! was ye asleep, I wonder?”
Peternot made no reply, but went on kindling the fire in the open fireplace, until his nephew came in.
“I took the horse to the barn; did you want the harness off?” said that young gentleman, standing with his gloves and hat on, watching his uncle.
There was a slight affectation of foppery about Byron,—something which the plain people of the neighborhood called “soft”; and as Peternot, on his rheumatic knees before the fire, looked up through the smoke and ashes he was blowing into his face, and saw his dainty nephew stand there gloved and grinning, something of his wife’s feeling towards that nice young man came over him,—or was it only his impatience at the smoke and ashes?
“Nat’rally, I want the harness off, arter the hoss has been standin’ in ’t a good part o’ the day!” he answered, crossly.
“Oh!” said Byron; “I rather thought so, but I didn’t know.”
“I should think any fool would know that!”
“Very likely a fool would, but I didn’t happen to.” And, with the grin still on his features, the youth looked at the kneeling old man, very much as if he would have liked to give him a vigorous kick with his polished boot.
“No matter! I’ll ’tend to it,” said the squire, and went on with his blowing.
Byron smilingly withdrew.
“You never would have stood sich impudence from _him_,” said Mrs. Peternot, through the open door of a bedroom into which she had retired; “an’ why should ye from a nephew?”
The squire made no reply to this reasonable question, but, having kindled a fire and put on the pot, went out to take care of the horse. Byron meanwhile walked about the place with his fine clothes on, until supper was ready.
“Come, Byron,” then said the squire; and both went in and took seats at the little oilcloth-covered table. The supper consisted of boiled potatoes served with their skins on, thin slices of fried pork swimming in their own melted fat, and a heavy and sour kind of bread, which, by its quality and complexion, always reminded Byron of his Aunt Peternot, who seemed to have mixed up something of herself in the dough. He was blessed with a good appetite, however, and he ate heartily, notwithstanding his unpleasant consciousness of the fact—or was it only his imagination?—that the good woman watched with a begrudging scowl every morsel that went to his plate; seeming to say, “What! another tater! More bread! A second cup of tea, and sich big cups too! Seems to me I wouldn’t make a hog of myself, if I _was_ visitin’ my uncle!”
It was never a cheerful household; on Sundays it was even less sociable than on other days, and on this particular Sunday afternoon, Byron thought the cloud which hung over it unusually heavy. Something seemed to trouble his uncle, who sat grim and silent, sipping his tea scalding hot, and working his massy jaws as if the pork and potatoes had done him an injury, and he was wreaking a gloomy vengeance upon them.
“Where are you going, Byron?” the squire asked, as his nephew was about leaving the house after supper.
“Thought I’d walk out,—didn’t know but I might call at Deacon Chatford’s by and by,—I hear they have a little singing there, Sunday evenings.”
Mrs. Peternot scowled at the young gentleman, then turned and scowled at her husband, and said in an undertone: “It’s that ’ere Annie Felton, the schoolmarm! He’s arter her,—jest like all the rest on ’em!”
“Byron,” said the squire, solemnly, “I’d like to speak with you before you go out.” And he led the way to his office-room.
“Now what?” thought Byron, anxiously. “Is he going to tell me I’ve been here about long enough, and had better pack up my trunk and clear?”
“Byron,” said the squire, closing the door behind them, “it’s a subject I ought not to bring up on the Sabbath day, but it weighs upon my mind, and I’ve concluded I’d better speak to you about it. See what you think of this.” And he took from the corner behind the bureau the meal-bag with its compact but weighty contents, which he set down with a heavy chink before his nephew.
Byron, feeling greatly relieved, peeped curiously into the sack as Peternot opened it. “By mighty!” said he, surprised at what he saw, and thrusting in his hand. “Where did ye get this?”
In a few words the squire told the story. Byron in the mean time carefully tested one of the coins, cutting it with his knife and ringing it on the hearth.
“All right,” said he; “you’ve got possession. But what’s the use? ’Tain’t good for anything.”
“You think so?”
“I’m sure of it. Very well done, for counterfeiting,—but, of course!” And Byron tossed the piece back into the bag with a smile of contempt.
“Wal, that’s jest the conclusion I’ve come to,” said the squire. “I thought all along it might be bogus; and as soon as I got it fairly into my hands, I was sartin on ’t. What provokes me is the trouble it cost,—and more ’n all, the money them pesky Huswick boys gouged out of me!” And the old man groaned.
By this time Mrs. Peternot, her curiosity excited regarding the conference of uncle and nephew, came into the room, for an excuse exclaiming, “Why, squire! what have you got the house shet up so tight for?” and proceeded to open the window. “Massy on us! what ye got in the bag?”
“I told ye I had somethin’ to think on, this arternoon,” said Peternot; “and this is it.”
“It has cost him five dollars,” remarked Byron, pleasantly, “and it’s worth, as old metal, about fifty cents!”
“Wal, you have been fooled, complete!” exclaimed the old lady. “I don’t wonder ye kep’ it to yerself! Five dollars! have ye lost yer wits?”
“Come, come! I’m feelin’ uncomf’table enough about it, a’ready!” said the squire. “But there’s a possibility, yet, that it may be good money. Can’t tell. I should do jest so agin, under the sarcumstances, most likely. Any way it’s better to have it in my possession, than to leave bad boys to carry it off and pass it, as they undoubtedly would. I don’t want it to make trouble ’twixt me and my neighbors, though; and, Byron, if you are going over to the deacon’s, you might see what he has to say about it; tell him it’s counterfeit, and that I thought so—kind o’ thought so—all along, but considered it my duty—you understand?”
Byron understood, and smilingly replied that he would “make it all right” for his uncle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XV
JACK AND THE HUSWICK BOYS.
JACK—no longer the bright and cheerful lad whom we so lately saw picking up stones in the hilly pasture—went home, brooding darkly over his wrongs, and refused to be comforted by anything the good deacon and his wife could say to him.
“He robbed me, and hung up my dog by the heels,—got the Huswick tribe to help him; and here I am, alone against all of ’em, and nobody lifts a hand or says a word to help _me_!” was his bitter complaint, as he took the milk-pails after supper, and went out of the kitchen, shutting the door after him (I am sorry to say) with something like a bang.
“I’m a little disappointed in Jack,” observed the deacon, sadly.
“O, well, I don’t know,” replied his wife,—“you needn’t be; almost any boy of as much will and spirit as he has would feel so. He has been shamefully wronged,—you’ll allow that.”
“But he blames me!” said the deacon.
“Blames everybody!” struck in Mr. Pipkin, on the point of going out, but standing and holding the door open. “I don’t s’pose anything under heavens would satisfy him, Mis’ Chatford, but for me and the deacon to march over to Peternot’s, give the old reprobate a good cudgellin’, which I don’t deny but what he desarves fast enough, and lug hum the money.”
“I wish the money had been at the bottom of the sea before ever Jack stumbled upon it!” said Mr. Chatford. “I shall certainly go over and see the squire in the morning, and be plain with him,—for I do think he has acted a most dishonorable part in the matter.”
“I back ye up on that,” said Mr. Pipkin.
“A sight of good your backing up will do!” remarked Mrs. Pipkin, sarcastically. “It won’t restore Jack’s money. I don’t wonder he’s sulky,—we all set down, so quiet, talking over his loss, instead of walking straight over to the squire’s, and doing something, as I believe I should if I was a man.”
“Wish ye was one, for a little spell,” said Mr. Pipkin, showing all his front teeth. “Guess you’d make old Peternot’s fur fly! Guess he’d wish—”
“Mr. Pipkin!” interrupted Mrs. Pipkin, in a warning voice, “you’ll oblige me very much by shutting that door, with yourself on the outside!”
Mr. Pipkin still showed a considerable amount of ivory, as he turned, and said aside to the deacon, with a wink: “These ’ere women!—have to indulge ’em. No use of answerin’ back, as old Dr. Larkin, minister o’ the gospil,—six foot high, eighty year old, wore a wig, best man in the world,—said once, as he was goin’ into a house where there was a parrot, and the parrot sung out, ‘That’s an old fool!’—‘No use of answerin’ back!’ says the good old doctor,—‘hi, hi!—I often think on ’t.’”
“Mr. Pipkin,” said Mrs. Pipkin, with biting severity, pointing at the door, “will you oblige me?”
And Mr. Pipkin obliged her, chuckling as he went.
Jack sat milking a cow, with his head pressed against her flank, looking down into the pail, in which the bright streams were dancing, when Phin came into the yard.
“Say, Jack!” cried that perfidious youngster, “wasn’t it too bad, though, for you to be robbed of all that money?” although Phin’s private sentiment was that it was a capital joke. “And what do you think I overheard just now? Mrs. Pip said if she was you she would get hold of it again somehow; and father said you would have a right to take it anywhere, if you could lay hands on it; he didn’t know but ’t would be _justifiable_,—that was his word.”
“That’s all the good words do; for how can I get it?” said Jack, who, having, in his imagination, again and again, by some desperate act, overthrown his enemy and regained his lost treasure, would have been glad enough to know how his wild thoughts could be successfully reduced to practice.
He was still nourishing in his excited mind these fiery fancies, when, the milking over, he went to walk in the orchard; having all sorts of fearful adventures with the gaunt old Peternot, and always coming off triumphant with his treasure. Now he hurled him down his own cellar-way, and buttoned the door. Now he caught him, and, single-handed, tied him with a clothes-line, drawing it dreadfully tight, in the hardest kind of hard knots, and left him bound to a bed-post. Then the squire fell dead in a fit,—a judgment upon him for his wickedness,—just as he was lifting the money into his wagon in order to carry it away and sell it. Or Lion took the old man down and held him while his young master bore off the coin. Jack got the treasure in every instance,—only to wake up at last, and find that all his dreams of what he might do left him still hopelessly wronged and baffled.
He passed on through the orchard, and unconsciously drew near the scene of the afternoon’s conflict. That had still a strange attraction for him; he must once more view the spot where his hopes of fortune had been raised so high, to be followed so soon by impotent rage and despair.
As he advanced through the darkening woods,—for it was now dusk,—he heard noises in the direction of the hollow log, and thought, with a sudden wild leap of the heart, that one of his dreams of vengeance might be coming true. “It’s old Peternot! he has come back to get the rest of the money in the log! Here! keep behind me, Lion!”
Then he heard voices, and, gliding near, among the shadowy trees, perceived that it was not the squire, but some of the “Huswick tribe,” whom the hope of finding more coin had brought again to the hollow log. There were Cub and Tug and Hank; they had broken the rotten shell to pieces, laying the cavity completely open; and they now stood around it, poking in the rubbish with sticks or fingers or feet, hunting—in vain it seemed—for stray half-dollars.
“Hullo, Bub!” said Hank, “ye made a perty clean sweep on ’t, didn’t ye! Here’s the old box, but not a dollar to pay us for our trouble! That seems kind o’ mean.”
Jack did not answer, but, keeping Lion at his side, walked slowly past the group, glaring sullenly at them from under his angry brows.
“He’s afraid to speak,” said Cub.
“Afraid?” said Jack, turning and facing him. “I despise you too much to speak to you! Great lubberly fellows like you, to take the part of an old miser against one boy,—I look upon you as cowards and thieves!”
“Remember how we served your dog!” said Cub, with a malignant grin.
“Yes, I do remember it! You had to wait till I was gone before you had the courage to do even that! If you hadn’t lied to me, and got me out of the way first, you never would have taken that money,—somebody would have been hurt first!”
“Look out!” said Cub, seizing a broken branch, and advancing towards the audacious youngster.
“Come on!” cried Jack, jeeringly. “You’re big enough to cut up into six decent fellows,—if anything decent could be made out of such rubbish, but—you’d better bring fifteen or twenty of your big brothers to help you! See here!” said Jack, as the broken branch came whizzing past his head, “two can play at that game!” And he sent back a club with so sure an aim that it took the burly Cub full in the stomach. “No credit to me!” yelled Jack, alert on his legs. “Couldn’t help hitting such a big mark!”
“O, git out, Cub!” Hank called after his brother; “what’s the use? I don’t blame the boy. We’ve been hard enough on him, and now I’m goin’ to take his part. Come back here, Bub! I want to talk. You sha’n’t be hurt.”
“Hurt? as if I was afraid of him! It’s all I can do to keep my dog from his throat,—he has a grudge to wipe out! Here, Lion! Put the souls of the whole tribe of you in a balance, and my dog’s would out-weigh ’em! You could shake ’em all in a pepperbox, and not hear ’em rattle; they would have as much room in a teapot as so many crabs in Lake Erie!”
“I like your spunk, Bub!” said Hank, laughing. “And, see here! we never would have gi’n the old man the money, if we’d thought ’twas good for shucks. You know that.”
“No, I don’t know it! I believe you’re mean enough for anything.”
“That’s the talk! You’ve a right to think so. But what if we should help you now to git the money back?”
“You can’t!” exclaimed Jack.
“Can’t! you don’t know what we can do!”
“Then why don’t you go and git it?”
“’Cause we’ve no right to,—’tain’t ourn,—’t would be stealin’. But you’ve the fust claim on ’t,—_you_ could take it, and we could help ye, and then Peternot might git it back if he could.”
“I guess nobody’d get it again, if it was once in your hands!”
“There ye do us wrong,” said Tug. “We ain’t over-pe’tic’lar ’bout helpin’ ourselves to melons and sich trash where we can find it, but money is another thing.”
“And didn’t I make Hod throw down a handful of the half-dollars he was pickin’ up for ye?” added Cub.
“Which you thought was bogus,” retorted Jack,—who was, however, beginning to be impressed by these friendly suggestions.
“Of course, we should expect a little suthin for our trouble,” said Hank; “but that can all be agreed on aforehand. If you can git back the money, you won’t mind payin’ us—say—here’s me an’ Tug an’ Cub—ten dollars apiece,—that’s thirty dollars, for the resk we run?”
“But we can’t get it!”
“Mebby not, but we can try. No harm in that. It’s gittin’ dark now,—we can edge along towards the squire’s, and see what we can do. Send your dog hum; he’ll only be in the way.”
Jack was far from putting implicit trust in the honor of a Huswick, even where the serious subject of money was involved; but was not this his only chance—though a slender one—of getting back any portion of his treasure? And would he not prefer sharing it with these scamps, to leaving it peaceably in the possession of his enemy, the squire?
“If we can only find out where it is,” said Hank, “then we can be arguin’ with the old man,—for I guess he’ll let us into the house, one at a time,—an’ finally carry it off ’fore his face an’ eyes, without we can hit on some luckier way.”
Jack remembered Mr. Chatford’s word, reported to him by Phin,—that such an act on his part would be _justifiable_,—and so, regardless of the whisperings of conscience and of prudence, which nevertheless he could not quite reconcile to the course he was about to take, yielded to temptation, sent Lion home, and entered into an agreement with the Huswick boys.

CHAPTER XVI
HOW JACK CALLED AT THE SQUIRE’S.
ABOUT an hour later several dark figures might have been seen creeping stealthily along, behind Squire Peternot’s garden wall, in the direction of the house. A dim light shone at a window, and towards this they cautiously advanced. Jack remembered how, on a former occasion, he had gone with two of these same companions,—Cub and Tug, though he did not know them then,—in a mob that was to have attacked Aunt Patsy’s house, how they had approached _her_ window, and how he had abhorred their base designs; and he could not help wondering a little at the strange chance which now made him the accomplice of such wrong-doers. He seemed to himself in the mean time much more the reckless little canal-driver of old times, than the better self which had been developed under the wholesome influences of his new home and friends.
“Now keep dark, boys,” said Hank, stopping behind some quince-bushes, “till I see how the land lays.” He stole round the edge of the bushes, to a spot that commanded a good view of the window, not more than two rods off. Being tall, he could look into it and see by the light of a dim tallow candle what was going on in the Peternot sitting-room.
“All right. Only the old man and woman. She’s jest goin’ into t’ other room,—to bed, I guess. He sets by the table, chin in his hands; book open beside him,—Bible, looks like,—but he ain’t readin’. No, she ain’t goin’ to bed,—there she comes back agin.”
“Keep still!” whispered Jack. “There’s somebody!”
Somebody approaching from the street, entering the yard, walking straight towards the house, and passing out of sight by the front corner.
“Old man’s nephew! the Dinks feller!” whispered Hank. “Comes in at the door,—says something,—old man looks up,—lights another candle; they are going to another room.”
A light now appeared at another window, which Jack, greatly excited, discovered to be partly open. Close by it grew a lilac-bush, under cover of which he drew near, and peeped. He saw the tall form of Peternot cross the room, and then heard a clatter of chairs. Growing bolder, he advanced his head still farther, and saw uncle and nephew seated between a bureau in one corner, and a table on which the light was, at one side of the room.
“Did ye see ’em? have a talk with ’em?” Peternot was saying.
“Yes,” replied Byron Dinks; “they didn’t have much of a sing,—schoolma’am wasn’t there,—not much company; but, having an eye to the winter school, thought I’d stay and make myself agreeable.”
“That’s right, that’s right, nephew. And did ye make it all smooth with Mr. Chatford?”
“I guess so; said you thought only of doing your duty in the matter; you didn’t want the money, but, knowing it was counterfeit—”
“There you went a little too fur, nephew; I didn’t _know_; but go on.”
“It was well I made the statement, however, for that brought out a surprising fact. You’ll be astonished, uncle!”
“Hey? what is it?”
“The deacon said he was gratified to know you had acted on the supposition that the coin was spurious; and he felt sure that you would be ready to do the boy justice when you found out your mistake.”
“Mistake? What mistake?”
“Coin is genuine!”
“No!”
“He says so; says he took half a dollar of it to the goldsmith, over at the Basin, and he pronounced it good; at any rate, he gave a good piece for it.”
“Nephew, you amaze me!—I—this is news—news indeed!”
The squire got up, and, turning to the corner of the room, drew forth from behind the bureau an object, the sight of which made Jack’s heart beat wildly.
“That’s it!” whispered Hank in his ear, leaning forwards, behind a branch of the lilac-bush.
Peternot opened the loosely tied sack, and uncle and nephew eagerly examined its contents.
[Illustration: JACK AT THE WINDOW.]
“It’s the tarnish that makes the silver look so bad,” said the squire. “That deceived both on us. I had all the while a strange feelin’ that the coin was good, though my reason said the contrary. It was only arter I’d got it, and had paid the Huswicks, that my reason got the upper hand, and I felt so sure ’twas bogus. I’m glad you talked with the deacon. It’s astonishing! I didn’t make so bad a bargain with the rogues, arter all! I guess we’d better keep it all together,” added the squire, as Byron seemed inclined to retain the specimens he had been handling.
“Be ye comin’, any time to-night?” called the voice of Mrs. Peternot from the adjoining room.
“She’s waitin’,” said the squire. “We was just goin’ to ’tend prayers, when you come in,—had been delayin’ a little on your account. I’ll put it back here for the present; then, arter prayers, I’ll see what had better be done with ’t for the night.”
Peternot, having returned the bag to its niche, sent his nephew out of the room before him, and followed, bearing the candle, which he blew out, to save it, as he crossed the threshold. The door was left open, however, and a dim light stole into the room from the kitchen beyond.
“Now’s your time!” whispered Hank. “I’ll put ye in there! Pass out the bag,—be still about it,—it’s all right.”
“I can’t, without making a noise!” replied Jack, trembling with excitement. “They’ll hear.”
“No, they won’t! Don’t hurry. I’ll help you. Take off your shoes.”
Jack took off his shoes and hat, giving them to Tug to hold. Still he hesitated.
“I wish they had shut the door! Wait a minute! Hark!”
“The old man is readin’ the Scriptur’s!” said Hank. “Then he’ll pray. It couldn’t have happened better. Ye could grind a scythe, when he’s prayin’, an’ he wouldn’t hear.”
Jack listened a moment, and heard the squire read in a loud, nasal tone:—
“_But know this, that if the good man of the house had known in what hour the thief would come he would have watched._”
“I _can’t_ go!” Jack whispered, turning away.
“You can!” Hank insisted. “Now or never! Your only chance. I’ll lift you up.”
“Well! lift! careful!”
Hank lifted him, and Jack went in at the window feet foremost. In a moment he found himself standing on the floor,—frightened, but alert and resolute. He did not think he had made much noise.
The squire continued reading:—
“_The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites._”
A thrill of terror crept over poor Jack, who could not help thinking that all this applied, somehow, particularly to himself. But it was too late now to draw back, he thought.
He glided across the carpetless floor, making scarcely any noise with his bare feet, except that his ankle-bones cracked alarmingly. He did not stop until he reached the corner by the bureau; when he perceived, by the changed tones of voice, that Peternot was no longer reading, but talking,—making a few solemn comments on “the words,” as he phrased it, which they were “called to consider.” It was well for Jack that he had seen good Mr. and Mrs. Chatford at their devotions, and also known them in their daily lives, for otherwise I know not what contemptuous ideas of religion he might have received, from witnessing the family worship of the hard-hearted and worldly-minded squire.
As Peternot’s discourse was broken by intervals of silence, Jack thought, “I’ll wait till he begins to pray.” Then came a clatter of chairs: “They’re going to kneel down!” thought he, and grasped tightly the loose top of the bag. But just then, to his consternation, he heard heavy footsteps approaching; somebody was entering the room!
It was Peternot, who, feeling now a more anxious care for the coin than when he believed it to be spurious, had remembered, during his devotions (his heart being where his treasure was), that the window of the room was open, and who deemed it prudent to step in and shut it before he began his prayer.
The terrified Jack crowded himself into the corner by the bureau, and waited, breathless with apprehension, while Peternot closed the window, and turned to go out. The old man took two or three steps towards the bureau, and gave a glance in the direction of the bag; but having no light, he did not see the youthful house-breaker stuck up there in the dark niche, like a shivering ghost.
Then he went back into the kitchen, leaving the door wide open, the window closed and fastened, and Jack shut in.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XVII
HOW JACK TOOK TO HIS HEELS.
IN a moment all was still in the kitchen; then, after a brief silence, Peternot began to pray, in a low, solemn tone of voice. Jack, waiting and listening in his corner, was dismayed at this, remembering what Hank had just said of the old man’s prayers.
“That’s no praying!” thought he. “I shall never dare stir, unless he puts in, and makes more noise. Is that the best he can do, I wonder?”
Peternot soon showed that he could do better, his voice rising as he proceeded in a manner that greatly encouraged Jack, who now slipped from his corner, in order to make an observation.
Venturing to peep in at the open door, he saw the squire and his wife and nephew all kneeling before their chairs in the kitchen, with their backs toward him. That he considered a fortunate circumstance: they would not see him if he closed the door.
“But if I shut it,” he reflected, “I shall be in the dark, and I may stumble over a chair! I’ll take the money to the window, and get everything ready first,—see just what I must do, and how to do it; then I’ll shut it.”
He drew the bag from the corner, lifted it by its long, loose end, and carried it across the room, casting one more glance at the kneeling group as he passed the door. Then, having set the bag down under the window, he carefully felt for the fastenings, and found the usual spring in one side of the sash. This he pressed with his thumb, and ascertained that the window would easily come open. All being ready, he stepped back, closed the door softly, without daring to latch it, however, and returned to put his plan into execution.
Pressing the window-spring, he raised the sash, and found himself at once in communication with Hank and Cub on the outside.
“Now, hand it out!” said Hank.
“Wait! a little higher,” replied Jack, still pushing up the sash. Unfortunately, it stuck in the frame, and as he still kept his thumb on the spring to prevent its snapping with a noise when it reached a notch, he could not tell when it was fast. “Now, hold it,” he said, and stooped to take up the bag.
Both Cub and Hank had hold of the sash; but as it appeared to be firm in its place, both let go of it in order to seize the treasure; and so it chanced that, between them and Jack, down came the window with a loud clatter and a rattling of glass, broken by Cub’s unlucky fingers in a fruitless attempt to prevent the accident.
Frightened by the noise, which he knew would alarm the household, Jack instantly threw up the sash again, tumbled out the bag, and was tumbling himself out, when the squire rushed into the room. The fugitive scrambled head foremost through the narrow opening, and had nearly escaped, when Peternot with a firm grip seized him by the legs.
“Byron! Wife!” roared the squire within the room. “Light!”
“Boys! help!” screamed Jack, hanging head downwards on the outside, and kicking violently with the captured members.
[Illustration: AN ABRUPT LEAVE-TAKING.]
With one hand he laid hold of the lilac-bush. Hank, returning to his assistance, caught him by the shoulder; while at the same time Byron Dinks relieved his uncle by grasping one of the unlucky legs. Hank pulled on the outside; uncle and nephew pulled on the inside; and for a moment it seemed to Jack that he must certainly break in two, if the struggle continued. It lasted but three or four seconds, and was over by the time Mrs. Peternot came with the candle. Jack succeeded first in freeing the foot held by the nephew, and then made such vigorous use of it that he quickly brought off the other. He fell to the ground, and scrambled away behind the bushes; while Peternot, shouting, “Thieves! robbers!” turned to the door, and rushed out of the house in pursuit.
Jack heard the shout, and the opening of the door, and presently the ominous sound of heavy feet coming after him! He had lost sight of Hank when he fell; and now he had not the faintest idea which way his companions had fled. Had he paused to observe and listen, he might perhaps have heard their retreating footsteps, or caught sight of their gliding forms in the darkness; but the tall form treading close at his heels left him no time for consideration. He went plunging blindly over the wall, and heard the stones rattle again as his pursuer came plunging after him.
The moon had not yet risen, and objects below the horizon were scarcely visible,—an unfortunate circumstance for Jack, whose bare feet suffered in this mad race over the rough ground. Heedless of his hurts, however, he sped on, not in the direction of his own home, but of Aunt Patsy’s house; while _thud_, _thud!_ came the footsteps behind him, nearer and nearer, he fancied. Two or three times he turned his head, and there was the dim shape striding upon his heels, with a hand outstretched to grasp him, he more than once imagined. Never before would he have believed that the old man could run so!
This strange race was brought to a ludicrous close by a rock which lay in Jack’s way, as he was making for Aunt Patsy’s woods. He tripped over it, and fell headlong; and over him fell his pursuer,—a sprawling heap.
“Hang it!” said the latter, “you come pooty nigh breakin’ my neck!” And he lay on the ground laughing, while Jack sprang to his feet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER XVIII
HOW THE HEELS WENT HOME WITHOUT SHOES AND STOCKINGS.
“THAT you, Hank?”
“Yes! Didn’t you know me? What in time made you leg it so? I couldn’t hardly keep up with you!”
“I took you for old Peternot!” said the excited Jack. “I thought you got off ahead of me.”
Upon that Hank laughed again. “I knew the squire would come out; I hid by the quince-bushes till he showed himself, and then rushed out before him.”
“What was that for?”
“To lead him a wild-goose chase, while Cub and Tug got away with the money.”
“Where are they?” demanded the anxious Jack.
“Out of his reach,—that’s all I know. He didn’t foller us but a few rods; the old chap’s so lame he can’t run wuth a cent. The idee of your takin’ me for him!”
“Which way did they go? You know!” exclaimed Jack, who was in no mood for laughing at this odd mistake.
“Mebby we shall fall in with ’em, crossin’ the pastur’,” said Hank. “Ye needn’t be alarmed about your money, if we don’t. That’ll be safe. Better keep that hid somewheres, till you’re ready to dispose on ’t; for there’s no knowin’ what the old man may do. Leave that to me an’ Cub; I’ll look out for your interest.”
“Tug has got my hat and shoes!” said Jack, in sore perplexity.
“He’ll keep ’em safe,” replied Hank. “Needn’t worry.”
“My stockings!” exclaimed Jack.
“Has he got them too?”
“No; I wish he had!” For now it occurred to him that the stockings, which he certainly had on his feet before he jumped from the window, must have come off in his captors’ hands when he escaped!
“No matter; money is all right; we can afford to lose a pair of stockin’s or two,” was Hank’s consolatory remark.
He failed, however, to impress this cheerful view of the matter upon Jack, who, bareheaded, barefoot, uncertain that he should ever see his money again, felt anything but happy over the success of his rash attempt.
Hearing a low whistle not far off, Hank said, “That’s them!” and whistled in response. “One on ’em, anyhow,” as a single figure was seen approaching. “Tug?”
“Hullo!” said Tug. “Where’s Cub?”
“Ain’t he with you?” said Hank. “I told ye to keep together!”
“I thought we’d better scatter, when the old man and the Dinks feller come after us; one on ’em—I don’t know which ’twas—chased me ’bout a quarter of a mile.”
“Where are my shoes?” said Jack.
“Your shoes?” echoed Tug.
“Yes! and my hat?”
“Your hat?”
“Yes! what have you done with ’em?” cried Jack, choking with impatience and anger.
“O, to be sure! I believe I put ’em on the ground under the lilac-bush; you was so long in the room, I got tired of holdin’ on ’em; and darned if I didn’t forgit all about ’em!”
Jack was incensed at this negligence. “That’s the way you help a fellow, is it?”
“Didn’t we help you?” said Hank. “You wouldn’t have got away at all if it hadn’t been for me.”
She is mine anyway.
You're afraid of me? 
of a boy?
Ttied me to a tree.
I am alone and you've got so many men. 
Are you a man after that?
Let's go to the river and fight there.
Hear me? 
Or is it so that the highland customs mean nothing to you?
I'll kill you!
Hey, you!
Untie the boy!
Strange..
I'm left completely alone.
What do I do?
Where do I go?
Follow the birds, son.
It's all easier for the birds.
They're in the sky.
And I am on the ground.
How do I live?
How do live here, where everyone hates, robs and kills each other?
Why are they so cruel?
Teach me how to live with these people.
The almond has blossomed again in the mountains.
Man must be strong, brave, clever and decisive.
Be careful, jackals and wolfs come out in the mountains at night.
Defend yourself.
Once again.
Good boy.

- Nikolai Nikolayevich is sleeping?
- He's not at home.
He and Sophia Alexeyevna are vacationing at Belaya Tserkov.
You can go!
Marie!
Sorry for not having come sooner.
It was beyond my powers.
Here, the letters from Pushkin.
Believe me, Marie, I missed you very much.
Pestel has been arrested!
Pavel Ivanovich?
What for?
The regiment under my command will have to place under arrest the commander-in-chief and the head of the staff.
The Northern Society is for the preservation of the monarchy.
The Southern Society intends to abolish it.
To abolish the monarchy overnight is impossible, especially here, in Russia.
It can only be restricted by the law, like in Britain.
But that will be a republic, Prince.
Your arguments are useless.
We detest the ignominy of serfdom.
Pestel is not married.
Not married... 
Pestel...
Neither is Kakhovsky.
Nor Muraviev-Apostol.
But Ryleyev...
His wife... and daughter...
I'll give orders to serve dinner.
The czar will certainly come to review the troops.
His death will be a signal to action.
We in the South want to know if the Northerners agree to regicide.
I'm pleased with your brigade, Prince.
I only regret that you haven't got rid of that spirit of giddiness.
It'd be much more profitable if you devoted yourself to military affairs.
Sire...
- I don't know the reason why...
- You're too smart, Volkonsky.
Beware, Prince, you had let yourself get carried away with matters that don't concern you when you were in Paris.
True, I myself had encouraged those extravagant dreams, and even ordered to draft a Constitution.
Though I realize now that it's of no use in an enlightened monarchy.
Nor did I rescind the ban on the society you're a member of.
And don't try to deny it.
The tyrant's blood will deliver our country of the autocracy.
We can't but agree with the Southerners' plan, Prince.
If, by the spring, the Tsar doesn't grant the Constitution he'd promised...
And what if he doesn't?
Gentlemen, I will wait until 1926, and, during a review of the troops, confess my guilt.
The Tsar will have me executed.
But he will grant Russia the statutes you failed to obtain.
The thunder will strike, gentlemen!
Perhaps I deserve to be condemned...
If something goes awry,
I hope you will at least try to understand us.
Us?
Oh God, us?
Maria!
What is it?
Oh, God, what does it mean?
Maria! 
Masha!
Oh, my God! 
An omen!
It's an omen!
A bad omen!
O Lord! 
Forgive me!
She must be by the swing.
Maria!
Mashenka!
Masha, hush, hush...
Nothing really happened.
Calm down.
I could never imagine such a thing.
Enough, Mashenka, calm down.
It was really nothing.
Come on, what's the matter with you?
Turn back!
Turn back, Your Excellency!
They put a guard at your house.
Don't go to Uman!
A courier from St. Petersburg...
He brought the Tsar's order about your arrest...
Turn back, Your Excellency.
It's too late to turn back.
Ippolit!
Ippolit, please.
Here, these are my letters to my wife.
Distribute them, so that they are sent from different places.
My wife is still too weak.
I want her to learn about it as late as possible.
Yes, sir, I'll do it.
Go!
By the winter of 1825-1826, the Russian gentry was deeply divided.
The accession of Nicholas I, to replace the dead Emperor Alexander, was marked by a revolt.
Who is going to report about me to the Tsar?
Are you joking, Captain?
There's been no order to arrest you.
On the day of taking an oath of allegiance, you were in the barracks.
Isn't that so?
But I joined the rebels when the guns were aimed at them.
You're slandering yourself.
I was a member of the secret society, and I must share their fate.
He's lost a lot of blood, and had nothing to eat for two days.
He gave up his sword of his own free will, but when he was led to the guardhouse, he offered resistance, and, therefore, was tied up.
In view of his hunger swoon...
He's been wounded. 
Let him remain seated.
I knew it would be you here.
You said, exterminate the august family? 
Was it you?
No, I never said it to anybody.
Let him eat.
I never said it to anybody, but I've been thinking of it all the time.
Stand up!
Insulting the most august highnesses?
!
Excuse me! 
How can I insult their highnesses?
They have fortresses, the army and fleet. 
They fire with case-shot!
What do they care if I say:
you, Nikolai Pavlovich, are a pig?
How dare you sit in the presence of...
Scoundrel! 
Swine!
Scum! 
Scum!
Put him in irons, so he can't even move! 
Scoundrel!
You used to swear better when you were in the army.
Catherine!
- Whatever you may be told about us...
- Don't say anything!
Only God can judge you, Serge!
You and your friends.
Mister Ambassador, I'm sorry, the Russian officials are here, the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself...
What happened, Mister Minister?
So early in the morning at my house?
I'm very sorry to disturb you at this untimely hour, but your relative,
Prince Trubetskoy, spent the night at your house.
If the Prince remains at your embassy, you'll be presented a note.
I have sent for the Prince, but if he doesn't wish to come out...
- It's so awful!
- I hope everything'll be all right.
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
The Emperor wishes to see you.
When?
Immediately.
What are you doing, Prince?
I hope, Ludwig, you will take care of Catherine.
Catherine!
What are you doing here?
You can expect anything from those soldiers!
Father, I beg you, tell me, where is Serge?
Trubetskoy is not here!
Where is Serge?
Go away, quick, these are the rebels!
The rebels? 
Here?
Where is Serge? 
I'm begging you!
Get away from here, quick!
Go now!
Do you have at least one company?
Your Majesty, the artillery swore their allegiance, the guns are out.
Your Majesty!
The Grenadiers are outside.
You'd better go back, Your Majesty.
These are the mutineers.
You're too late with your advice, General.
Good morning, boys!
Don't you recognize me?
Your Majesty, a company of the First Preobrazhensky Regiment is here.
But, through some misunderstanding, their rifles are not loaded.
- Looking for somebody, Lieutenant?
- For my company, Your Highness!
In that case, we'll make way for you, go ahead.
Open order!
Open up from the center!
Hurray for the constitution!
Trubetskoy!
Soldiers! 
Perhaps no one has ever seen me, or heard of me?
Who remembers me? 
Who knows me?
Tell me, soldiers, those who'd served with me don't remember either?
Neither the Moscow Regiment men remember...
Nor the Grenadiers...
But if I remind you in what battles I was with you... in what campaigns... where we were freezing in the snow together?
They probably don't understand to whom they should swear their oath.
For our Tsar! 
For our Motherland!
To the Tsar? 
Or to the Constitution?
Though I don't know what it means...
Who of you was with me at Kulm and Leipzig,
Amstetten,
Brienna, Prechampenoise and Krems,
Bucharest, Obelesti,
Lake Oberalt, at Tarutino,
Vilna and Borodino?
No one was?
Thank God! 
There's not a single Russian soldier here.
If there was at least one officer, or one soldier here, then you would know who Miloradovich is!
There're only rookies here!
Brawlers! 
Vagabonds! 
Scoundrels!
You've shamed the name of the Russian soldier!
The honor of the military man!
You are a disgrace to Russia!
You are criminals betraying your Tsar, your Motherland, and God Himself!
What are you up to?
What are you doing?
On your knees before the lawful sovereign Nikolai Pavlovich!
On your knees, boys! 
All of you!
The general is wounded!
Yes, Eugene.
While sharing your views, we remain Loyal to the crown and our Tsar, whom we despise as a deceiver!
Dear Serge, habit is everything for a Russian man.
You said it yourself recently.
Prince Trubetskoy, are you familiar with these sheets?
Prince Sergey Petrovich! 
Answer me!
Manifesto.
"Save, O Lord, Your people, and bless Your heritage.
Abolition of the former rule...
Abolition of the right of ownership of human beings...
Equality of all classes before the law..."
The landowner, the merchant, the craftsman and the peasant - they all have equal rights?
Was it you who wrote this?
Please, try to remember.
"The Russian people are not the belonging, nor the property of a person, or a family.
The slavery of serfdom should be radically abolished."
This is your handwriting.
A revolution in Russia is as preposterous as a woman grenadier.
Why does a European bourgeois take a dagger in his hand?
To usurp the rights he doesn't have, to rob and pillage.
Even if it's a society like the Mason loge, I visited them, too.
A lot of noise, agitation and verbal determination.
But once they return to their homes, all is quiet again.
His Imperial Majesty the Tsar Alexander Pavlovich!
We're getting old, Miloradovich.
Russia needs new power, new energy.
We live in the hard times, fields are sown poorly for the shortage of grain.
Peasants' food is loathsome, there's no bread.
They're being sold by the piece, their families broken, wives corrupted, maidens robbed of their virginity.
And all this is done in the open!
The oppressors have no fear!
The gentry think they own the honor, property and life itself!
Negroes on plantations are happier than our peasants.
There are monsters who make peasant women breastfeed borzoi puppies.
Any member of the gentry who opposes the act of liberation cannot but be called the enemy of the country.
And the first and foremost enemy is the Emperor himself.
I'm tired.
I trust in God, for it is said:
I boast when I feel my infirmity, then the Lord will strengthen me...
Is that your hand?
Yes, mine.
What have you done?
What on earth have you done?
!
Prince Trubetskoy!
Of such a noble family!
Colonel of the Guards!
What was going on in that head of yours... when you decided to link your name to that filth?
Leave us!
Your fate is going to be horrible.
Horrible...
Such a lovely wife.
You've ruined your wife's life.
O Lord...
I could shoot you right away.
Life would be a shame and punishment for you.
Shoot me.
Levashov!
You're lucky, Sergey Petrovich, that you don't have children.
Come what may!
Don't be afraid, Mademoiselle, I've got a magic touch, we'll get through!
Somehow or other!
What the heck! 
By guess and by God!
You intended to shoot the fortress's whole garrison, Mademoiselle?
And all this because of Lieutenant Annenkov?
By the way, you arrived just in time.
Today your friend was taken out of the noose.
Oh, my God!
Wait! 
Where are you going?
Wait!
As you were!
Calm down, the towel had gone loose, he was brought to his senses.
You can't detain me. 
It's been two days since I left Moscow.
Two days, Monsieur.
You have no heart!
The Russians have changed so much!
As though the guillotine had been invented in Kostroma.
In your country, all the mutineers would have been executed long ago.
You're right, Monsieur! 
But they'd be entitled to have defense lawyers.
A petition for a visit must be handed in to the investigation commission, then it will be submitted for the highest consideration.
- Do you understand?
- No.
I could make it clear to you in Russian.
Monsieur, you're so strong, and I'm so weak.
And I have come as far as here.
Can it be that you, so strong a man, will not help me, all alone in a strange country?
That's all I've got left.
It was given to me by my mother.
Somehow or other!
Take what comes!
Troshka!
Your Honour!
Mademoiselle Pauline!
The life of a cavalry guard's not long, Hence it's the sweetest in the world.
The trumpet sounds, a bedspread thrown, And distant saber rattle heard.
The guitar sings without fading, Yet the commander rushes forth.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
At last.
Lieutenant, what are you doing here?
Excuse me, Mademoiselle, but I'm at my home.
What do you mean? 
Isn't that a coaching inn?
It's no tragedy. 
You'll take a night's rest from that bug-infested place.
I don't understand. 
Is that your house?
This is my mother's estate.
There's about 100 kg of silver here...
I'm scared being alone with roaches...
And crickets...
And on Holy Day, so much wine and smoking. 
What will your mother say?
Mother will have us flogged.
There's not a soul in the house except this deaf woman.
No one will disturb you here.
In vain you try prolong the story Of peaceful games with laughter filled:
You'll never come by a lasting glory Unless somebody's blood is spilled.
The sweet sublime world notwithstanding, Anxiety knit your brow doth.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
Twenty kilometers on foot are a dubious pleasure.
It's getting late.
It would be more prudent to come back.
Leave me alone!
I insist on it!
Oh? 
So if you don't love me...
What are you going to do then?
- I'll fight!
- With whom?
With anyone who dares to look at you!
And if it's not only one man?
I'll fight them all!
You'll get killed, and it will serve you right!
I love you like a madman!
Thousands of Russians and your compatriots lost their lives here.
There was war here in 1812.
Who knows, maybe my uncle's remains lie in these parts, he was the jolliest man in the world.
My uncle and my father served Bonaparte.
Your father fought against Russia?
No, he died in the Spanish Kingdom.
I was orphaned when I was not yet nine.
Stop it! 
These sounds have been giving me a shudder since I was a child.
My father hated Bonaparte.
Any royalist would've paid with his life for sympathy to the Bourbons.
Though any revolution means blood, orphanhood and suffering.
However, if there has been no shake-up in France,
I would have never met you in Russia.
Jean! 
I'll arrange for your escape.
I'll bribe the soldiers, I'll put the officer to sleep or poison him.
You'll go in hiding abroad.
I can't, I must share the fate of my comrades.
No, it's impossible!
I've already prepared everything!
I must share the fate of my comrades.
So much the better.
Fate has set everything straight and spared you the cruel lot of becoming the wife of a convict.
You're insane!
I would be happy to become the wife of an outcast if it could only alleviate your suffering.
Is it true?
God's servant loann plights his troth to God's servant Paraskeviya.
Are you joining this holy wedlock of your good and unconstrained will?
- Excuse me, what does it all mean?
- What do you mean?
We'll be right back.
Mademoiselle Pauline!
Can you explain what's going on?
Look, even if I were dying of hunger,
I wouldn't have married a bag of money.
Have a safe journey, Mademoiselle.
Goodbye!
So you don't like me?
Bravo, Lieutenant! 
At last you thought of such a trifle!
You're too arrogant!
I despise you!
An arrogant and conceited brat!
Oh, my God! 
What an idiot!
- Leave me alone! 
Go away!
- I don't believe you, Mademoiselle!
Shut up!
I hate you!
Is it true?
It's true, Jean, I want to be your wife.
No one can suspect me of mercenary intentions now.
Even those at the fashion house where I still work.
Your purse, Mademoiselle.
Listen... 
Listen, Jean...
Thank you, Pauline.
But I'm not worthy of your love.
You will meet someone you'll love.
You're going to be happy.
Forget about me!
Forget me forever!
Jean!
Jean, don't dare saying that!
I'll never be happy without you!
It's all over for me!
Goodbye!
I'll live in peace, and as the death angel cometh, I'll hold out my hands...
Mademoiselle, it's dawn already.
The mistress asks you to come in.
She wasn't receiving you, because they dined all night.
...I want to save a place for a man to whom I'll be inseparably tied forever.
Oh, my dear friend! 
What torments of grief my heart has experienced!
Oh, my lord, that's the end, very soon my brother will be united in wedlock with Miss Clementine!
Poor Henriette!
What a lot for a maiden whose beauty adorns the Universe...
I'm very sorry, Madame, but I must tell you that your son is imprisoned in a fortress.
Mademoiselle is saying that His Excellency Ivan Alexandrovich is in a fortress.
He must have gotten into debts again?
Madame... 
Madame...
His life is in danger.
Listen to what he's written!
"I don't even have a pin at hand, with which to put an end to my existence."
Ivan Alexandrovich wants to kill himself.
That will make our relatives so happy, they will get everything, scoundrels.
Only you can afford to buy a foreign passport for your son.
And I'll arrange everything else.
Yes, the passport, the master must flee...
My son? 
A fugitive?
That will never be!
Your answer is fit for the Romans, but their time has gone.
Jean is a child.
Ivan Alexandrovich is a little child.
Some child, to have picked up that masonic pest from the French and wanting to marry a French woman.
Aren't you that French woman?
Strengthen us, O Lord, in our infirmity.
I was pierced to the bottom of my heart.
You should marry an English girl, not the Italian one.
Don't make the choice that may dishonor Clementine.
I've got a proud heart.
I want you to remember me with affection.
Neither the summer heat, nor the winter cold...
Mother, it's...
Mother, it's time for me to think of building a family.
And my spirit was exalted...
Who told you to come to Moscow?
Mother, I've got a bride.
Will you please hear me out?
Well?
.
Have you found her in St. Petersburg?
You saw her, but you probably don't remember.
She works here, at the French fashion house.
It was only I who knew you're a fool, now the whole Moscow will know.
May your gracious hand heal me.
Covering her delicate daughter with endless kisses,
Marquise had moistened her with her tears.
Mother, don't make me go to extremes.
My intention is very well considered, I won't give up.
Don't give up, you won't scare me.
You may marry even a peasant girl.
Are you depriving me of my inheritance?
Clementine was fascinated by your handsomeness. 
I don't deserve you...
- Mother, you mean you've cursed me?
- Get out!
You haven't given me your answer.
Fyodor!
Don't give horses to Ivan!
Let him get out of here on his own!
He takes after me, not like Grishka.
At least I have somebody to leave the inheritance to.
- Go and beg your mother...
- Listen, Fyodor...
Can one who's deprived of his inheritance be called a bag of money?
Oh, no, master...
Is it really so, master? 
Oh, God...
That's the answer!
Wait!
Come on, catch her!
What does it mean?
!
Leave me alone!
You abominable, dirty creatures!
Leave me alone!
Beasts!
Don't be angry.
You'll live here, you'll marry a general, and forget about my stupid son.
You know how many diamonds you're wearing?
They are worth a hundred thousand, or maybe even more.
I'll be giving balls.
Give back my dress.
So finicky.
Come on, Prince, it's not my intention to find you guilty.
On the contrary, I'm giving you an opportunity to justify yourself.
But my situation is unenviable when I'm not trusted.
Meanwhile, I'm only the first citizen of our country.
You took up arms against a friend of your cause and thus tied my intentions.
From the high position I'm placed at, one cannot but see that even if any particular persons were guilty, there had also been some general reasons for indignation.
A lot of people are involved.
It's more important for me to know that, than whether someone's guilty.
You have a wife, the daughter of Rayevsky.
Your son was born recently.
You may rest assured, Prince, your children are my children.
If you promise to be Loyal to the crown, I'll be able to forgive you.
Thank God, we thought something had happened to you.
How is she?
Did the doctor call?
Calm down, Prince, the doctor was here.
Though all was clear without him.
- What was clear?
- Fits of sickness are inevitable.
God willing, we'll have a grandchild in winter.
If you can, Sergey Grigorievich, please, don't leave me for long periods of time.
We never spend time together.
It's so strange, I don't know you at all.
Levashov!
Please.
I can pardon you, Prince Sergey Grigorievich.
That's the trouble that you can do anything, you're above the law.
And I would like your subjects to be dependent on the law, and not on your will, caprices or momentary moods.
Put him in irons!
Incarcerate as a villain!
He's a complete fool, that Prince!
Or a liar and an utter scoundrel...
There you go, little prince!
There you go, Mikolushka!
Mikolushka! 
That's a boy!
Yegor!
- Why is this door locked?
- I was told to lock it for the night.
Then unlock it.
Yes, Your Excellency, we'll report it to Alexander Nikolayevich.
Marie! 
Marie!
What's the matter?
Marie!
Hiding the mail from me? 
I learn about the winter troubles from hearsay.
Not a single letter from Sergey.
And now this house arrest!
What are you talking about, Marie?
The prince is probably at the Turkish border. 
Father will come and tell us.
Father is in St. Petersburg, not in Bessarabia.
I'm tired, Alexander.
Since the first days of this awful year I've been so depressed, and you're indulging me with some inventions.
It doesn't befit our friendship.
It's even cruel.
Please, understand, no torture can be worse than uncertainty.
If you don't tell me now where Sergey is, I'm going to St. Petersburg.
And you know me, I don't waste words.
Sergey Grigorievich...
how shall I put it...
What happened to him?
Well, all right...
He has been sent to St. Petersburg.
You see...
Say it!
He took part in the antigovernment conspiracy.
Thank you!
- How shall I announce you?
- Colonel Pestel.
Come on in, be so kind.
Please accept our deepest apologies for intruding at such a late hour.
- Something happened?
- We have to be in Uman by morning.
Allow me to introduce Prince Yablonovsky and Mr. Grodetsky.
- You'd better spend the night here.
- It's out of the question, Prince.
We must go to Warsaw immediately.
The Polish Society is waiting for our answer.
Just married and now back to my regiment?
There may be not another such opportunity for a year or longer.
When and where?
Tomorrow in Uman, at your apartment at 1 p.m.
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you. 
I knew I could rely on you.
Marie!
Thank you!
Are you glad?
There's no such awful thing Volkonsky hadn't been involved in.
He has a fortress in store for him, or even more horrible... hard labor.
The most horrible is behind us.
Now he will need me.
The night of July 12-13, 1826.
These state criminals condemned to political death,
upon being deprived of ranks, orders and the status of nobility, are to be exiled to hard labor according to the categories.
Lieutenant Annenkov! 
Stop it!
- What is it?
- It hasn't been cut out right!
Proposed to deprive the Emperor and his Imperial family of freedom when seizing the palace.
Directed the Northern secret society which plotted mutiny.
Agreed to be named the head and ringleader of the army revolt, though did not participate in it personally.
Who could know there'd be such a delay with logs.
- And what's the problem?
- The cart broke down on the way.
Come on, men...
Let's take it down together.
We must do it together.
The ropes are too short!
Such a bad luck...
What happened?
Bring him here right away!
What have you been sent to Russia for?
You have no executions anymore.
Where did your Swedish brains look?
We'll have to wait, Your Excellency.
Mouzhik do mistakes.
Poles not deep.
Bring benches, quick!
What a miserable empire!
They can't even hang people properly.
Bring the Commandant to His Excellency!
If we don't act, we'll deserve to be called scoundrels.
That I would consider a failure!
We must only start, this is in our power.
Military bravery and political foolhardiness are not the same thing.
In the present circumstances, an uprising means death!
Yes, we will die, but we'll set an example for the others.
...To put to death
Pavel Pestel, Kondraty Ryleyev, Sergey Muraviev-Apostol,
Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin and Pyotr Kakhovsky, as determined by the court verdict.
For their heinous deeds, these criminals are to be hanged.
What day is today?
O Lord, stretch forth Thine hand on Your servants.
Pardon their transgressions, deliver their souls, O Lord, in Your realm!
Give me your hand.
Listen... does my heart beat faster?
Give my husband back to me!
Give my husband back to me!
Don't make him perish!
Nastenka! 
Beg father!
Beg him, Nastenka!
Beg him for yourself and for me!
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, who has left His commandments to His disciples and apostles...
Where's the Commandant?
Your Excellency, a message from His Majesty!
His Highness summons you to his side!
Hangman! 
Oprichnik!
Take off your aiguillettes!
Strangle us with your aiguillettes!
They may be more durable!
Yes, Your Excellency!
Have you come here to watch us dying, General?
You can make your Tsar happy, his wish has come true:
we're dying in torments.
Hurry up, hang them!
The ropes are no good!
We should send for the new ones.
I'm dying in torments!
But I'm happy that I'm dying twice for my Fatherland!
Ones who broke loose were pardoned in Russia. 
Shall we inform the Tsar?
.
Hang them!
Pardon them who hate us and hurt us, for not one of them will perish for us...
O Lord, You Savior of all through Your mercy, all-generous God, the Savior of all through Your mercy!
O Lord, all-generous God!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
It's done, Your Majesty!
We pay our particular attention to the situation of the families from which, by a criminal action, their fallen sons had been torn away.
Blood ties pass on to the descendants the glory of their ancestors' deeds, but never hold them up to disgrace for personal vices or crimes.
No one.
No one shall ever dare find fault for the blood relationship.
This is prohibited by the civil law, to say nothing of the Christian law.
What were you trying to tell me?
There's a pretty venomous opinion going the rounds, Your Majesty.
The cobbler in Europe rebels, because he seeks wealth and high standing.
And what on earth do our revolutionaries of noble birth want?
They must be dreaming of becoming cobblers.
Gen. Rayevsky shall be made a member of the State Council as a Senator.
Tell me, Prince, what's your response to the whim of my daughter?
You must tell Maria that you're rejecting her sacrifice.
Write about the hardships she'll experience if she follows you.
The letter must dispel her illusions, she'll lose hope and calm down.
You mean...
You mean she'll forget me?
Petersburg, Petersburg, Petersburg, Chernigov...
Will you repeat it, please?
Of course, to Princess Yekaterina Trubetskaya, English Embankment...
He hasn't gone a hundred miles yet, and already the third letter.
Prince Sergey, be a man, be a Christian.
You've ruined her life, at least don't become her murderer!
She has a frail health, she won't endure the horror of the journey.
Prince Sergey, don't be an egotist!
Your responsibility as father and husband...
Wasn't it your intention to abolish the autocracy?
And to replace the monarch with the conspirators?
Who told you all that?
If we are destined to be successful, the Society's members will immediately withdraw from political life.
Wait, Prince, you subject yourself cold-bloodedly to the danger of dishonor, shame, maybe even losing your life.
And if you're successful?
No reward for the risk?
All we could hope for is that our descendants remember us well.
And had my participation in the Society's cause stood in the way of my happy family life,
I would rather, albeit grudgingly, have renounced that happiness than betrayed my convictions and duty.
Oh, gracious God!
How could you go to the altar with such a sin in your heart?
Good night.
I'll do everything as you ask.
Goodbye.
May God save you.
I'm so sorry...
May God save you, martyrs to the truth!
It's 2,000 versts to Yekaterinburg.
Oh, my goodness!
About 7,000 to Irkutsk.
Unbelievable!
And 800 more to Nerchinsk...
Yes, Princess.
Byron. 
Plutarch.
I understand your feelings, Princess.
But in such matters I'm obliged to follow the established regulations.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Count Orlov's seamstress was allowed to follow her convicted husband to Siberia.
Have you been inspired by a common woman's act?
The seamstress was not losing much, whereas you...
The law cannot deprive a noble woman of what's allowed to a commoner.
By insisting on the rights of commoners, a woman of noble birth may reduce herself to...
Everything is ready, Count!
Catherine, my poor child!
To flee the French Revolution, only to give your daughter to a conspirator!
Support us, o Lord, in well-being and prosperity...
Save, Lord, thy servant...
Yes, Princess.
Let's go, with God's help!
Mommy, let's go!
Let's go, mommy!
Mommy, let's go!
Wait.
Your Majesty!
Wait!
Will you please speak Russian?
I don't speak Russian.
Come closer.
- What would you like?
- Hear me out, Sire!
Your Majesty, as a special favour, please allow me to join Lieutenant Annenkov in his exile.
Is he your husband?
I would have wedded him if I wished to transgress the bounds of propriety.
I've decided on that daring act after learning that Russian women who wished to follow their husbands found compassion in you.
But this is not your country, Madame!
I'll renounce my country.
Take her petition.
Your Majesty!
Stop, I beg you!
Europe talks about your mercifulness to the families of the wretched men.
A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country.
Europe didn't doubt my heart.
I'll give you the answer in 3 days.
To own serfs, to revel in luxury, and to consider oneself free?
For heaven's sake, gentlemen!
Will the life of our gentry forever stagnate from corruption and idleness?
Isn't that ignominy going to arouse shame and disgust in us?
What will you say, Lieutenant?
I'm ashamed of the class I belong to.
I'm a slave, just like my mother's house serfs.
The only difference is that I'm conscious of my enslavement.
Natalie, baby, where are you going?
Fedya!
Fedya!
Fedya!
Sometimes I even treated my old servant who adored me in the manner of a true son of my mother.
Where were you hiding, Fedya?
All right, I'm forgiving you this time.
Thank you very much, sir.
The other day your mother bought 100 yards of fabric for a dress.
Don't talk rubbish.
And it's not the first time.
As soon as there's an expensive fabric on sale, she buys it all, so that in all Moscow, and not only in Moscow, in all Russia, only she had a dress like that.
Ivan!
Oh, Our Lady in Heaven, save Vanechka from trouble!
Brush it up.
Stop jerking the comb!
Let me see.
All right, leave that lock there.
I'm sick and tired of you, Ivan.
The last time you killed someone in a duel, now you've lost 60 thousand.
Tomorrow morning you're going to St. Petersburg.
I'm not giving you any cash.
You'll be fed by Fedka on your way.
I myself will pay your debt.
Don't dare meet your brother.
Come on, kiss my hand!
And don't dare coming to me in Moscow without my permission!
Sir Roland squeezed her hand...
Oh God, the same pleasantness, the same loveliness on that dear face.
"Don't squeeze my hand so, Sir Roland," I interrupted his speech.
"You will sadden me if you make me repeat..."
Mademoiselle Pauline!
Champagne is poured in a flow, And misty view somewhat obscured,
With everything, just take and go, With everything as if for good.
A wooden cross it'll be, or leaden, With which to death we're betrothed.
Don't ever promise to a maiden Eternal love on our earth.
Only inequality stood between me and her.
You may not believe me, Sire, but my arrest had even made me happy.
The barrier that stood in the way of our union with her has disappeared.
At last I'm stripped of all rights, of my fortune, of my status of gentry.
Wait!
Stand back!
I would gladly pardon you, Cavalry Guard.
Only tell me, since you knew of the conspiracy, why didn't you report it?
Did you hear the question?
Answer it!
Well?
.
It's not honourable to report on your comrades.
What do you know about honour?
!
- Do you know what you deserve?
- Death, Sire.
Do you expect to be shot?
And cut an interesting figure?
No.
I'll make you rot in prison.
What are you doing?
!
What's on your mind?
And you, why didn't you watch him?
What for?
I'm not going to live.
- Faster!
- We can't go faster than that...
Hurry up, please!
Quick! 
Go!
We need to change horses, and where can we get new ones?
- Here.
- Thank you very much.
Somehow or other.
Come what may! 
Faster!
We'll get you there!
Jean!
Jean!
Wait! 
Stop!
Jean! 
Jean!
Don't leave!
The Emperor's answer!
- How long will we stay here?
- I guess we can fix it in a week.
Seven days?
!
It's been badly broken, Your Excellency, we rode like crazy!
We'll have to travel by relay horses.
- But it means a springless cart.
- Other people use it.
People? 
Only mouzhiks and convicts.
- Did they carry them on carts?
- Sure thing.
God will help us.
What's the matter, Charles?
Madame, think about your parents!
I promised them that we return if the journey is dangerous.
I'm in despair! 
Why didn't I convince you to spend the night in Tomsk?
I've seen a wolf!
Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna has ordered to take you to Tomsk.
I've got the money for our journey to St. Petersburg and your salary.
She took her carefully and brought her home, made a little nest, just like for Mikola Sergeyevich,
put Katechka in there and went to the woods to pick mushrooms...
"I'm always under surveillance, even more strict than in a fortress.
You must obey your sense of responsibility.
You're a mother and a daughter.
I'm ready to sacrifice everything, if only it will give you peace.
My precious friend Marie!
Whatever you may decide, and even if this decision will deprive me of the hope of ever seeing you, that sorrow of mine will be alleviated by the belief
that you fully partake of my plight and that your decision was caused by the cruel circumstances."
I don't believe it!
I'll never reproach you for anything.
Darling Sergey!
Nikolai Pavlovich questioned me at some length about the prince.
Of course, I tried to vindicate Sergey as well as I could.
But it was impossible to belittle the prince's guilt.
The Tsar even said that Volkonsky is unworthy of our sympathy.
I wouldn't have stopped to extirpate my respect for him and consider my daughter's obligations annulled.
But I understand her: nothing is worse than eternal separation from him.
Don't worry, father.
I have no other troubles except those that concern Sergey.
I guess one has to have a stronger willpower, not to devote oneself to those who need it.
I know I will be able to endure anything being beside Sergey.
You want to bury yourself alive?
In the name of what?
Volkonsky is a conspirator!
Your foremost duty now is your son!
You're going to kill your son!
Enough!
Only a year ago you were persuading me of my fiance's virtues.
And today you deny me a consolation.
I want you to know that I love my husband.
And I expect from you at least a little compassion.
You're deceiving yourself.
You don't feel anything for him.
I guess it's the Volkonsky women's letters that speak for her.
Oh, God...
And first of all, his mother's, who'd gone out of her mind long ago.
They convinced her she's a heroine, and she tortures herself like a fool.
Look, Masha, if I knew that you were going there for love, that your delusion would not dissipate,
I would have agreed to bury you alive.
I would've wept over you with tears of blood and let you go, nonetheless.
I can use my power to stop you.
But, please, stop yourself!
Coming to your senses in Siberia would be a tragedy for you.
Have pity for your father, Marie!
Masha!
Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna!
Welcome!
You're the last person I expected to see in this house.
Governor Tsejdler at your service.
Please, have a seat.
Allow me to remain standing.
I understand. 
It's no laughing matter:
so many versts on our bad roads.
- Pafnuti!
- Yes, I know, Your Excellency!
Could you tell me... why I was not given horses?
There must be none.
It's strange, because the postmaster pleaded some ban.
Yes, yes, yes... 
Excuse me.
You see, I must inform you about something.
If you wish to proceed to Nerchinsk,
I'm obliged to inform you of the measures to be applied to you.
If I wish?
You think I've gone all that way just to meet you here?
Nevertheless, you'll have to hear me out.
Are you aware that all this will have to be sent back?
Nor are you allowed to take with you any sums of money or valuable things.
But that is not all.
Your right to own serfs will be revoked as soon as you move beyond Irkutsk.
So your servants will not go with you.
All right, they won't.
I suspect, Princess, that you...
You have no idea of what your life at the mines is going to be like.
You will live there like the poorest peasant.
Really?
The huts are dirty, stinking, full of insects.
Your food will be bread and kvass.
I hate to mention the climate: it's horrible, it'll be pernicious for you.
But I'll be there with my husband.
You're right.
But don't forget, Princess, that your husband is in prison.
You'll be allowed rare visits, once a week, no more, for one hour in a convicts' room, with an officer present.
I see... one hour...
an officer... present...
Please, order them to give me horses!
Have you fully realized that all the rest time you'll be alone among the savage population?
In the barracks you'll be surrounded by 5,000 branded convicts belonging to the most corrupt and despicable class.
But the mines must be managed by someone?
The management won't be able to protect you from insults which may even come to violence.
Aren't they punished there for crimes?
Princess, hardened villains fear no punishment.
They will even deem it right to consider you their equal, as the wife of a criminal sharing their lot.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, the samovar is boiling.
Would you like some tea, Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna?
This beverage is indispensable here.
God will help me.
Will you tell them to give me horses?
Please!
As you wish, Princess.
Written here is everything I've warned you about.
Your signature will mean you'll submit to all those measures.
Now can you send me on my way as soon as possible?
I'm sorry, Princess, but this paper has to go to St. Petersburg for His Imperial Majesty's consideration.
By courier.
How long am I supposed to wait, General?
A month one way, a month back.
And how long it will take the Tsar to look into it and give his answer... that, as you may understand, does not depend on me.
Will you wait?
Or prefer to go back home?
Oh, God!
Don't torture yourself, Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna.
You're pure before God.
Where are you going, Madame?
Have pity!
We were told not to let you in!
Don't you hear? 
Have mercy!
I didn't think I would ever enter your house again.
However, before going to Siberia,
I want to give you an opportunity to regain your son's favour.
Madame has learned that her son, Grigory, was killed in a duel.
Oh, my God...
Wait.
Get out.
I see you're not of the weak kind, Mademoiselle.
But it's hard for a foreign woman to take a journey to Siberia. 
Don't go.
I'll buy you a house in Moscow.
You'll have everything.
Only don't leave.
As soon as I'm dead, our relatives will take possession of everything here.
My son is young.
It won't be too hard for him.
His mother needs you much more.
It's impossible.
I know how scrupulous you are.
Take it, it will come handy in Siberia.
Give your support to Ivan.
I'm surrounded by monsters here.
The moment you leave, they'll poison me.
I'll pray for you!
Ivan doesn't deserve such a beauty.
Sure thing, dear mistress...
He doesn't deserve her, mistress, a rake what he is...
Hold your tongue!
Thank you most humbly.
She must pray and pray for Vanechka, that French trash!
As for taking your son with you...
As for taking your son with you...
Mommy!
...It can't be permitted...
can't be permitted...
Mommy!
All my prayers are about my son, Our Lady Mother of God!
I already love the child who hasn't been born yet.
I would sooner feel affection for my husband when I see his likeness in a child, his flesh and blood.
Help me, O Lord, help me...
To admit these feelings for the father of my future child...
It's a sin! 
A sin!
- Have you delivered mail?
- Just as you said, sir.
- Is Masha in her room?
- She went up to the children's room.
Did you call me, father?
I was playing in the garden.
Sit down, Masha.
Prince Sergey Grigorievich Volkonsky asks for your hand.
The prince is a fine man, from a good family.
I'm sure you'll be happy with him.
I gave him my consent and I hope you'll do likewise.
- But, father, I don't know him.
- The wedding's in a month. 
Now go.
My son is happy.
My husband is unhappy.
My place is beside my husband.
Marie!
What will happen to father, Marie?
What have we done to deserve all this?
I will curse you, if you don't come back in a year.
Come back soon!
We all will be waiting for you, Masha!
She has shed not one tear.
She's the most remarkable woman I've ever known.
Why not retire and enjoy the family life, raising children?
Dear Serge!
I haven't seen the Emperor for a while, and I must admit that my feelings toward him have changed.
Should you see him, tell him the princess remembers him.
You got more cheerful, dear cousin.
When you arrived in Italy, you looked so sad.
Russian women don't like to travel.
The Russian woman's attachment to her home is unequaled.
The hot springs of Italy did you a lot of good.
You won't believe me, but the doctor has been so reassuring.
If we're to believe him, it won't be a year before I can give Sergey a little angel.
I'll pray for you.
...Tomorrow, my dear guest, you must hear his opera.
Did you want to see me?
Here I am!
- I hope I didn't disturb you?
- No, I've finished already.
Don't forget: tonight we're invited to the duchess.
Why sit here for no purpose?
He is not at home!
Whenever His Excellency gets ill, he stays at his doctor's.
Getting all kinds of rubbings-in and poultices. 
He can't travel after that.
He must be staying overnight there, or he would've been here already.
You shouldn't have waited, Your Excellency, it's night already.
Montesquieu. "Persian Letters".
I would have brought it to you.
Please!
Too bad I couldn't receive you again.
I'm not well, I only got up because of an urgent matter.
Besides, as you know, the Emperor's answer hasn't yet...
All right... all right...
I have no good news for you, Princess.
If I'm not mistaken, this is your tenth visit here, isn't it?
Excuse me, the eleventh.
You see?
.
Where's my letter, General?
Where's the paper I signed?
- Couldn't the answer get mislaid?
- Oh, no, the courier...
You see?
God knows I didn't want to bother the Empress.
Pafnuti!
- The paper?
- Waiting, as you said.
Send it this week.
No, next week.
Shall I send it on Tuesday?
Friday.
Friday will be just right.
It will be just right on Friday.
Yes, yes, yes...
Friday is just right.
Or take the varieties of Little Russia...
Or rennet, for example...
This was planted exactly in the year that Masha was born.
What did my sister's nail mark here?
It's better to doubt nobility than virtuousness.
A coal-miner's wife deserves more respect than a prince's mistress.
How did you like the prince?
You aren't matchmaking for me, dear brother, or are you?
Well, Prince Volkonsky is one of the best eligible bachelors in Russia.
Maybe I'd better wait for a more modest suitor. 
Why hurry?
I'd sooner run away than become the wife of a titled dandy.
Grief's constant sister...
Grief's constant sister...
Hope is high...
Hope...
Hope...
Hope.
Doesn't he love his Fatherland who makes sacrifices for his convictions, who is ready to mount the scaffold for them?
Doesn't he command respect for the only reason that he ventured a new cause before its time came?
Let's go, Your Excellency.
Get in, be so kind.
Your Excellency!
I was ordered to overtake Your Excellency.
A message from St. Petersburg.
Will you read it, please?
The wife of a state criminal is not to leave the place of exile before her husband dies.
Even after his death, the government takes no obligation to permit the widows of criminals to return to Russia.
Thank you.
Now tell me, how far is Yekaterinburg?
Two hundred versts, Your Excellency.
How come, Your Excellency?
Wait, I'll announce you.
But I don't know if he'll receive you.
Dear sir, you have received the answer last week.
Stop your evasions!
You know about the letter as well as I do.
Really, Princess?
But I haven't read it yet.
Too bad, I didn't have the time.
Then read it, dear sir!
Certainly I will read it.
But I receive a lot of mail from His Majesty which concerns not only you.
- Maybe in a week...
- Sir!
You've been keeping me waiting for almost six months!
Well, as you wish. 
Pafnuti!
You may read it.
At least read what's required of you.
I don't care, and you know it.
You're wrong.
You're very wrong, Princess.
A wife, following her husband, will share his fate and lose her former title of any rank, that is, will be recognized as no other than an exiled convict's wife.
At the same time, she agrees to take any distress that such a position may involve, namely:
children that may be begotten in Siberia will be enlisted as factory peasants... with no right of inheriting either the property or name of their father, for they will be registered as serfs.
You shouldn't have tortured yourself so.
Had you listened to me in the first place, you would've been home now.
And your parents wouldn't have pined for their daughter.
Is that all?
Can I go to my husband now?
Be so kind as to make arrangements for the horses.
Have you ever seen convicts in irons?
Answer me!
Why are you shouting?
Who gave you that right?
You gave it to me!
You're the wife of an exiled convict.
You yourself will be sent to Nerchinsk as a convict.
With your hands and feet in irons.
You will go with a group of convicts under convoy.
You will be tied up with the rest, as villains are, so that... they don't escape.
And one more thing: out of 500 men we send under convoy, no more than a third get to Nerchinsk alive.
Well?
Are you still willing?
I don't care, I just want to go.
Tell them to bring irons.
You will go, you will go...
I don't want to, I can't torture you anymore. 
I'm sorry, Princess.
I had been pressured to dissuade you by all possible means.
I just tried to scare you. 
I'll give you the horses, and may God save you.
The winter of 1826-1827 dragged on and on at the Blagodatsk mine.
No, no, let's go there.
You don't deserve the leniency you're accorded.
Leniency?
Using you in the works is a leniency to your sin.
You must prove your obedience by modesty and good behaviour.
I'm not well, and you know it, my good man.
Did you come here to take treatments?
Stand up when you're spoken to!
There, we're awake.
My dear Alyonka is awake!
Now we'll eat, we'll eat...
My Goodness!
Your cheeks have frozen!
Now, have patience, mistress.
At last we're in the Promised Land.
Halt! 
Where are you going?
No one is to go in here.
Is Prince Volkonsky kept here?
There're no princes here, only convicts.
I have covered 7,000 versts to see my husband.
Run fast!
I pray the commandant wouldn't come here.
Oh, God! 
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!
A year later. 
Spring, 1828...
Do you, Praskovya, take this loann, whom you see in front of you, as your husband, of your good and unconstrained will and firm conviction?
Mademoiselle Gebl, do you take Jean to be your husband?
Yes!
Come what may!
My congratulations, Madame!
Hurry up!
Where are you taking him, the poor man?
I forgot to tell you...
I want you to know...
Stand back!
How dare you speak not Russian?
I don't understand...
You pledged yourself to speak only Russian!
Stand back! 
Are you deaf or what?
Don't dare!
I'll kill you! 
Don't dare!
Don't dare touch her!
Scoundrels!
Bastards!
Onward, the Fatherland's sons!
Shut up!
Our hour of glory is coming!
We're against tyranny!
I told you, shut up!
It does you no honour.
Restrain your heroes, General.
Stop it!
Madame, tell me everything you wanted to say and I'll pass it on to your husband in the language which is prescribed.
I wanted to say, General, that I'm very happy.
Your wife asked me to tell you that she's absolutely happy.
Go!
The End

(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
Here!
No!
(DOOR OPENS)
GREG: 
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
I was wrong, Jeannie.
I thought you were the kind that survived just to spite me.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(GASPS)
Oh!
(COUGHING)
You have to help me, please!
(SOBBING) I can't do anything by myself.
The tractor went over, he's pinned underneath and I can't get him free.
Come with me, please. 
Please!
-Where is he?
-At the quarry.
I tried to pull him free but I couldn't move him.
It's on top of his legs.
He's in terrible pain.
You'd better get in.
What happened exactly?
We'd unhitched the trailer and he was turning the tractor.
Went over on its side.
-He's unconscious.
-That's probably just as well.
It's lifting clear.
Yeah, but I need another couple of inches.
Put your arms underneath his shoulders and just try and gently ease him out.
Just pull him gently.
Here we are.
(PANTING)
ANNE: 
Can we get him to the hut?
Well, we'll just have to.
Just grab hold of his feet.
As gentle as you can.
All right.
Have you got some sort of drug amongst this lot? 
Some kind of painkiller?
Have you got some brandy, then? 
Whisky?
In the trailer.
We got some on the last trip.
Yeah, would you get it?
'Cause he'll need something.
He's gonna be in a lot of pain.
And scissors? 
You got any scissors?
(BOTTLE BREAKS)
Is it very bad?
Yeah, well, legs are broken, bones smashed.
God knows what we'll do about it.
Splints or something.
Well, you bind on splints, don't you?
I don't know anything about first aid.
Well, he's needs a damn sight more than first aid.
I mean, his bones have got to be reset.
Properly.
And I don't know how to do it. 
Do you?
Well, whatever we're gonna do, we better do it while he's still unconscious.
Because when he wakes up, he's gonna be in agony.
I could do with some of this myself.
-There are some cups somewhere.
-Oh, it doesn't matter.
Your family dead?
My father. 
Roger, my brother.
I had two days when I felt awful.
Daddy had sent the servants away, so there was nobody.
Then I felt a bit better and got downstairs.
Can you open this? 
It's a bit tight.
Do you know, I'd never seen a dead person before.
(COUGHS)
(GIGGLES)
It's warm.
Champagne's disgusting when it's warm.
How about you?
My wife died.
I'm sorry.
-Were you with her?
-No, I was in Holland.
Well, I'm an engineer.
I was working on land reclamation.
-Was it bad there?
-Well, it was slow at first.
Just a few people sick, we all thought it was some kind of influenza bug, but then people started dying, and all in a rush,
I mean, hundreds of them.
Nothing happened to me. 
I was all right.
Same for him. 
He wasn't touched by it.
He told me everybody he knew had died, and he wasn't even touched by it.
-How did you get back?
-Company helicopter.
Rotterdam was burning, just miles and miles of fire.
Oil tanks going off like bombs.
Oh, I'd never seen anything like it in my life.
And I came down the coast as far as Calais and...
All the way down I saw nothing, no people, no traffic.
When I stopped at Ostend to get some fuel, that was the only place that I saw anybody.
Just a man and two children.
I tried to talk to them but they just kept moving away, wouldn't let me near them.
Well, I suppose they thought I was carrying the disease.
Then I waited for a day and a night for the weather to calm down.
Then I came across the Channel.
Where were you going when I stopped you?
Nowhere.
Just driving.
(GROANING)
Now, well, if we're gonna do something about putting splints on him,
I suppose we'd better make a start.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(HORN HONKING)
(HONKING CONTINUES)
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
What do you want?
Keep away from this car, it's mine.
You're the first person I've seen.
The first one for days!
Yeah. 
Well, I've seen people.
They haven't seen me, though.
I'm keeping away from them.
I don't want their germs, see.
And that goes for you.
Clear off. 
Just clear off!
I've seen you before.
You were on the hill.
You had a sort of shelter.
-I talked to you!
-Oh, I remember.
Yeah. 
Well, it's like I told you then.
Stay away from people, you'll be all right.
Just keep away from everybody until the doctors clear it up.
For pity's sake! 
Don't you understand?
There aren't any doctors.
They died along with everybody else.
There isn't anybody left to get it cleared up!
That's only here!
The Yanks have something, don't worry.
In the war, they gave us the stuff then.
The Yanks'll fix us up. 
Don't worry.
Take me with you.
(CAR STARTING)
I don't want to be by myself any more.
Please! 
Please!
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
That's about as much as I can do.
God knows if it's gonna do you any good.
It hurts like hell!
Yeah, I know it does.
I'm sorry.
I just don't see what else I can do.
You need proper attention.
(PANTING)
You want one of these?
Is he going to get better?
I don't know.
Unless the bones are set properly, he'll be crippled for life.
He might be able to get around on crutches or something.
I just don't know.
It's going to be like this from now on, isn't it?
-Like what?
-Accidents!
Even little things.
A bad cut, burns.
Almost anything, they'll be really serious.
God help us if we get something as simple as toothache.
-How long do you think?
-Mmm?
I mean, how long before things start to get back to normal.
Normal? 
Never.
Not in our or several other lifetimes.
That's what he thinks, too.
It's gonna be very tough.
I suppose it could be.
For some.
What do you mean?
There's an abundance of everything.
Living may not be gracious, but it can be comfortable.
One way or another, I'm gonna make damn sure
I get my full share of everything that's going.
ABBY: 
Anybody there?
Hello?
Who's there?
ARTHUR: 
Stay where you are.
-What do you want?
-I saw the lights.
-You're on your own?
-Yes.
I saw the lights and I thought there might be somebody up here.
-I just came to see.
-You're not sick?
-Not got the sickness?
-No.
I was. 
I did have the disease but I'm all right.
ARTHUR: 
No. 
Stand where you are.
Now, what do you want?
Look, I told you. 
I saw the lights.
God knows, there are few enough of us left.
I haven't seen or spoken to anyone for the best part of a week.
-Look, if you want me to go, I'll go.
-Sure you're on your own?
Oh, for God's sake!
Just let me get in my car and I'll go.
All right, Dave. 
Switch the lights on.
I'm sorry about that.
Can't be too careful.
Had a little trouble earlier.
Well, will you come in?
I don't want my battery to go flat.
Will you turn off the lights?
It's all right, Dave. 
Nobody with her.
Oh, uh, this is Dave. 
Dave Long.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Arthur Wormley.
-Abby Grant.
Well, I'll take your coat.
Well, come on through.
We're in the kitchen.
We were just preparing something to eat when we heard your car.
Come on through.
(POT BUBBLING)
-Well, this is nice. 
Everything working?
-Oh, yes.
Stoves works off cylinder gas.
Generator for the electricity.
There's even water, pumped up out of the well.
You're very lucky.
Yes, yes. 
There can't be many places that are totally independent of outside services.
Oh, uh, would you like a drink?
We've got almost everything.
I'd love one. 
Vodka?
Yeah. 
Dave.
Anything with it? 
Bitter lemon, tonic?
Tonic, please.
Ice?
(CHUCKLING) Yes, please.
It all seems so normal.
Well, that's it, isn't it? 
That's it.
That's all we got to get back to, quick as we can. 
Back to normal.
Oh, you'll stay and have something to eat?
We're not the greatest cooks in the world but you're welcome to anything we've got.
Thank you.
I'll just have a look at the stove.
-Thank you.
-It won't be too long.
Thanks, Dave.
Now... 
Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have seen you before.
I'm sure we've never met but I've seen you before.
Well, it's likely. 
My picture's been in the papers enough times.
Arthur Wormley, of course.
The union man. 
Chairman, wasn't it?
Well, national president. 
I was.
There's nothing to be president of.
Well, not at the moment, anyway.
You must have been in close contact with government circles.
I mean, you must have been quite well informed when all this started.
Oh, just at the beginning.
Of course, they'd called an emergency meeting.
But everything happened so fast.
They issued some orders to the army, put up roadblocks, stopped people leaving the cities, but it's damn silly, really.
Finally they had to declare martial law, which meant that under certain circumstances the authorities could open fire to protect property or life.
That's awful.
Well, did it happen? 
Was there shooting?
Oh, I think so, during the first panic weeks.
After that, there weren't enough fit people to carry out the orders.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, come to that, there weren't enough people moving about to cause trouble.
So, there's no authority now. 
Nothing?
Well, not as such. 
Not yet.
But there will be.
There's armed people moving around all over the country.
Aimless. 
Lost.
They'll make contact with each other.
Start forming into groups.
Somebody's got to unite those groups.
Bring them under central control.
They'll want leadership, guidance.
They'll want somebody in authority.
Now, under the circumstances, it's up to somebody to assume that responsibility.
It's up to somebody to take the power to lead.
I'm not a church-going man.
Never one for religion.
I think God might have spared me to help those of us that are left.
That's my skill. 
That's my talent.
Organisation.
I think it's about ready.
Oh, good, good. 
I'm starving.
Well, bring it out then, Dave.
That looks marvellous.
Out of the deep freeze.
There must be enough for 10 there.
Would you like to wash up in the cloak room while we get this out?
-Oh, yes please.
-Okay.
I'll show you where it is.
-Second door on the left.
-Thank you.
Carve as much as we need, Dave, and take the rest out to them.
We'll have to get some more beds tomorrow.
There are plenty in the warehouse where we got that one.
We'll just have to make do for tonight.
There are plenty of blankets and pillows.
I'll make out a list in the morning.
Books. 
I'd like to get a lot of books.
It's going to be a long, dull winter with just the three of us.
Yeah, well. 
Look, Anne...
You two have got things pretty well set up here.
-Yes, it's not bad.
-But it's just...
Vic chose it. 
He said it was isolated and easy to defend.
He was going to bring some more of these portable huts down here on the trailer, so we'd have some storage space.
(GROANING)
Do you think you could get the tractor back on its wheels?
-Yeah, I expect so.
-Good.
Vic said we should go out every day and get things.
Right through the winter if needs be.
He said we should collect everything we could lay hands on.
-Yeah, that's a good idea.
-Yes.
Then later on, we might be able to find some people who'd be willing to work for us.
They could grow vegetables and things like that.
And we could pay them with food, goods, clothing. 
Things like that.
-Was that Vic's idea, too?
-No, I thought of that.
I don't think we're going to be too badly off.
You see, from now on money isn't going to mean anything.
The rich will be the ones who've got things
I'm sure there'll be plenty of people who'd be glad to work for a good meal or a warm coat or something.
Oh, yeah. 
They'll be queuing up.
Yes. 
In those terms, I'm sure we'll be quite well-to-do.
I going to have to get some sleep.
There's some blankets over there somewhere.
Yes, I went to the school.
But the master had taken some of the boys away.
Peter was one of them.
I don't know where they went.
Well, I hope you find him.
We'll need all the youngsters.
I might be able to help you later.
Oh, there must be a lot of people that had got separated.
As we contact the survivors, I hope to make a list of their names.
Where they're going, what they're doing.
I want to make this a sort of a clearing centre for information.
It's a marvellous idea.
It's something that'll be badly needed.
Well, we have to do what we can.
Now, what about you?
What about your plans?
Well, finding Peter is the most important thing, of course.
But at the same time, I'm looking for a place.
Somewhere to start a home.
A farm. 
A settlement, really.
You see, I think, we're going to have to start again.
Right from the beginning.
We're going to have to relearn all the old crafts.
Oh, I don't just mean growing food, and God knows, that's going to be hard enough.
But all the other things that we've forgotten.
Aren't you going to use anything that's left over?
Well, of course I will. 
I'll have to.
But the aim is to become more and more self-reliant.
To depend less on what's been left behind.
You're not making it easy for yourself, are you?
I mean, I agree with you about growing food, but the hardware of civilisation will last for a long time yet.
Of course it will. 
But not forever.
Don't you see the point we'd reached in our civilisation?
Now, look around you. 
Anywhere you like.
In this house, in this room.
I doubt if it contains a single artefact that was the exclusive creation of one person.
Well, this table.
This simple wooden table.
Well, I'm no carpenter, but I reckon
I could knock up something like this.
Right from scratch?
You'd fell the timber? 
With what?
An axe or a saw.
The steel for the saw has been made in a foundry, the iron ore has been dug from the ground, and the fuel to smelt it with has been mined.
Now, what happens when the last axe head cracks and the last saw breaks?
This simple metal knife is the product of hundreds of people in dozens of different trades.
And take anything else you like, anywhere you like, and the same will be true of it.
How do you make a cup?
A piece of paper? 
Glass?
Our civilisation had the technology to land a man on the moon.
But as individuals we don't even have the skill to make an iron spearhead.
We are less practical than Iron Age man.
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. 
It's just that I've thought about it a lot.
And with nobody to talk to, I haven't been able to say it out loud.
No, I'm glad you did.
You've thought about more deeply than I have so far.
And I'm sure that you're right.
You won't be able to start this settlement on your own.
No.
But I'm hoping there'll be other people who'll think the same way.
Oh, there will. 
It's a first-class idea.
And when you start at this commune of yours...
-Well, that's where I can help.
-In what way?
By making sure that you can get on with it without being interfered with by outsiders.
By bringing some law and order.
We've got to back to the rudiments of government.
Yours won't be the only settlement.
I should have thought it would have been a long time before we needed any sort of national administration.
Oh, believe me, it can't be too soon.
We've already started in a little way.
Locating food dumps.
Making sure that everything is shared out.
So one man doesn't corner the market.
If the distribution is handled from here, nobody will go without.
I'll make sure of that.
Oh, the beginnings will be small.
Perhaps just this area.
But as we grow stronger, we'll spread out, expand.
That's how the old feudal barons operated, wasn't it?
Perhaps.
But it's the way that ultimately led to the finest democratic system in the world.
I suppose.
It's just that I hadn't seen a political system as being one of our priorities.
Well, that's where you're wrong.
There's little groups forming already, trying to take over.
I told you earlier we'd had a spot of trouble.
Started the day we took this place over.
It's not your house?
No. 
We needed a headquarters.
That evening, a rat pack of toughs came marching up, led by an ex-army chap.
Called himself a colonel.
Said they were a vigilante force of citizens.
I offered them to join up.
It couldn't have been fairer.
Do you know what these army chaps are?
They won't let go one scrap of authority they've managed to grab.
He started raiding.
The last attack came just before you...
You arrived.
I gave them a taste of their own medicine.
They won't be back in a hurry.
Anyway, that's all over now.
Would you like a brandy?
No. 
No, thank you.
Well, uh, you're going to go on tonight or would you like a bed here?
There's plenty of room.
You must be tired with all that time on the road.
There is one thing I'd appreciate.
I noticed you had hot water.
A bath would be the greatest luxury that I can think of.
All the hot water you want.
All the hot water in the world.
I'll show you where it is.
(COUGHING)
(GASPS)
(GUNS FIRING)
(MEN YELLING)
Get them all?
There's three round the back, another one down by the road.
-Well, where's Phil?
-Oh, he's had it.
ABBY: 
Mr Wormley, I...
Go back, Mrs Grant.
We have assumed authority to maintain law and order in this area.
By what right?
The government announcement of a state of emergency and the introduction of martial law provides all the powers necessary to protect life and property.
Those powers are vested only in the recognised authorities
-of the services and the police.
-You are guilty.
You are guilty of leading an armed attack against peaceful citizens.
Peaceful citizens...
You have caused the death of a man carrying out his duty in defending this area.
Now, you men. 
Listen to me.
Having taken responsibility for this area, it is my duty, to administer such laws as are for the general welfare.
This man has committed murder.
We are completely within our legal right to pass judgement on him.
Not only our right, but our duty.
Now, is that clearly understood?
(MEN ASSENTING)
By the authority vested, in a declared state of martial law, the penalty for murder is death.
You will be executed.
The sentence will be carried out immediately.
All right. 
Take him away.
(SOBBING) This isn't right.
This isn't right!
No!
No, you have no right to do that!
You can't do that!
They're an armed gang trying to attack this house.
His execution is perfectly legal.
But you're murdering him!
Mrs Grant, we will never get back to any law and order while men like him are allowed to grab power.
(GUN FIRING)
Good luck with your settlement, Mrs Grant.
I warn you, without people like us to lead and protect you, you'll never get anywhere.
(CAR ENGINE TRYING TO START)
-Where are you going?
-I don't know. 
I'm not sure.
You're coming back though?
You will come back?
No.
But you can't go. 
You can't just go.
What about me?
I'm sorry. 
You'll just have to look out for yourself.
I can't! 
I can't manage on my own.
Look, if I can find dome drugs, some medicines, something that'll help him, then I'll come back.
But I'm not promising anything and even if I do, I'm not staying.
You've no right to leave me!
Get out of that car. 
Get out!
Anne.
Get me something to drink.
Shut up.
Shut up! 
Shut up!
(COUGHING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Where are you going?
You can't leave me on my own.
Stay here. 
Anne!
Please!
Don't go!
I don't have any definite plans at the moment.
Just drive around for a while, I suppose. 
See what's happening.
How about you?
I just want to be with people.
I thought I could manage. 
I've always been an independent sort of person.
But the last week...
The loneliness was more than I could bear. 
It was awful.
Yes. 
Well, I expect people to be starting to form up in small groups by now.
We'll find somebody for you.
Will you stay, if we do?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll take these pills and drugs and things down to the quarry.
After that, I think I'll just take it as it comes.
I've got the things you need.
They're in the boot.
I'll get them for you.
He's dead.
You'd better get in the car.
(CAR DRIVING AWAY)
Help me!
Anne!
Help me!
There's sure to be a petrol station somewhere nearby.
Ah, it's probably better to pick up another car with a full tank.
Anyway, there's no point in staying here.
Just grab your things.
It'll be dark soon.
There's no point in staying around.
May as well find a place to spend the night.
Come on.
(COUGHING)
Greg. 
Greg, look!
Let's find where it's coming from.
There must be people there.
It's hard to tell how far away it is.
I'm going there.
-What, now?
-Yes.
It's a signal, they must want people to see.
All right.
Anne.
Anne, come on, wake up.
We're moving out.
Leave me alone.
Come on, Anne. 
Please!
I'm cold! 
Leave me alone.
Look, Anne, it's up to you.
But we're going.
And if there's anybody there, we'll come back and pick you up tomorrow.
(FIRE CRACKLING)
I saw the fire.
I hoped somebody would.
You're the first.
Will there be others?

Where's Bob?
He called this meeting for 9:00.
- It's already 10 after.
- A shrink has no sense of time.
They're not really doctors. 
They don't deal with life and death like we do.
Listen, I've got a society nose job waiting in my office.
Hold it, Phil We should wait.
Bob said it was a personal matter.
- Probably needs our advice.
- Well, when he gets here... tell him my advice is to forget it, because when a marriage is over, it's over.
There's nothing wrong with his marriage.
If there was, he wouldn't come to you.
He'd come to me.
- Oh, really? 
What else could it be?
- Money.
I asked him to lend me a nickel for the parking meter yesterday... the man claimed he didn't have change.
Come to think of it, he's done that to me a lot.
Mm-hmm. 
Bob's broke.
That's not it. 
I borrow money from him all the time.
Well, then it can only be one thing- he is sick.
You know, come to think of it, he has looked a little pasty lately.
God, his marriage is over, he's broke, and he's gonna die.
Not his week.
There's someone outside to see Jerry.
- Who are you?
- I'm Gail.
- Where's Carol?
- She's on vacation.
Again? 
That's twice in two years.
Well, broads are all alike.
I object to the term "broads"
- I am a woman.
- Not really.
I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Look, I've been here before.
I can handle everything.
- Now, which one of you is Jerry?
- Me.
Okay, fine. 
What do I tell the person waiting outside to see you?
Look, whatever your name is, we are having a meeting here.
My best friend is in trouble!
- Who's out there?
- I don't know. 
Some girl.
Really? 
Well, I'll see you later.
- Pardon me, Gail. 
Is that your name?
- Yeah.
Just, how well do you know Carol?
Pretty well.
Did she ever tell you anything personal about Bob?
He doesn't pay her enough.
But she likes him anyway.
Bob called us here because something horrible is happening in his life.
And we wanna know what it is.
Well, I guess Carol should be the one to tell you this... but I understand that during a full moon...
Bob has a tendency to chase cars.
Maybe we should call in a vet.
Oh, hi. 
Sorry I'm late. 
I didn't have any change for the meter.
- I had to park on a side street.
- I knew it. 
You're broke.
Oh, no, he isn't.
Look at the man's complexion. 
He is sick.
You'd look sick too if your marriage was going down the tubes.
Is this my fear of sanity group?
Look, Bob, we were sort of speculating... on what's wrong with you, and obviously something is.
Nothing's wrong. 
I just wanted to talk to you about my sister.
- She's broke.
- She's sick.
Her marriage is down the tubes.
- Will you let me tell you?
- Well, Bob, get to it.
- We are doctors.
- All right. 
She-
She wants to do an article about us, and her editor gave approval.
I just wanted to know how you feel about it.
- Well, I hate it.
- And I love it.
- Why?
- Because you hate it.
Let me get this straight.
Your sister wants to do an article on a day in the life of a medical building.
Exactly.
Oh, that's perfect. 
She can talk to Dr. Harris, an adequate G.P.
Jerry, an average orthodontist.
And of course, Bob, a competent psychologist. 
And myself.
The Michelangelo of grotesque deformity... battling the plague and the scourge... epidemics of crippling ugliness.
And then there's Bernie for comic relief.
I resent that. 
Urology is an honorable profession.
Look, all I need is yes or no.
- Yes.
- It's okay by me.
- Well, me too. 
Except for one thing, okay?
- What's that?
I don't want anybody to tell her what I do.
I thought it was an honorable profession.
Well, that's no reason to shout it from the rooftops.
Nobody cares what you do, Bernie.
I'm sorry I'm late, Bob.
But that was important.
I had to interview a dental cleavage-technician.
That's all right, Jerry.
The meetings over.
So, what's the problem? 
Boy, you should've heard them talking before you got here.
They figured it could be only three things- either you're bankrupt... getting a divorce or dying.
Can you lend me 10 bucks?
- Yeah, sure, Jerry.
- Ten-spot.
Thanks. 
How's, everything going between you and Emily?
Fine.
- More coffee anyone?
- Yeah, I'll have some.
- More muffins too if you've got them.
- Happen to have them here, Morty.
- Can I have another, cup of coffee?
- Sure, dear.
Second cup of coffee.
- What did you just write down?
- Oh, it's not important.
Listen, Bob, I just want you to ignore me today.
I mean, forget that I'm your sister.
I'm a reporter.
- And you're a shrink.
- I'm back!
Come in, Howard.
It's open.
Ow!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, except for my knee and my- my shoulder and my forehead.
Yeah, but I don't wanna ruin your day.
I've learned to live with pain.
Would you like some bacon and eggs, Howard?
No, thank you. 
I'm in too much pain.
I'll have some- some toast though.
I'll have his eggs.
Who's he?
Oh, Howard, I'd like you to meet my photographer, Morty.
Oh, glad to meet you.
You guys do a real great job, you know.
I mean, without pictures in newspapers, newspapers would just be news.
- Honey, can I see you in the kitchen?
- Sure.
I was talking to Bob.
Oh, I'm sorry. 
When Ellen says "honey," she usually means me.
You know what I heard once?
A picture's worth a thousand words.
Would you pass the butter?
You know, Bob, if you're gonna have your picture taken today...
I don't think you ough to wear that tie.
Why not?
Ellen gave it to me.
She must've given it to you as a joke.
The reason you think it's a joke is because it's daytime.
I mean, at night, it glows in the dark.
Testing.
Testing. 
Testing.
You hear that? 
Why does everyone always say "testing, testing" when they're testing?
- Jelly.
- Well, I gotta go.
I've gotta go soaring off into the sunrise.
It's my job, soaring.
Are you gonna eat your toast?
No, no. 
Thank you.
Nice talking to you, Morty.
Well, it was a thrill for me too.
- I guess I'll go too.
- I hope everything goes well today.
Thanks. 
I'll ask him my first probing question on the way out.
Shoot.
You're not really gonna wear that tie, are ya?
Oh, come on, Morty.
We're leaving.
- You go ahead without me. 
I'll grab a cab.
- Morty!
- Oh, all right.
- Did you have enough to eat, Morty?
No, but we'll break for lunch early.
- Hi, Phil.
- I beg your pardon?
- "Hi, Phil." 
- It's Dr. Newman.
Let's conduct ourselves with a little decorum today. 
After all, this is press day.
- When will Carol be back?
- Soon, I hope.
This place is a snake pit.
Ah. 
Well, well, good morning, doctors.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
Sure, but try calling one in the middle of the night.
Oh, good morning, doctors.
Doctor, when do you think the press will get here?
Well, Doctor, I hope very soon... otherwise they're gonna have to vacuum your head again.
I wore this before at the last Christmas party.
Oh, that's right. 
You were doing the Mexican hat dance... and it fell on the floor, and everybody thought it was a tarantula.
Oh, look who's talking. 
I noticed you used a little eyebrow pencil this morning.
You're full of it, Doctor.
Some days his eyebrows just happen to be darker than others.
Well, if you'll excuse me, doctors. 
I have some important doctor stuff to take care of.
Got to fix my spit sink.
Well, good morning, Doctor.
And this must be your sister, Ellen.
How do you do?
I am Dr. Newman.
- I know. 
Hi, Phil.
- Oh.
Welcome, welcome, to the Rimpau Medical Arts Building.
Oh, well, thank you.
You mind if we get off the elevator?
Oh, certainly. 
Certainly.
And if there's... anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable... you just talk to Dr. Tupperman.
He's the little fella here with the tarantula on his head.
Oh, my God, Bernie.
What are you wearing?
Come on, Bob.
You've seen this jacket before.
Does anybody know how to load this thing?
- I can take a look at it.
- Oh, thanks, Bob.
Is there a coffee shop around here?
- Yeah, downstairs.
- Oh, fine.
Call me when you get it loaded.
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
Morty, you just ate a half an hour ago.
Oh, no wonder I'm so hungry.
Well, I guess I'll tape some interviews and have some pictures taken later.
Well, why not, start with plastic surgery?
Why don't we mosey on down to the face-lift factory.
You could start with me.
- My field is just as interesting as his.
- What is your field?
I'd rather not say.
Why don't we let her start where she wants to start.
I'm in 713.
I thought that office was abandoned.
There are more patients coming into my office than any other office in this building.
Never saw one come out.
Phil, take a hike.
Well, I have to go to makeup- I mean, to work.
Work. 
I have to, work.
I work down here.
Well, I guess I'll be going too.
Oh, Gail-
If the White House physician comes by with that specimen... be sure to buzz me, will you?
I wanna go home.
Well, Morty's camera is all loaded.
Why don't you come down to coffee shop with me and show him how to work it?
That's not a bad idea.
I'm starved.
Morty ate my breakfast.
Gail, can we bring you anything back?
Yeah, if you see a jelly doughnut.
Oh, and if we, see a Secret Service man with a bottle... we'll send him right up here.
What's going on?
I used to do divorce work.
- Hi, Jerry.
- Ellen, is that you?
Yeah. 
Listen, do you mind if I interview you first?
- No. 
No, go right ahead.
- Ah, terrific.
Ellen Hartley, Rimpau Medical Arts interview... with Dr. Jerry Robinson, orthodontist.
All right, first of all, Dr. Robinson, what is orthodontia?
What is orthodontia?
What is life?
I asked you first.
What is orthodontia?
Well, let's begin by saying... that it's not just fixing kids' teeth.
It's hard work, it's sweat, and, yes... a certain amount of spit.
- So, life is like spit?
- Exactly.
I wish I had a wider-angle lens.
Part of your nose is out of the frame.
Dr. Robinson, here's your m-
Well, what a surprise.
Ellen. 
You know... doctors do little favors like this for each other all the time.
It's called professional courtesy.
It's part of the Hippocr- the Hipp- 
- You know, that oath that we all swear by.
- The Hippocratic oath?
That could be.
Well, Phil.
I'm interviewing, Jerry right now.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I'll just get out of your way.
I won't bother you a bit.
All right, Jerry. 
How do you determine when a kid needs braces?
When his parents can come up with a couple of grand to pay for them.
- Will you butt out, Phil?
- Dr. Robin-
Gee, I'm awful sorry.
I didn't know that you had company.
I don't. 
Company is something that you invite.
Well, Jerry, remember that time you asked me about the history of urology?
- No.
- Well, I've done some research.
Napoleon had a urologist following him through every campaign.
Following? 
You mean leading.
And did you know that nonspecific "uritis"... claimed the lives of 15 Egyptian pharaohs?
I heard it was 14.
Tupperman, I didn't ask you about any of this stuff.
Well, maybe there's somebody in the room... from the news media who might be interested.
Oh, I am, Dr. Tupperman.
But not right now.
You know, the phones are all ringing off their hooks out there... but they're only patients, so I suppose it doesn't really matter.
What's the matter with you guys?
This is a working day.
Jerry, that girl is back. 
She said you were supposed to interview her at 10:00.
- That's tonight.
- She's early.
Hi! 
Nice to see you again.
Step into my, office.
Well, Ellen, it looks like we're gonna have a chance to talk.
What is it you'd like to know?
Excuse me.
I have to file some X-rays.
- Thank you.
- I am not only after one thing.
Have you seen my Phi Beta Kappa key?
I seem to have misplaced it.
No, I didn't spike your drink.
Is this Jerry Robinson's office?
Over here.
Jerry, there's a guy here to fix your spit sink.
Will you show him where it is, please?
I don't think you can get there from here.
Is this Candid Camera?
Are you Allen Funt?
Okay, let's have a nice, big group smile.
Hi, everybody.
Ellen, I'm glad I found you.
You left your comb in the apartment.
I thought you might need it.
Oh! 
My hand's stuck!
I wanna thank all of you for your cooperation. 
Come on, Morty.
Let's get something to eat.
I'm starved.
Hold on, Ellen. 
There's something you should know about warts.
It was 15 Egyptian pharaohs.
I can prove it.
I can't find my Nobel Peace Prize either.
That's, very nice of you to bring the comb.
- Well, I thought it might be important.
- Yeah.
If I were Carol, I'd go on vacation every week.
What are you, like a dentist?
- Orthodontist.
- What's that?
Orthodontia?
Well, it's a lot like life- hard work, sweat and, yes... a certain amount of spit.
I can see that.
You understand it's just a first draft.
I'm sure it's fine.
I mean, they'll be a lot of changes in it before it appears in print.
I can't read it with you looking over my shoulder.
Well, I just wanted to know what you think.
So far, it seems okay to me, except...
"Hartley" is spelled L-E-Y.
- How'd I spell it?
- L-Y.
- I did not!
- You misspelled it every time.
Well, it's my name too.
I can spell it whatever way I want to.
- How come I'm not mentioned?
- You are.
- Where is it?
- Right there.
- Where?
- Oh, yeah.
"Dr. Hartley is married."
Well, I am married.
I had Gail run off some copies for the other doctors.
- You, will let me know what they think?
- Yeah.
- Let's go. 
I'm starving.
- You sound like Morty.
- See ya later, Bob.
- See, it's right there on the door.
L
- E-Y.
Ellen, I just finished the article, and I think it is brilliant.
- It's... really honest.
- Gee, thanks, Gail.
Would you guys mind if I joined you for lunch?
- Sure. 
Come on.
- Thank you.
I, don't think I wanna be here when the doctors read the article.
Can I, buy anybody a sarsaparilla?
We read the article, Bob.
Oh. 
Oh, great. 
The, copies came out clear, huh?
- Very clear.
- Great. 
Great.
Beause, you know, sometimes they come out a little blurry.
I mean, usually they don't.
You know, I guess this time- is one of the times that they came out clear.
It's a real good copying machine.
We were-
We were real smart to invest in it.
You guys mad or something?
Mad? 
Why should we be mad?
Just because your sister made us look like a bunch of quacks?
She called me "a Hippocratic oaf."
She called me "portly and diminutive."
Where did she come off telling my age?
Said I spent the whole day trying to straighten out my love life.
It's not straightened out.
- Nobody came off well.
- Yeah, well, you did, Bob.
Sure, why not?
He's her brother.
She misspelled my name.
I don't want my mother to see this article.
But I want my lawyer to see it.
This thing better be changed before it goes to press, Bob.
Change it, or you'll rue the clay you rented space in this building.
Look, Ellen wrote that the way she saw it.
And, I'm not gonna ask her to change it.
And I'd be disappointed in her if she did.
You know what I think, Bob? 
I don't think you're man enough to stand up to her.
I think you're yellow.
You bushwhacked us, Bob.
You've got till sundown to have this article changed.
Bernie!
They went thataway.
It seems like Howard's been at that all-night newsstand all night.
Oh, he's so cute.
He's like an expectant father.
I just wish he'd get here.
Ellen, take it easy. 
You wrote the article. 
You know what's in it.
Oh, I know, Bob. 
But-You know, it's different when you see it in print... with all the spelling corrected.
You know, actually there is-
There is something I meant to talk to you about now that you've... you know, put the article to sleep.
- "To bed," Bob.
- Right.
Everybody at the office wasn't... altogether enthusiastic about it.
They wanted to change some things like, my face.
Yeah, I-
I reread it and made some changes on my own.
Oh, I'm really glad you did, because, you know... there were some things that even bothered me.
You know, like this part where you call Phil Newman...
"the sultan of silicone."
I didn't change that.
What about Dr. Harris?
Oh, yeah, I felt that I treated her with kid gloves.
So, I added that she was pretentious and seemed to be... more concerned with herself than with the practice of medicine.
Oh, She'll like that much better.
Did you change any of the stuff about Bob?
Yeah. 
I added that, "Dr. Hartley's therapeutic technique... was effective but unspectacular."
And I took out the crack about the ugly tie.
Told you it was ugly.
You gave me that tie.
I gave it to you as a joke.
Come in, Howard. 
It's open.
Oh, no, Bob. 
I'm not gonna fall for that again.
Come on. 
Let him in.
Let him in.
- Oh, that smarts!
- What happened this time?
I got hit by the newspaper when they threw them off the truck.
- Oh- 
- Are you okay?
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'm okay.
They say when you get old, you don't need your shins.
Don't worry about me.
Just read the article.
Well, I can't find it.
Here it is. 
It's in the "Good Neighbor" column.
Oh, yeah. 
Right next to the, shipping arrivals.
There we all are in Jerry's office.
That's not my article.
It's just a picture.
"Today's Good Neighbors."
"Doctors pitch in to help plumber Roland Snead, 44...
"repair a spit sink...
"in the true spirit of the Windy City.
Snead is left-handed and a widower."
I broke my shins for that?
I guess the editor didn't like it.
Or maybe there was a fast-breaking news story.
Yeah, yeah. 
That's it.
Here it is.
"Chicago may get azalea festival."
Hey, that sounds exciting!
Boy, maybe my shins will be better by then.
They will be, Howard.
They say your shins are the first to go.
Not in your case, Howard.
In conclusion, since I regard psychology as a serious... albeit unspectacular profession...
I cannot accept the invitation to attend... your Psychology Day picnic and carnival... nor will I participate as a contestant... in the primal scream-off.
Come in.
- Hi, Bob.
- Oh, hi, Morty.
Here are those pictures you ordered.
- You didn't have to bring them yourself.
- It's my pleasure.
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on my way to a fire.
Well, I appreciate it.
That's all right.
I do have a problem though.
I won't be able to take pictures of the fire unless-
Yeah, I'll load it for you, Morty.
Thanks, Bob.
You get it loaded, and...
I'll be in the coffee shop.

After all, it's only a horse race.
With half my horses and half my land bet on the result.
Think of how rich you'll be if you win.
If, if, if!
You insist on the race.
You make all the arrangements.
You demand the bet. 
Have you ever lost a race to any prefect?
There's always a first time.
[ Laughing ]
[ Chuckling ]
[ Yelling ]
My horse is leading.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ] Well, better luck next year!
[ Yelling ]
[ Yelling Louder]
[ Cheering ]
[ All Cheering ]
- There is a first time!
- Shut up.
- The horse threw a shoe!
- Who shod that horse?
The blacksmith.
I want that horse shod in time for the next race in the village of Venton.
If this happens again,
I won't just kill the blacksmith, I'll kill you too.
[ Hammering Metal ]
It's not necessary you work for the little food I've given you.
It wasn't necessary for you to give us the food.
I never talked to an ape before.
[ Chuckles ] Really?
Well, I mean, they talked at me, you know.
giving me orders, things like that.
But never just like you and I are talking.
Saying the things you feel like saying.
Well, would you believe, that, uh, it was many years before I spoke to a human?
Well, except for giving orders.
Well, why should apes give orders?
Why do we have to obey?
Well, there are two answers to that-- mine and, uh, the authorities.
See, mine isn't backed up by bullets.
I think you should listen to the authorities.
-[ Hoofbeats Approaching ] 
- Horses.
- Alan, Pete, horses.
- Stay here. 
You'll be safe.
[ Hoofbeats Approaching ]
This is Urko's favorite horse.
- He's thrown a shoe.
- I'll take care of him well, sir.
You will if you want to keep on living.
There have been reports of a young human riding a horse near here.
" Human riding a horse"?
They must be crazy.
Why would anyone take a chance on being shot,just to ride a horse?
Perhaps he's crazy as you say.
In any case, he'll be caught.
You know what the law is for humans riding.
You've been seen.
How many times have I warned you?
Being seen is not being caught.
Don't worry, Father, I'm careful.
You're not careful.
You just won't believe anything can harm you.
Well, the apes can, and they will.
You're not so smart you can go on fooling them forever.
I'm not trying to fool them.
I just don't see why I--
I don't care what you see.
I care about your staying alive.
I won't have you risking your life trying to prove how clever you are.
Now I want your word you won't ride again.
- Father, I can't.
-[ Galen Screaming ]
I've been bit!
[ Gasping ] It's a tiger scorpion.
Sit him down.
Here he goes.
- A tourniquet-
- Give me a rope.
- Right.
- It's no use.
- What do you mean, " It's no use"?
Without an antidote, the sting of the tiger scorpion is fatal.
- Where do we get an antidote?
- The clinic in town.
- I'll go.
-[ Boy ] It 's five miles.
By the time you get back, Galen will be dead.
Martin, I'm going to steal one of your horses.
You'd be caught before you got halfway there.
- Maybe not.
- I'll go!
- No, you won't.
If anybody's gonna ride for that stuff, it's gonna be Alan or me.
- Galen's our friend.
- I'd like him to be mine.
Believe me, I know a back way.
I can be there and back in no time.
You'd never make it, and Galen will die.
- Galen needs help now!
- Yeah, okay, then go.
Go!
If he just hadn't moved.
A tiger scorpion never stings if you don't move.
[ Hoofbeats ]
Now, remember what I said.
Stay off of the leg.
Excuse me, but my brother's been bitten by a tiger scorpion.
- How long ago?
- A couple of minutes ago, right down the road--
Are you telling the truth?
If it's been any longer, the antidote won't help.
I am telling the truth.
Wait here.
[ Sighs ]
This is to be given by mouth as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Halt!
We'll make camp here.
We could stay in the village, but there are too many loudmouthed humans here for the race.
[ Horse Neighing ]
[ Neighing Continues ]
Hyah!
Did you see his face?
I think it was the blacksmith's son, but I'm not sure.
Shoot him!
Oh! 
After him!
[ Hoofbeats Approaching ]
He's back.
- You made it. 
Thanks.
- Use this immediately.
Nice work, Gregor.
We're indebted to you for Galen.
Good boy.
Martin says it takes about half an hour for the antidote to work.
If it works.
What's this?
What happened?
[ Gregor ] It's a bullet wound. 
I was seen.
Now we are in trouble.
The bullet was stopped by the shoulder blade. 
It's nothing serious.
Just be glad they missed me.
Let's get him into the barn.
I'll see if I can dig that bullet out.
- [ Moaning ] 
- Stay with him, Pete.
That horse looks like it's been wounded.
- I'll see if I can't lend a hand.
- Right.
Let me take a look at that.
I've had some experience with horses.
It's not too bad.
Give me a knife.
You hold his head tight.
[ Whinnies ]
[ Hoofbeats Approaching ]
Quick, Gregor!
Out of sight! 
Go on!
[ Whinnies ]
[ Whinnying Continues ]
Was it you riding the horse?
Do you deny it?
I don't deny anything. 
This horse has been hurt. 
He's gotta be taken care of.
[ Zandar ] Take him to the village.
We'll make an example of him!
- I rode the horse.
- So, it was him after all.
Come on, Gregor.
Don't lie just to save my neck.
Please! 
He-He's young.
He meant no harm.
His own father confirms it.
Let the other one go free.
I won't be so easy on you if you ever lie to me again.
- [ Horse Whinnies ] 
- Seize him!
No! 
Please!
[ Groans ]
[ Zandar ] Very, very foolish.
You'll be invited to witness the execution... as part of the celebration after the race.
[ Laughing ]
Here's your new saddle, Prefect Barlow.
You'll find it very good.
Your horse will run well under it.
It's no use.
We have no chance of winning the race.
Urko's horse will win as usual.
It doesn't seem fair.
Fair? 
When has Urko ever been fair?
Look at the way he transferred me here from Kaymak.
[ Sighs ] Yes, and the stakes-- half my land and half my horses if I lose.
And, of course, I'll lose.
[ Sighs ]
[ Hammering Metal ]
Martin, Galen's gonna be fine.
- Pete and I talked it over.
- We want to help Gregor.
If there was any way, do you think I'd be here working?
We can talk to the prefect.
We'll tell him Gregor was only riding to save an ape's life.
The prefect will not listen to humans.
Then we'll try something else.
We're gonna look around.
Venton is a small village, isn't it?
- We don't need identification?
- The new prefect, Barlow,
- lets humans come and go freely.
- Barlow?
- Barlow?
- Galen.
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in bed.
Oh, no, I'm fine. 
Is that the same Barlow who used to be prefect at Kaymak?
Yes, that's what they say.
- Well-- 
- Wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking.
We'll talk to Barlow.
You belong in bed.
Oh, no, no, no.
He's a friend of mine.
I think he'd pay more attention if I talked to him.
We'll tell him we're delivering your message.
- You're too weak from the scorpion.
-[ Galen ] Fine.
And just to make it more convincing, I'll go along and faint in his presence.
- Very funny.
-Is Barlow really your friend?
Would he listen?
Could he help to save Gregor?
I'll do everything I can.
- Come along. 
What are we waiting for?
- Galen, be reasonable.
Venton's five miles from here.
You're not strong enough to walk.
An ape of my wealth and position, with two human servants, walk?
[ Scoffs ] I can borrow a horse, can't I, Martin?
- Right away.
- Ah!
You two walk.
And please... be sure to maintain a respectable distance behind me, hmm.
[ Knocking ]
- Someone to see you, sir.
- Who?
I don't know, sir. 
He didn't give his name, but he said he's a friend of yours from Kaymak.
Please come in.
Ah, Galen.
And Virdon and Burke.
What are you doing here? 
Don't you know they're still looking for you?
Of course, but I simply had to see you.
You are looking wonderful.
Oh, you probably need my help again.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, not us.
- But a friend of ours.
- A human arrested for riding a horse.
Oh, that one.
Young Gregor.
- He's a friend of yours?
- Yes.
There is absolutely nothing I can do.
- But he saved my life.
- Galen was stung by a scorpion.
I'd have died if Gregor hadn't come to town to get that antidote.
He did it for one of your own. 
If you can get to Zaius and tell him that--
You suggest I appeal to Zaius because he saved the life of an outlaw?
You don't have to put it that way.
Of course not.
Come on, Barlow, be reasonable.
Well, there was a time when I tried to be reasonable.
Now I'm less reasonable and more safe.
- [ Chuckles ] 
- I hate it here.
I want to go home, back to Kaymak.
There's a chance that I can if I keep my record clean.
Is a comfortable job more important than saving a boy's life?
I have sympathy for humans when they behave themselves and know their place.
But that boy's a fool.
- He deserves punishment.
- For saving Galen's life?
It's a wonder the horse didn't throw the boy.
These laws protect humans as well.
Only apes know how to handle horses.
I grew up on horses.
I've been riding since I was seven.
No, no, no, no.
Humans can't ride like apes.
For what it's worth, Alan's as good a rider as anybody in this whole world.
[ Barlow ] He telling the truth?
My friends don't lie.
[ Barlow ] Would you--
Would you be willing to prove that your skill is not only talk?
- What about Gregor?
- Well, let me see how you ride first, then we'll talk about Gregor.
All right.
[ Whinnying ]
- Never been ridden, right?
- Even without a rider, he runs like the wind, but she's a killer.
No ape has been able to ride him.
Forget it.
Oh, so you're not the great rider you say you are.
Now, you give me one good reason why I should risk my neck on a wild horse.
[ Horse Whinnies ]
If you can ride him,
I'll be very helpful to you.
Uh-huh.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Good.
Saddle him up, Martin.
Hyah!
Come on! 
Come on, baby!
Come on!
[ Continues Yelling ]
[ Alan Yelling, Horse Snorting ]
Come on!
[ Continues Yelling ]
- Look at him.
- I told you he could ride.
Mm-mmm.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on. 
Come on.
Whoa. 
Whoa. 
Whoa.
Here you go.
There. 
You're not as tough as you thought you were.
- [ Panting ] 
- What a beautiful animal.
Good riding, for a human.
- Thank you.
-[ Barlow ] I never saw a horse go so fast.
Maybe that's because you've never seen a human jockey before.
Huh. 
I have a proposition to make to you.
I've been challenged to race my best horse... against the fastest horse in the territory.
I want you to ride Woda.
Virdon can't ride in a race.
He'd be seen.
I have a certain influence with Zaius.
I can get him to make an exception.
- What do you say?
- Why should I say anything?
I'm not interested in racing.
You ride Woda, and I'll get Zaius to pardon your friend, Gregor.
- That is, if you win.
- Okay, you got it.
Wait.
What if he loses?
Well, well, Gregor dies, of course.
But if you don't ride, he's certain to be shot.
- Excuse me. 
Do you know who Urko is?
- Yes, sir.
I just saw him.
Does he come to town often?
No, sir, only for something important like the big race.
Oh.
I won't interfere with your departure in any way.
[ Chuckles ]
I knew I couldn't trust Barlow.
[ Knock At Door ]
Come in.
Barlow, what is this I hear?
Are you seriously going to use a human as a jockey in the race?
I have received permission from Zaius.
[ Laughing ] You're a bigger fool than I thought.
All Zaius has done is to make certain that your horse will lose to mine.
We shall see.
Who is this human... who's foolish enough to ride against one of my apes?
What does it matter?
He's just a human.
Well, has he ever ridden a horse before?
[ Hesitantly ] Yes, he's quite good.
I trained him myself.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, in that case, you won't mind if we...
- raise the stakes just a little bit.
- How much?
Instead of half your horses, all of them, if you lose.
And all of your lands.
And if I win?
- What do you want?
- Transfer me back to Kaymak.
Hmm. 
Well, if that's what you want.
I'm determined to win this race.
Everything I have depends on it.
You're going to win.
When Urko sees Alan on your horse, he's gonna kill him... and us too.
I don't understand you.
Don't you feel guilty about tricking us?
Absolutely.
Well, that's a big help.
Well, what was I to do?
I was forced into this race and my entire future depends on it.
And, besides, I wasn't sure that Urko was coming.
Oh, and I used to boast about honor among apes.
Oh, speaking of honor, I don't like to spread gossip, but I've heard talk that Urko's horse doesn't always win by fair means.
Is this designed to cheer us up?
I'm only trying to be a big help to us both.
Come on, Galen.
But where?
Well, if Urko has all this going for him, maybe we should jiggle a few odds to get things in our favor.
Hmm.
[ Scoffs ]
[ Galen ] Make it deep and muddy.
I wish I could help you. 
Ah, but you've got to keep up appearances.
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, if someone saw me... doing something like that, they'd say, "Why are you doing such a thing?
Such work is for humans."
Otherwise, I would be right in there giving you a hand.
Hey, will you cut it out?
You love it.
Anyway, I'm doing what you asked me to do, even if I don't understand it.
Do you think this is really gonna help Virdon?
You're getting warm, buddy.
You're getting warm.
Warm? 
I'm not the least bit warm.
Sometimes I do not understand you at all.
First of all, you have me carve a spool with notches in it and now--
[ Clacking ]
What are you complaining about? 
I'm the one who's doing all the hard work.
- You're terrible.
- Whee!
Thinner, Martin.
You gotta make it thinner.
A racehorse has got to have thin, lightweight shoes on his hooves.
Urko's racehorses use the same shoes as any other horse.
That's the point.
That's where we have an advantage.
In a horse race, every little bit helps.
If it'll help save my son,
I'll make them featherlight.
[ Urko ] Twist them, but leave the way open at the side.
Kagon will be told to ride my horse across to where he will be clear of the vines.
The human will be stupid enough to jump across the middle.
I want to be sure he falls.
More vines here.
Make it thicker.
More vines here.
There you go, Martin.
With those shoes, the only thing that gorilla's gonna see is Woda's tail.
I still don't see how you hope to beat Urko.
His horses never lose.
Come on, Martin.
Nobody's got this race sewn up.
Even if you do win... what's to keep Urko from killing you just for daring to ride a horse?
I'm not gonna ride up to Urko and see if he shoots me.
We got a couple of tricks up our sleeve.
I know you're doing this for Gregor, and I thank you.
But if you trick Urko, Gregor will surely pay.
If everything goes all right, we'll bail out Gregor and I'll be in the clear.
I've got to take Urko's horse to him.
I'm gonna ask him to let me take Gregor's place.
I don't care what happens to me.
This way,you won't have to ride, you'll be out of danger.
And so will Gregor.
Uh-uh, Urko doesn't make that kind of deal.
Look, Gregor's only chance is for me to win that race.
I think I've got a pretty good shot at it.
[ Clicks Tongue ] Come on.
Beat that if you can.
Ah!
[ Laughs ]
I'm a little out of practice.
Barlow!
- What about the tree?
- We have something special planned.
- What?
- A net.
Better work.
Zilo, you know you're to be in place 50 yards before the end of the race.
If the human is winning when he passes you, shoot him.
Of course.
The human will surely lose the race.
Shouldn't I shoot him anyway, just for riding?
[ Groans ] Zaius has given his permission.
This one time. 
Anyway, it isn't important enough to kill the human... just because he looses the race.
We still have the other young human to serve as an example.
- Urko, the blacksmith.
- Huh?
What do you want?
Excuse me.
I'm Martin.
I'm the one who shod your horse.
What do you want?
I can be of help to you.
I also shod the horse Barlow will race against you.
I know how to make sure you'll win.
Is there any doubt about my winning the race?
Yes, Barlow's horse, Woda, is very fast.
But I know how to fix his shoes with wedges... that will cause great pain and slow him down.
I know where to put them, and it wouldn't be found out until too late.
Why do you want to help me against Barlow, who pampers all the humans?
It's for my son, Gregor.
He's the one that's been sentenced to die.
Please, he's very young.
He didn't know.
He just didn't think. 
He--
Let him go, and I promise you he'll never ride a horse again.
I'll help you win, Gregor will be safe... and there'll be no need to worry about the other man riding Barlow's horse.
Say nothing about this to anyone.
If my horse wins the race,
I'll set your son free.
Thank you. 
Thank you.
Zilo!
Release the human from the cage.
At the start?
What-What if the blacksmith is lying?
What is done to a human who tries to run away and escape?
In the meantime, if the human is winning, kill him before he reaches the finish line.
- Uh-huh.
- If the human is losing, kill him after he reaches the finish line.
[ Mutters ]
Just a matter of when.
[ Horse Whinnying ]
Look at that horse.
Oh, a magnificent horse.
I love racing!
Well, Barlow, we've finally arrived at the moment of truth.
Not quite. 
The moment of truth comes at the finish line.
[ Laughs ] Well, we'll see.
It's quite a show you're putting on here today.
We always try to please.
Zandar, is everything prepared?
Everything will be to your total satisfaction, Urko.
Good. 
Barlow, this may come as a surprise to you, but I dislike losing so much,
I've always made it a habit of winning.
I always thought the enjoyment of a race depended on being unsure of the outcome.
[ Laughing ] Well, don't worry about my enjoyment of a race.
I intend to have a marvelous time.
-[ Horses Whinnying ] 
- Ah, there are the horses.
- [ Snorting ] -[ Urko ] Well, I see your horse,
- but where's your wonderful human jockey?
- Oh, he'll, uh--
I'm certain he'll be here.
There's time.
The race won't begin for a while yet.
It's all right if he doesn't turn up.
I don't mind winning by default.
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Whinnying ]
I don't like the way that horse is acting.
I don't like anything about this whole race.
Well, Alan, now is probably as good a time as any.
-[ Whinnying Continues ] 
- Be careful.
You better take off first, Galen.
[ Crowd Applauding, Whistling ]
[ Horse Whinnying ]
- There's something the matter with that horse.
-[ Whinnying ]
[ Pete ] Maybe he's just nervous being near the crowd.
We'll soon find out.
- See you after the race, Pete.
- Yeah. 
Hey.
Be careful.
- You too.
- Yeah.
[ Crowd Chattering ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
[ Clacking Noisemaker]
[ Chattering Continues ]
[ Continues Clacking ]
[ Woda Whinnying ]
[ Laughing ]
He's a wonderful jockey, your human, except he can't sit on a horse.
[ Laughing Continues ]
Hey, that's great.
You look awful.
- Urko would never recognize you.
-[ Woda Whinnying ]
Whoa. 
Hey, hey.
Easy, easy.
Come on. 
Hey-- What's the matter with him, Martin?
There's nothing wrong with him.
He'll be fine. 
Good luck.
Hey, Pete, look at this.
Give me your knife.
What's holding up the race?
- Races never start on time.
- Well, this one does!
That's it. 
Let me get that one.
[ Grunts ]
- Start the race.
- Get ready for the start!
- [ Grunting ] 
- Same way.
Okay, good.
Let's get the other one too.
I said start the race now!
Bring your horses to the starting line.
Three times through the village and around the course.
- [ Grunting ] 
- Now pull it. 
Okay.
[ Fires Rifle ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
[ Cheering ]
Good start.
[ Chuckling ]
You put those wedges in the horse's shoes. 
Why?
- You didn't take them out.
- Yes, of course I did!
I promised Urko I'd make Virdon lose if Gregor was spared.
Alan's riding in this race to save your son.
He can't! 
Urko has a gorilla there to kill him if he wins!
[ Crowd Chattering ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
- Two more to go.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Cheering Continues ] - [ Urko ] There he goes! 
There he goes!
[ Cheering ]
[ Hoofbeats Approaching ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
-[ Hoofbeats Approaching ] - [ Laughing ]
[ Urko ] Well, Barlow, it's all over.
- Too bad, Barlow.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Hoofbeats Passing ] - [ Cheering ]
I'm going to win!
I'm going to win!
I think it's time we made our move.
Careful.
Don't move.
-[ Hoofbeats Approaching ] 
- Ah.
-[ Hoofbeats Approaching ] 
- Oh, I won! 
I won! 
I won!
-[ Hoofbeats Passing ] 
- That's Virdon. 
Kill him! 
Kill him!
- Come on, kill him! 
Kill him!
- [ Shuddering ]
Kill him! 
Shoot him!
[ Firing Pistol ]
[ Gunfire Continues ]
- That was Virdon! 
Your jockey!
-[ Crowd Clamoring ]
Your human jockey was Virdon, the fugitive!
Is that a fact? 
Oh, well, it has nothing to do with our bet.
[ Grumbling ]
Get the horses!
Follow them! 
Follow them!
[ Clamoring Continues ]
- Did Barlow's horse win the race?
- Yes. 
Now you can run.
Why should I run if I'm supposed to be free?
You run because I tell you to run!
No. 
Something's wrong.
Move out of there, or I'll shoot you right where you are.
[ Groaning, Growling ]
[ Screaming ]
- [ Crowd Clamoring ] - [ Guard Groaning ]
- [ Clamoring Continues ] - [ Chuckling ]
-[ Women Screaming ] -[ Alan ] Pete!
-[ Women Screaming ] -[ Alan ] Pete!
- [ Crowd Clamoring ] 
- Ya-hoo!
Hyah! 
Hyah! 
Hyah!
[ Whinnies ]
-[ Hoofbeats Approaching ] 
- Come on! 
Come on!
This way!
Let's go!
Hyah! 
Hyah!
[ Coughs ]
- Have you seen the fugitive?
- Yes, with you, when he won the race.
Barlow, if I thought you knew anything about this beforehand--
Oh, how could I dream that a fugitive would dare to ride a horse...
- under Urko's very nose?
- I don't trust you, Barlow.
Oh, Urko, I'm an honorable ape.
I don't lie, I don't break promises... and I always pay my debts, when I lose.
- The payment has been arranged!
- Yes, I know.
- I'm on my way back to Kaymak.
- [ Grumbles ]
I heard what you said to Urko.
You don't lie. [ Scoffs ]
Perhaps not, but you certainly know how to tie the truth into a knot.
I also said I don't break promises.
Where are they?
Uh-huh. 
You two may come and live with me in Kaymak.
There you'll be safe.
But you...
-are not to ride on horses...
- Yes, Prefect.
- when I'm watching.
- Thank you, Prefect.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Friend.
Friend.

My name is Molly Caffrey and I work for the Federal government.
I deal in worst-case scenarios, the unthinkable.
On September 16, 2005, the unthinkable happened.
An extraterrestrial object appeared off the bow of a naval freighter.
The entire crew was exposed to a high-frequency signal.
Some died instantly.
Others began to change.
They are now stronger, more resilient.
They dream of alien landscapes, and they are driven by the impulse to infect others.
Several of the crewman are now loose in the United States.
They will strike anytime, anyplace, anyone.
Their goal:
to turn us into them.
But... 
I have a plan to stop them.
That plan is called "Threshold."
MAN:
Okay, guys, lights out.
Lights out, guys.
Go to bed, Harry.
Richard?
Richard?
Security, we've got a runner, South Wing. 
It's Tate.
Security, come back.
He's headed your way.
Another nugget from the data mine:
Intercepted a police report outside of Cleveland, Ohio. 
Thanks.
Escaped mental patient.
Cranked a guard's head around, pulled apart an orderly, and then tore through an electrified fence.
If these ETs are trying to hijack our planet by turning us into them, why in the hell pick a guy in a loony bin?
And how could he have been exposed to the bio-forming signal? 
Another UFO?
Maybe there's less here than meets the eye. 
This one is not for us.
We should definitely check this out.
Caffrey, you wrote the Threshold protocols.
You need to be here to implement them.
You don't have time to chase down every yeti, crop circle or psycho that comes across our desk.
I understand...
Send Cavennaugh!
If there's something worth investigating, he'll let you know.
He won't have to.
This is a crime scene photo of the escapee's room.
Is this what I think it is?
Paintings of the glass forest, just like the dream I had.
Enjoy the Buckeye state.
OFFICER: 
You can understand my being curious.
Why do people in Washington care about some nutcake?
FENWAY:
You been in Washington?
CAVENNAUGH:
We're going to need all the information you've got on the escapee. 
Richard Tate.
He's kind of a local legend.
Back in '79, he set his house on fire.
He was only 13 years old.
Burned his family alive.
( man screams )
Found not guilty by reason of insanity. 
Surprise, surprise.
Committed to Bridgeview, where he's apparently been living quietly until tonight.
Do you have a BOLO on him?
Went out this morning.
His picture's plastered all over the state.
He'll probably come back when he hears what happened to rock and roll.
This his room?
Mm-hmm.
Nothing's been touched.
Look familiar?
Yeah.
According to Tate's profile, he's a paranoid schizophrenic.
Was he outwardly violent?
No. 
But you have to remember that by the time I came here, he'd been on a regimen of valproates for years.
I mean, he might as well have been furniture.
In '96, we started him on olanzapine-- less harsh and, in Tate's case, just as effective.
Until about a week ago, we had him down to five milligrams a day.
What happened a week ago?
We had to up the dosage.
He was having nightmares, waking up, screaming, that kind of thing.
He had delusions that there are aliens among us-- not atypical for these kinds of illnesses.
You see, extraterrestrials often represent our darker selves.
When the mind can't accept its own nature, it creates ghosts or aliens or some other handy bogeyman.
Did he describe his dreams to you?
They're up on the walls.
What you are looking at is the landscape of a different world:
the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic.
Note the glass trees, indicating a fragile sense of self...
Thank you for your time, Dr. Urbassik.
Anything else you need, just let me know.
CAVENNAUGH: 
All right. 
You bet.
All right, let's make sure he doesn't have any paintings in his possession or photos or video.
Last thing we need is that genius writing a book about his star patient.
I have men at his house right now.
Is there a civil right you haven't violated?
Subsection Alpha-14 of your protocol:
"Evidence of alien incursion,
"no matter how indirect, must be obtained by any means necessary."
I see you read the classics.
So, what do you got?
Well, we got years worth of journal entries, stories, poetry...
There's random lists, doodles...
None of it seems to make much sense.
I had a professor once who said "It's impossible to write anything without telling the reader about yourself."
Let's get Ramsey here.
Maybe he can sort through this.
( flipping pages )
Might give us an idea where Richard Tate went.
CAVENNAUGH: 
It looks like we got a new guy in our forest.
Is that what it looks like in your dreams?
Yeah. 
You?
Like he took a picture.
In order to get out,
Tate had to withstand a 9,000-volt pulse.
Impressive.
It gets even more impressive.
The way these fences are designed, if the pulse doesn't work, both the current and the voltage are automatically increased to a lethal level.
How high?
Did you ever touch the end of a nine-volt battery with the tip of your tongue?
Yeah. 
No.
Well, we're looking for a guy who could suck on a car battery all day and not feel it.
Our stun weapons aren't going to be enough.
Call Lucas-- tell him to boost the amperage and get a new set of hardware out here as soon as possible.
Is that a piece of fence missing?
Apparently, Tate's not indestructible.
He cut himself on the way out-- left us some skin cells and blood.
I snipped around the sample to protect it.
Good.
Anything on the victims?
Nothing yet.
Everything's packed up and ready to go back to Threshold for analysis.
I also want to get blood samples of everybody at the hospital.
No one else is showing any signs.
Until we know how Tate got infected, we cover every contingency.
Oh, Mr. Baylock.
Lucas, there's a good chance we're going to be working together for quite a while.
I think you can call me "J.T." Yes, sir.
What's on your mind?
Uh, weapons.
Dr. Caffrey wants me to juice up the amps in our stun-shells.
Why?
Something about that infected mental patient breaking through an electrified fence.
They're worried they'll need more stopping power.
So, could you just sign off on a few things for me?
300-amp laser-diodes... uranium...?
You building a bomb in there, son?
Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay?
They wanted these weapons, like, five minutes ago.
Ramsey's not here to help me with the math.
So if you could just approve this stuff, I would greatly appreciate it, okay?
Just try not to blow up the building. 
Yes, sir.
Mr. Miller?
I'm Molly Caffrey.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Richard Tate.
And I'd like somebody to play with.
Well, I guess we're both out of luck.
Oh, oh...
Oh, good!
Yeah...
Oh...
What would you like to ask me?
You were a friend of his, right?
Oh, yeah, I was a... 
I'd known him for, um... two years.
C-1.
Miss.
Did he ever talk about what he'd do if he got out?
B-6.
Miss. 
Richard... 
Richard was never gonna get out of here.
Did he ever talk about killing his family?
Well, once he said that he burned them alive and he could hear them screaming.
And then, once, he said they were already dead when he set the fire.
Uh, D-7.
Miss.
Did he ever talk about nightmares?
Uh, G-10.
Hit.
We all have nightmares.
That's not an answer.
Couple of days ago, Richard warned me that aliens were coming and that we were all going to change.
Did he say how?
No. 
He just said that it was gonna be soon and that he had some unfinished business to take care of. 
A-2? 
Miss.
Uh... 
Mr. Miller, this is very important.
Do you know where Richard Tate is?
No, I don't.
But, just between you and me,
I've been having some pretty weird alien dreams myself.
When did they start?
Just about the same time as Richard's.
I mean, it's like I'm turning into an alien.
I can't fight it.
I start getting the big bug eyes and the antennas.
You know, maybe you could talk to the doctors.
Maybe they could give me some more meds like they gave Richard.
I think we're done here.
But you're going to talk to the doctor?
I don't think so.
But thanks for your time.
All right.
Hey, good news for a change.
None of the other patients tested positive for genetic mutations.
Then it's only Tate.
Mm. 
Still no sign of him?
Not yet. 
I've got agents searching the town, local police-- of course, they have no idea what they're dealing with.
I don't get it. 
How could one random psychopath locked in a cell become infected in the first place?
Because it wasn't random.
There has to be a reason why it happened to this particular person.
But there's no evidence the alien signal was ever here.
Yeah, but he's having the dreams. 
How?
That UFO was hundreds of miles away over the Atlantic Ocean.
You're saying there's some kind of connection? 
Maybe.
Maybe he was exposed indirectly, like Cadet Janklow was.
Maybe some people are more receptive to the signal.
What, like human antennae?
Why not? 
What if some people can pick up the signal from far away?
So there's a guy in China sitting in his pagoda, drawing the glass forest.
I don't think so. 
Lucas said the signal only has a radius of 3,000 meters.
It's basic science.
Basic science is out the window, in case you haven't noticed.
How many times have you read Tate's file?
( sighing ):
I don't know, like, 50, and I can't find anything.
Let me see it-- maybe it needs a fresh pair of eyes.
I hope yours work better than mine.
Okay, Mr. Tate... talk to me.
Who is it?
Oh, hi, uh... sorry to bother you, but is this your dog?
Because it was running around outside, the gate was open...
Oh, thanks so much.
I didn't know he got loose.
Shut up, shut up, shut up...
Shut up...
Shut up.
Shut up. 
Shut up.
Don't scream.
Don't scream!
Does it have the date?
Does it say we're getting married?
Does it say "You're invited"?
Okay, then why would I care what font we use?
It's a wedding invitation, right?
Okay, look, just e-mail me your top five.
I'll try to glance at them tonight.
Honey, I'm not snapping. 
I just...
I'm really swamped right now.
I know.
I want it to be perfect, too.
Uh, look, I got to go.
I'll call you later. 
Hey... how's it going?
I've boosted the power of the stun weapons and I've added a variable control to the amperage, so our guys will have a choice in the field.
I'll be done in about an hour.
I'm not talking about the weapons.
Oh.
It's great.
( clears throat ) It's just great.
Plucked out of existence, eight days with barely any sleep...
I can't even tell my fiancee what I'm doing here, when I might be back.
"Well, you see, Pumpkin, uh, an extraterrestrial probe
"landed in the ocean and it sent out this weird-ass signal
"that mutates your DNA and turns you into an alien, see?
"And it infected a bunch of people on the ship,
"and now they're running loose in the general population.
"And, oh, by the way, I might be infected as well. 
How was your day?"
I'm... 
I'm done ranting now, thanks.
This fiancee of yours, uh...
Rachel. 
Rachel.
She's a pediatrician, right?
Clinical research or something?
Yeah.
Now, I might be able to pull some strings, get her a posting over at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda.
You're kidding me.
Given what we're up against, you may be here for a long time.
( sighs ) Thank you.
Well, thank Dr. Caffrey, they're her protocols.
Now... get these weapons out in the field.
Right.
Yeah?
Anything?
Quite a bit, actually.
I just don't know what it all means.
More artwork?
I think it's Tate's version of an identicon.
The image of the farmhouse keeps reappearing in conjunction with anything having to do with the murders.
Probably the farm where it happened.
He must be haunted by the memories.
What about these words?
"Cat, brother, oak tree, door..." Well, could be random words, or it could be a code based on a system of personal mnemonics.
See how some of the words are repeated? 
Right.
Well, can you crack it?
Might give us a clue where he went. 
Eventually, but I've got a lot of reading to do.
All right, well, start chipping away.
I've got not one, but two surprises for you.
This isn't Tate's blood.
What?
I checked his hospital records.
Tate's blood type is AB-negative.
This is O-positive.
Surprise number two?
I compared the sample against the one we found on the fence.
It's the same.
And it's mutated-- triple helix.
We have another infectee on our hands.
So Tate didn't break out alone.
More likely, someone else who was infected broke him out.
Check the infected sample against the Big Horn crew manifest.
What would one of the crew members be doing here with Tate?
I have a feeling that'll be our third surprise.
FENWAY: 
Whoever broke Tate out cut himself pretty badly.
We should be looking for someone with an injury.
I need a shovel.
Do you have a shovel?
Do you have a pick or an ax or anything?
Okay, I know that you're not going to scream while I'm gone.
And I know that you're not gonna try and run away, right?
I've got the DNA sequence on the blood drop you found.
FENWAY ( over phone ): 
Okay, now, I want you to bring up the Big Horn crew manifest and go into the DNA profiles for the missing crewmen. 
Stand by.
How'd we get DNA samples from people we can't find?
Do I ask you how to shoot people?
It's one of the first things we did.
We sent med techs to the crewmen's homes and collected, uh, hair follicles, dandruff, toothbrushes...
I've got the profiles, Dr. Fenway. 
Right. ( phone rings )
Cavennaugh. 
What do you got?
Separate the ACTG string with the new sample.
Cross-check it against the profiles.
See if we come up with a winner.
It's Lieutenant Novak.
Raymond Novak.
Well, we better let our search teams know they're looking for both Tate and Novak.
BAYLOCK: 
Anybody want to hazard a guess as to why he was so keen to get inside a mental ward in the middle of Nowhere, Ohio?
They got to be working together somehow.
BAYLOCK: 
We'll run a background check on Novak and Tate, see if there's any connection in their past.
Why don't we just ask Tate?
The BOLO panned out.
He's been spotted about five miles from here, at a construction site.
AGENT: 
Richard Tate!
Stop right there!
Freeze!
Go! 
Go!
Mr. Tate, come on out.
We know you're here.
I got him.
This way.
This area's secure, right? 
Yes, sir.
Perimeter is secure. 
He's here. 
Find him.
You have two options, Mr. Tate.
You can climb on down, hassle-free, or we can go up there and drag you down, and trust me, you won't enjoy that.
I'm not going back!
Climb on down! 
Now!
Nice and slow.
There you go.
You don't understand.
I understand, trust me. 
Now climb down.
Tate, stop!
No! 
No!
No!
Please!
What do you got?
600 pages, and here's what I know about our man Tate.
His favorite dish is creamy tuna surprise, which they serve each and every Thursday.
Couldn't have been much of a surprise.
In fact, he's catalogued every meal he's had for the past 15 years.
His vast canon of poetry has an annoying reliance on approximate rhyme.
And before he started painting glass trees, he was obsessed with his old farmhouse.
Bocas del Toro (meaning "Mouths of the Bull") is a province of Panama. The province is in the northwestern part of the country, bordering Costa Rica. The provincial capital is the city of Bocas del Toro on Colón Island.
History.

= = = Boston accent = = =
The Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English. It is spoken specifically in the city of Boston, its suburbs, and much of eastern Massachusetts. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire and Maine. The accent originated with the Puritans who came to the area from East Anglia in the 17th century. It was also influenced by 19th and 20th century immigrants from Ireland. This resulted in the distinct r-dropping (locally called "wicked natural") dialect found in modern costal Massachusetts.
Non-rhoticity.
The traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers tend to use more of a rhotic accent than older speakers from the Boston region. The Boston accent is pronounced with a “broad A”. The letter "r" is dropped only in certain words like 'car' and 'hard'. For example, a person might “pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.”
Lexicon.
Some words used in the Boston area are:

= = = Flash Airlines Flight 604 = = =
Flash Airlines Flight 604, a Boeing 737-300, was a flight from Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to Paris, France, via Cairo. On January 3, 2004 the plane crashed into the Red Sea just moments after take-off at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport. All 135 passengers and 13 crew members on-board the plane died. The cause of the crash remains disputed, but it was suggested to be spatial disorientation by the Captain.
The crash remains Egypt's deadliest air-disaster, until the bombing of Kogalymavia Flight 9268, with 224 deaths. The crash is also the worst crash of a Boeing 737-300.
The flight took off at 04:44 Eastern European Time (0244 GMT) from runway 22R at the Egyptian resort en route to Paris via Cairo. After taking off, the aircraft should have climbed and initiated a left turn to follow the air corridor to Cairo designated by the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. The captain appeared surprised when the autopilot was engaged, which he immediately switched off again. The copilot warned the captain that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right, the captain said "OK come out".
The ailerons were briefly returned to neutral before being commanded to increase the bank to the right, likely by the captain in a state of surprise. The aircraft reached an altitude of 5,460 feet (1,660 m) with a 50-degree bank when the copilot exclaimed "Overbank" repeatedly when the bank angle kept increasing. The bank angle was 111 degrees right, while the pitch attitude was 43 degrees nose down at an altitude of 3,470 feet (1,060 m).
The observer on the flight deck, also a pilot, but a trainee on this 737 variant, shouted "Retard power, retard power, retard power", to get the captain to pull the throttles back so that the aircraft stopped gaining speed. Both throttles were moved to idle; the captain appeared to regain control of the airplane. However the speed increased, activating the overspeed warning.
At 04:45, the aircraft impacted the water about 8.2 nautical miles (15.2 km) south of the airport. The impact occurred while the aircraft was in a 24 degree right bank, 24 degree nose-down attitude, travelling at 416 knots (770 km/h, 478 mph,) and pulling 3.9g (38 m/22). All 148 passengers and crew were lost.
Most of the passengers aboard the flight were French tourists from the Paris metropolitan area. A provisional passenger list, dated January 5 January 2004, stated that twelve entire French families had boarded the flight.

A:	So.
B:	Right,
B:	yeah,
B:	well, when, uh, we lived in San Antonio,
B:	I grew up around San Antonio,
B:	and it's always been a very large, uh, city, and increasingly growing.
B:	It's has kind of the split population.
B:	Um, there's a lot of retired military, uh, individuals that live there,
B:	and then there's a very large Hispanic population there.
B:	And the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic, uh, gang crime in the city
A:	Oh,
B:	and that has, uh, been the worse thing that we've seen happening.
A:	Does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the, uh, retired people's community,
A:	or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods?
B:	Um, the majority of the actual gang crimes, like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods,
B:	but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies, rape and, uh, car crime.
B:	There's a very large, uh, or very high percentage of car theft.
B:	And San San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico,
B:	so a lot of the, uh, cars go to, uh, you know, shops,
B:	and they take them apart,
B:	and a lot of them go over the border, especially like Mercedes.
B:	A lot of those, those in the, the Z, uh, the Z cars, the Datsun cars end up over the border,
B:	and uh
A:	So that's a big concern if you live there,  is to really lock your car up .
B:	very much so,
B:	very much so,
B:	in fact, for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light, they had a rash of where people were, when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up.
B:	So now, ever since then, when you drive into the city, most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car, until they get down there,
B:	and once you've reached the, the river walk area, which is the tourist area, it's usually pretty safe during the day, if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys, and, um, you know, or alone.
B:	If you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops, it's very nice.
B:	But at, at evening, um, again, you, they have the high tourist area, the river walk area, which is nice,
B:	but you don't want to get off the beaten track.
B:	Um, there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight.
B:	And so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage, uh, alone.
A:	Oh, my, it sounds like, um, San Juan, Puerto Rico,
A:	we were there just, well for a lay over
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, well, it wasn't a lay over,
A:	we were, we had, we were staying at the other end of the island,
A:	and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was at night,
A:	and this boy really wanted to go on the beach,
A:	and they look at you crazy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you don't go on the beach.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's a big tourist town, you know,
A:	don't they, don't people go for a walk on the beach at night?
A:	And they said, no,
A:	it's very safe in the daytime
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but at night, they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens, pretty much telling people, be wary, you know, and get off the beach.
B:	It's just so sad, you know,
B:	it is just really so sad, you know,
B:	it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more.
B:	Um, in San Antonio I don't know what the answer is.
B:	Education, I think, is a lot of it.
B:	Um, so many of the kids are drop outs.
B:	Um, uh, there's a lot of drugs that go on, and that they just have hopeless lives.
B:	They, they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels.
B:	I think education helps a little bit there.
B:	Um, then again, I don't know really what steps there are that they,
A:	Well, what they, what they say they try to do is to get the kids, um, early and young.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And what we have here in Burlington, which it doesn't cost a lot of money, but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They set up kids with elderly people, in the winter time they shovel their snow.
A:	They have a big brother, big sister program.
A:	They have bottle drives,
A:	they have cleanup outings.
A:	And they have also organized fun activities like gyms, going to the beach, and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer,
A:	and they have gyms open.
A:	And it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs after school, you might keep them
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but you, again, you need that one on one like a big brother, trying to keep the younger kid, you know, tell him, hey stay in school,
A:	it'll get better, you know,
A:	so that your mom doesn't have a job
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and she doesn't work,
A:	you don't know,
A:	you can be better than that.
A:	You don't have to live on the, you know, for a street life.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But.
B:	Uh-huh,
B:	that's good, that sounds like they've got a lot going on there.
A:	Yeah,
A:	but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here.
A:	I mean, um, they can deal with that scale.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They might have five hundred troubled youths.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	When you have five thousand troubled youths, plus when you're getting into well, the kids now, it's twelve years old
A:	and they're selling drugs
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun.
B:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's just, it's the morals of the people which, I mean, I guess we, everybody's responsible for the society,
A:	but, if I had a child that, that did things so bad,
A:	it's not, they don't care about anybody
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	these people they're stealing from, they're just the big bad rich guy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we don't have it,
A:	so we deserve it,
A:	and we should take it.
